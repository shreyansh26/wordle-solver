We are starting the game. We don't have any previous feedback, so we need to pick a starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E. This covers several common letters.

 Since the rules require a valid 5-letter English word, ""CRANE"" is valid.

We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all (x)
- R: not in the word at all (x)
- A: present in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in CRANE, but feedback is wrong position) (-)
- N: present in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE) (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the positions where they appeared are incorrect, but they could be anywhere else.

But note: the positions are relative to the guess. In CRANE:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: E

Feedback: A was marked as ""not in correct position"" meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

Also, we know C, R, E are ABSENT from the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have A somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5 possible for A? But not 3)
- Must have N somewhere (not position 4; positions 1,2,3,5 possible)

And the word does NOT contain: C, R, E.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to include A and N in different positions to pin down their locations, and also include other common letters.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: A and N. We also know C, R, E are out.

We should avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to put A in a position that isn't 3, and N in a position that isn't 4.

Possible structures:

Since A was in position 3 and was wrong, and N in position 4 was wrong, we can try moving A to position 1,2,4, or 5 and N to position 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know where exactly they should be.

Also, we need to cover other letters.

Idea: pick a word that has A and N in different positions, and uses other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words that contain A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Example: ""SANDY"" -> has S, A, N, D, Y.
But let's check positions: in SANDY, A is in position 2, N is in position 3. So we can test if A is at 2? But note A cannot be at 3? Wait, in CRANE A was at 3 and that was wrong. Now if we put A at 2, that's a different position.

But ""SANDY"" is valid.

Another: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. A is at 2, N at 4? But in CRANE, N was at 4 and that was wrong. So if we put N at 4 again, that would be invalid? Wait, no: maybe the word has an N, but not at position 4? So it could be at 4? No, because the feedback for N in CRANE at position 4 was wrong, meaning the N is not at position 4 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we should avoid placing the known letters in the positions that were already tried and failed? Yes.

Specifically:
- A cannot be at position 3 (because in CRANE it was at 3 and wrong).
- N cannot be at position 4 (because in CRANE it was at 4 and wrong).

In our next guess:
- Do not put A at position 3.
- Do not put N at position 4.

For SANDY: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y.
- Here, A is at 2 (which is new) and N is at 3 (which we haven't tested for N: previously N was at 4). So that's safe.

But PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
- A at 2: new
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4 from the first guess (since feedback was - meaning wrong position). So we must NOT put N at 4 again? Actually, we can put it at 4 to test? No, because if we put it at 4, we already know it's incorrect so we would waste a letter? But also, the feedback will tell us if it's there or not? But we know it's not there? So we are explicitly told that position 4 is not N? Exactly.

Therefore, we should avoid positions that we know are incorrect for a letter? Yes.

Since we know N is not at position 4, putting N at position 4 in a new guess would be unproductive because we already know it won't be correct. So we should try other positions.

Thus, for N: avoid position 4. We can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for A: avoid position 3 -> try 1,2,4,5.

Now, let me think of words that have A and N, avoid C,R,E, and place A and N in new positions.

Options:

- Place A at position 2 and N at position 1? Word like ""NASTY"": N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This avoids A at 3 and N at 4? Yes: A at position 2 (not 3) and N at 1 (not 4). Also includes S,T,Y which are common.

- Alternatively, ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But here A is at position 3 (which we know is incorrect) and N at position 4 (which we know is incorrect). So this would be bad because we know A isn't at 3 and N isn't at 4, so none would be in the correct position? We are using them but at positions that we already know are wrong.

Therefore, ""PLANT"" would waste the A and N positions? So better choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively.

So ""NASTY"" is a good candidate: N at 1, A at 2, and then S,T,Y.

We also haven't tested S,T,Y yet.

Another word: ""MANGO""? M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Positions: A is at 2 (not 3), N at 3 (we haven't tested N at 3). Also, avoids positions 3 and 4? Well, the A is at 2 (not the forbidden 3) and N at 3 (not the forbidden 4). So that's okay.

But ""MANGO"" has G and O.

Another: ""STAND"": S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). Oh, A at position 3? Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.

So back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.

Another good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn't at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn't put N at 4.

Thus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.

So let me avoid words with N at position 4.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don't have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.

We can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don't learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both? Actually, we can also try words that include one of them? But since both are present, we might as well try both to get their positions? Especially since we have limited guesses.

So ideally, use both A and N in new positions.

Next word: ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). Positions: A at 1 (not 3 -> good), N at 2 (not 4 -> good). And letters V, I, L.

But V is not very common? Or we don't know.

""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don't have to, but if we don't, we don't get information on N's position? So better to include since we have two known letters.

So words that have A and N:

- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.

List: 
- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible
- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible

Combinations:

We can try:

  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.

""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.

Words without C, R, E.

So ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.

But is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.

But ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.

Common letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tested them.

So I might prefer a word that includes S or T.

Back to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
- This covers S and T.

""NASTY"" seems good.

Another: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.

In fact, the rule doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

So to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn't show duplicates? Also, common strategy.

Thus ""PASTA"" has two A's? So not ideal.

""TASTY"" has two T's? Also not.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.

""PLANT"" same issue.

So ""NASTY"" seems solid.

Or ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.

""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).

In ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).

We know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.

But in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don't know about L? Yes.

But in NASTY: we have S and T.

Since S and T are among the most common, I'd go with ""NASTY"".

Also, if we try NASTY:

- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don't know? We're testing.

We are trying to get feedback on the positions.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NASTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:
- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.

Selected word: **NASTY**  
- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  
- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).

<guess>NASTY</guess>",NASTY,"We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all (x)
- R: not in the word at all (x)
- A: present in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in CRANE, but feedback is wrong position) (-)
- N: present in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE) (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the positions where they appeared are incorrect, but they could be anywhere else.

But note: the positions are relative to the guess. In CRANE:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: E

Feedback: A was marked as ""not in correct position"" meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

Also, we know C, R, E are ABSENT from the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have A somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5 possible for A? But not 3)
- Must have N somewhere (not position 4; positions 1,2,3,5 possible)

And the word does NOT contain: C, R, E.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to include A and N in different positions to pin down their locations, and also include other common letters.

We should try to put A in a position that isn't 3, and N in a position that isn't 4.

Possible structures:

Since A was in position 3 and was wrong, and N in position 4 was wrong, we can try moving A to position 1,2,4, or 5 and N to position 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know where exactly they should be.

Also, we need to cover other letters.

Idea: pick a word that has A and N in different positions, and uses other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words that contain A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Example: ""SANDY"" -> has S, A, N, D, Y.
But let's check positions: in SANDY, A is in position 2, N is in position 3. So we can test if A is at 2? But note A cannot be at 3? Wait, in CRANE A was at 3 and that was wrong. Now if we put A at 2, that's a different position.

But ""SANDY"" is valid.

Another: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. A is at 2, N at 4? But in CRANE, N was at 4 and that was wrong. So if we put N at 4 again, that would be invalid? Wait, no: maybe the word has an N, but not at position 4? So it could be at 4? No, because the feedback for N in CRANE at position 4 was wrong, meaning the N is not at position 4 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we should avoid placing the known letters in the positions that were already tried and failed? Yes.

Specifically:
- A cannot be at position 3 (because in CRANE it was at 3 and wrong).
- N cannot be at position 4 (because in CRANE it was at 4 and wrong).

In our next guess:
- Do not put A at position 3.
- Do not put N at position 4.

For SANDY: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y.
- Here, A is at 2 (which is new) and N is at 3 (which we haven't tested for N: previously N was at 4). So that's safe.

But PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
- A at 2: new
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4 from the first guess (since feedback was - meaning wrong position). So we must NOT put N at 4 again? Actually, we can put it at 4 to test? No, because if we put it at 4, we already know it's incorrect so we would waste a letter? But also, the feedback will tell us if it's there or not? But we know it's not there? So we are explicitly told that position 4 is not N? Exactly.

Therefore, we should avoid positions that we know are incorrect for a letter? Yes.

Since we know N is not at position 4, putting N at position 4 in a new guess would be unproductive because we already know it won't be correct. So we should try other positions.

Thus, for N: avoid position 4. We can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for A: avoid position 3 -> try 1,2,4,5.

Now, let me think of words that have A and N, avoid C,R,E, and place A and N in new positions.

Options:

- Place A at position 2 and N at position 1? Word like ""NASTY"": N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This avoids A at 3 and N at 4? Yes: A at position 2 (not 3) and N at 1 (not 4). Also includes S,T,Y which are common.

- Alternatively, ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But here A is at position 3 (which we know is incorrect) and N at position 4 (which we know is incorrect). So this would be bad because we know A isn't at 3 and N isn't at 4, so none would be in the correct position? We are using them but at positions that we already know are wrong.

Therefore, ""PLANT"" would waste the A and N positions? So better choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively.

So ""NASTY"" is a good candidate: N at 1, A at 2, and then S,T,Y.

We also haven't tested S,T,Y yet.

Another word: ""MANGO""? M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Positions: A is at 2 (not 3), N at 3 (we haven't tested N at 3). Also, avoids positions 3 and 4? Well, the A is at 2 (not the forbidden 3) and N at 3 (not the forbidden 4). So that's okay.

But ""MANGO"" has G and O.

Another: ""STAND"": S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). Oh, A at position 3? Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.

So back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.

Another good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn't at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn't put N at 4.

Thus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.

So let me avoid words with N at position 4.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don't have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.

We can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don't learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both?

But V is not very common? Or we don't know.

""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don't have to, but if we don't, we don't get information on N's position? So better to include since we have two known letters.

So words that have A and N:

- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.

List: 
- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible
- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible

Combinations:

We can try:

  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.

""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.

Words without C, R, E.

So ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.

But is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.

But ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.

Common letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tested them.

So I might prefer a word that includes S or T.

Back to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
- This covers S and T.

""NASTY"" seems good.

Another: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.

In fact, the rule doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

So to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn't show duplicates? Also, common strategy.

Thus ""PASTA"" has two A's? So not ideal.

""TASTY"" has two T's? Also not.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.

""PLANT"" same issue.

So ""NASTY"" seems solid.

Or ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.

""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).

In ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).

We know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.

But in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don't know about L? Yes.

But in NASTY: we have S and T.

Since S and T are among the most common, I'd go with ""NASTY"".

Also, if we try NASTY:

- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don't know? We're testing.

We are trying to get feedback on the positions.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:
- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.

Selected word: **NASTY**  
- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  
- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).",Guess 2: NASTY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,mania,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any previous feedback, so we need to pick a starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E. This covers several common letters.

 Since the rules require a valid 5-letter English word, ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Now, I'll make my first guess as ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all (x)
- R: not in the word at all (x)
- A: present in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in CRANE, but feedback is wrong position) (-)
- N: present in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE) (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the positions where they appeared are incorrect, but they could be anywhere else.

But note: the positions are relative to the guess. In CRANE:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: E

Feedback: A was marked as ""not in correct position"" meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

Also, we know C, R, E are ABSENT from the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have A somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5 possible for A? But not 3)
- Must have N somewhere (not position 4; positions 1,2,3,5 possible)

And the word does NOT contain: C, R, E.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to include A and N in different positions to pin down their locations, and also include other common letters.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: A and N. We also know C, R, E are out.

We should avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to put A in a position that isn't 3, and N in a position that isn't 4.

Possible structures:

Since A was in position 3 and was wrong, and N in position 4 was wrong, we can try moving A to position 1,2,4, or 5 and N to position 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know where exactly they should be.

Also, we need to cover other letters.

Idea: pick a word that has A and N in different positions, and uses other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words that contain A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Example: ""SANDY"" -> has S, A, N, D, Y.
But let's check positions: in SANDY, A is in position 2, N is in position 3. So we can test if A is at 2? But note A cannot be at 3? Wait, in CRANE A was at 3 and that was wrong. Now if we put A at 2, that's a different position.

But ""SANDY"" is valid.

Another: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. A is at 2, N at 4? But in CRANE, N was at 4 and that was wrong. So if we put N at 4 again, that would be invalid? Wait, no: maybe the word has an N, but not at position 4? So it could be at 4? No, because the feedback for N in CRANE at position 4 was wrong, meaning the N is not at position 4 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we should avoid placing the known letters in the positions that were already tried and failed? Yes.

Specifically:
- A cannot be at position 3 (because in CRANE it was at 3 and wrong).
- N cannot be at position 4 (because in CRANE it was at 4 and wrong).

In our next guess:
- Do not put A at position 3.
- Do not put N at position 4.

For SANDY: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y.
- Here, A is at 2 (which is new) and N is at 3 (which we haven't tested for N: previously N was at 4). So that's safe.

But PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
- A at 2: new
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4 from the first guess (since feedback was - meaning wrong position). So we must NOT put N at 4 again? Actually, we can put it at 4 to test? No, because if we put it at 4, we already know it's incorrect so we would waste a letter? But also, the feedback will tell us if it's there or not? But we know it's not there? So we are explicitly told that position 4 is not N? Exactly.

Therefore, we should avoid positions that we know are incorrect for a letter? Yes.

Since we know N is not at position 4, putting N at position 4 in a new guess would be unproductive because we already know it won't be correct. So we should try other positions.

Thus, for N: avoid position 4. We can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for A: avoid position 3 -> try 1,2,4,5.

Now, let me think of words that have A and N, avoid C,R,E, and place A and N in new positions.

Options:

- Place A at position 2 and N at position 1? Word like ""NASTY"": N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This avoids A at 3 and N at 4? Yes: A at position 2 (not 3) and N at 1 (not 4). Also includes S,T,Y which are common.

- Alternatively, ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But here A is at position 3 (which we know is incorrect) and N at position 4 (which we know is incorrect). So this would be bad because we know A isn't at 3 and N isn't at 4, so none would be in the correct position? We are using them but at positions that we already know are wrong.

Therefore, ""PLANT"" would waste the A and N positions? So better choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively.

So ""NASTY"" is a good candidate: N at 1, A at 2, and then S,T,Y.

We also haven't tested S,T,Y yet.

Another word: ""MANGO""? M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Positions: A is at 2 (not 3), N at 3 (we haven't tested N at 3). Also, avoids positions 3 and 4? Well, the A is at 2 (not the forbidden 3) and N at 3 (not the forbidden 4). So that's okay.

But ""MANGO"" has G and O.

Another: ""STAND"": S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). Oh, A at position 3? Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.

So back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.

Another good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn't at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn't put N at 4.

Thus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.

So let me avoid words with N at position 4.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don't have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.

We can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don't learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both? Actually, we can also try words that include one of them? But since both are present, we might as well try both to get their positions? Especially since we have limited guesses.

So ideally, use both A and N in new positions.

Next word: ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). Positions: A at 1 (not 3 -> good), N at 2 (not 4 -> good). And letters V, I, L.

But V is not very common? Or we don't know.

""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don't have to, but if we don't, we don't get information on N's position? So better to include since we have two known letters.

So words that have A and N:

- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.

List: 
- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible
- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible

Combinations:

We can try:

  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.

""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.

Words without C, R, E.

So ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.

But is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.

But ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.

Common letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tested them.

So I might prefer a word that includes S or T.

Back to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
- This covers S and T.

""NASTY"" seems good.

Another: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.

In fact, the rule doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

So to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn't show duplicates? Also, common strategy.

Thus ""PASTA"" has two A's? So not ideal.

""TASTY"" has two T's? Also not.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.

""PLANT"" same issue.

So ""NASTY"" seems solid.

Or ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.

""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).

In ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).

We know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.

But in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don't know about L? Yes.

But in NASTY: we have S and T.

Since S and T are among the most common, I'd go with ""NASTY"".

Also, if we try NASTY:

- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don't know? We're testing.

We are trying to get feedback on the positions.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:
- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.

Selected word: **NASTY**  
- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  
- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).

Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.\n\nSo back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.\n\nAnother good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn\'t at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn\'t put N at 4.\n\nThus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.\n\nSo let me avoid words with N at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don\'t have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.\n\nWe can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don\'t learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both? Actually, we can also try words that include one of them? But since both are present, we might as well try both to get their positions? Especially since we have limited guesses.\n\nSo ideally, use both A and N in new positions.\n\nNext word: ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). Positions: A at 1 (not 3 -> good), N at 2 (not 4 -> good). And letters V, I, L.\n\nBut V is not very common? Or we don\'t know.\n\n""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don\'t have to, but if we don\'t, we don\'t get information on N\'s position? So better to include since we have two known letters.\n\nSo words that have A and N:\n\n- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nList: \n- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible\n- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible\n\nCombinations:\n\nWe can try:\n\n  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.\n\n""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.\n\nWords without C, R, E.\n\nSo ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.\n\nBut is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.\n\nBut ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven\'t tested them.\n\nSo I might prefer a word that includes S or T.\n\nBack to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. \n- This covers S and T.\n\n""NASTY"" seems good.\n\nAnother: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.\n\nIn fact, the rule doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn\'t show duplicates? Also, common strategy.\n\nThus ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? So not ideal.\n\n""TASTY"" has two T\'s? Also not.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.\n\n""PLANT"" same issue.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" seems solid.\n\nOr ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.\n\n""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).\n\nIn ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).\n\nWe know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.\n\nBut in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don\'t know about L? Yes.\n\nBut in NASTY: we have S and T.\n\nSince S and T are among the most common, I\'d go with ""NASTY"".\n\nAlso, if we try NASTY:\n\n- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don\'t know? We\'re testing.\n\nWe are trying to get feedback on the positions.\n\nSo I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.\n- A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- N is present but not in position 4 (-).\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.\n\nSelected word: **NASTY**  \n- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  \n- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).\n\n<guess>NASTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: NASTY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: NASTY
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: correct position (✓) → so A is at position 2! (since in NASTY, A was at position 2 and it's correct)
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- Y: absent (x)

So now we know for sure:
- A is at position 2. (from the ✓ in NASTY)
- N is in the word, but not at position 1 (from NASTY) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions for N: 3 or 5? (since positions 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by A, so only 3 or 5 left? Actually, positions are 1 to 5, and position 2 is fixed as A, so N can be at 1,3,4,5 but we know it's not at 1 (from NASTY) and not at 4 (from CRANE). So only positions 3 or 5 are possible for N.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

And we have A fixed at position 2.

So the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And N must be at position 3 or 5.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ _ with N at 3 or 5, and without C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We also know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 (in CRANE) and that was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test where N is (position 3 or 5) and also test other common letters.

We have two cases: N at 3 or N at 5.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between these and also tests new letters.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We can try to include N in one of the possible positions and use common letters for the rest.

But we don't know if N is at 3 or 5, so we might choose a word that has N at one of them and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N? But that might not be efficient because we know N is in the word and we need to find its position.

So better to include N.

Let me think of words that have A at position 2 and N at position 3 or 5.

First, if N is at position 3: then the word is _ A N _ _

If N is at position 5: then the word is _ A _ _ N

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Also, we have to use valid English words.

Let me list possible words for each case? But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that tests one of the cases.

For example, if we choose a word with N at position 3, then:
- If the feedback shows N is correct at 3, then we know it's there.
- If it shows N is present but wrong position (if we put it at 3 but it's actually at 5), then we know N is at 5.

Similarly, if we put N at position 5, then:
- If correct, then N is at 5.
- If present but wrong position, then N must be at 3 (since position 1 is already ruled out and 4 is ruled out, and 2 is A).

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So we can try to cover both possibilities? Or choose one.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N at position 5 (for example) and then use common letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we can choose a word that has N at position 3.

But let's see which one gives more information.

I think either is fine.

Let me try to find words with A at 2 and N at 5: so pattern _ A _ _ N

Possible words: 
- MAN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5.
- WOMAN: W(1), O(2) but O at 2? But we need A at 2. WOMAN has O at 2, not A.
- Words: like ""PLAIN"": P(1), L(2) but L at 2? We need A at 2. So not.

Actually, the pattern is: position 1: any, position 2: A, position 3: any, position 4: any, position 5: N.

So: 
- Position 1: not C,R,E,S,T,Y, and not A (since A is at 2) and not N? N is at 5, so position 1 can be other letters.

Examples: 
- ""DAWNS"": but S is absent? We know S is absent, so no.
- ""FAUNA"": F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) -> but N is at 4? We need N at 5. Also, duplicate A? And N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at 4? So cannot be at 4.

We need N at 5.

""FAUNA"" has N at 4? Not 5.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list? From CRANE, R is absent. So cannot use R.

""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? And N at 3? But we are considering N at 5? This has N at 3.

For N at 5: 
- ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2) -> but A is at 1? We need A at 2. So not.
- ""CHAIN"": C(1) -> C is absent, and A at 2? H(2)? No, CHAIN: C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> A at 3? Not 2.

We need A at position 2.

So: position 2 is fixed as A.

So for N at 5: words like:
- ""PLAZA"": P(1), L(2) -> L at 2? But we need A at 2. PLAZA: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

Hard to find? Let me think.

""KAPPA"": K(1), A(2), P(3), P(4), A(5) -> duplicate A and P? But A at 2 and 5? And N? No N.

We need N at 5.

""MANGA"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> N at 3, not 5.

""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is absent? And no N.

""BAGGY"": no N.

Perhaps ""WOMAN"" is not, because O at 2.

Another: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3) -> not A at 2.

I'm struggling. Maybe N at 5 is rare? Or I'm missing words.

""OCEAN"": O(1), C(2) -> C absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""LOGAN"": L(1), O(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> A at 4? Not 2.

""DIANA"": D(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

Perhaps ""LANAI"": L(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), I(5) -> but N at 3, not 5.

I think it's easier to try N at position 3.

So pattern: _ A N _ _

Position 1: any letter not in absent list, position 2: A (fixed), position 3: N, position 4: any, position 5: any.

And avoid C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Examples:
- ""BANJO"": B(1), A(2), N(3), J(4), O(5) -> valid? BANJO is a word.
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> valid.
- ""FANCY"": F(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5) -> but C and Y are absent? C and Y are in absent list? From CRANE and NASTY, C and Y are absent. So no.
- ""DANDY"": D(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y absent, and duplicate D? But D is not tested? But Y is absent.
- ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in the secret word, we have A at position 2, and maybe another A? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid duplicates to prevent confusion? But it's allowed.

But let's see the absent letters: from NASTY, S,T,Y absent; from CRANE, C,R,E absent. So we cannot use C,R,E,S,T,Y.

So for ""BANJO"": B, A, N, J, O. None of these are in the absent list? B, J, O are new. So okay.

Similarly, ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. M,G,O are new.

""PANDA"": P, A, N, D, A. P and D are new, but duplicate A? If the secret word has only one A, then the second A in position 5 would be absent? But we don't know. So it might confuse.

Similarly, ""BANAL"": B(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), L(5) -> duplicate A.

So better to avoid duplicates? Since we don't know if duplicates exist.

Therefore, ""BANJO"" or ""MANGO"" are good.

""MANGO"" has M,G,O.

""BANJO"" has B,J,O.

J is less common? So ""MANGO"" might be better.

But we also need to consider that if N is not at position 3, then by putting N at 3, we might get feedback that N is present but wrong position, which would tell us that N must be at position 5.

So let's choose ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

If the feedback for N is ✓, then N is at position 3.

If the feedback for N is -, then N is not at 3, so it must be at 5.

Also, we get feedback on M, G, O.

We know A is fixed at 2, so that should be ✓.

So let's go with ""MANGO"".

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""WACKY"" but W(1), A(2), C(3) -> C absent.

No.

""VALID"": V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> but no N? We are not including N? But we want to test N's position.

In this case, if we don't include N, we won't get information on N? So better to include.

So ""MANGO"" seems fine.

""PANIC"": P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> C absent? C is in absent list? From CRANE, C is absent. So no.

So ""MANGO"" is good.

But let me confirm: M, A, N, G, O. All not in the absent list? Absent list: C,R,E,S,T,Y. So M,A,N,G,O are all allowed? A and N are in the word, but we are using them. M,G,O are new.

So I think ""MANGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MANGO"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.  
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: NASTY**  
  Feedback: N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong).  
  - A is **correct** at position 2 (✓).  
  - S, T, Y are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from NASTY's ✓).  
2. **N is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (ruled out by both guesses). Since position 2 is occupied by A, N must be in position 3 or 5.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must avoid these in future guesses).  
4. **Secret word structure**: `_ A _ _ _`  
   - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 2: A (fixed).  
   - Position 3: Could be N or another letter.  
   - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be N or another letter.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N's position**: Since N must be in position 3 or 5, we can use a word that places N in one of these positions to narrow it down:  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 and is correct (✓), then N is at position 3.  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 but marked wrong (-), then N must be at position 5 (as positions 1 and 4 are already ruled out).  
- **Cover new letters**: Use common unused consonants (e.g., M, G, O, L, D) to maximize information gain. Avoid duplicates and absent letters.  
- **Selected word: MANGO**  
  - M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)  
  - Why this word?  
    - A is at position 2 (fixed, so feedback will confirm it as ✓).  
    - N is at position 3 (tests if N is here or forces position 5 if wrong).  
    - M, G, O are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
    - No duplicates or absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, Y excluded).  
    - Valid 5-letter English word.  

<guess>MANGO</guess>",MANGO,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: NASTY
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: correct position (✓) → so A is at position 2! (since in NASTY, A was at position 2 and it's correct)
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- Y: absent (x)

So now we know for sure:
- A is at position 2. (from the ✓ in NASTY)
- N is in the word, but not at position 1 (from NASTY) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions for N: 3 or 5? (since positions 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by A, so only 3 or 5 left? Actually, positions are 1 to 5, and position 2 is fixed as A, so N can be at 1,3,4,5 but we know it's not at 1 (from NASTY) and not at 4 (from CRANE). So only positions 3 or 5 are possible for N.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

And we have A fixed at position 2.

So the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And N must be at position 3 or 5.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ _ with N at 3 or 5, and without C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We also know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 (in CRANE) and that was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test where N is (position 3 or 5) and also test other common letters.

We have two cases: N at 3 or N at 5.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between these and also tests new letters.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We can try to include N in one of the possible positions and use common letters for the rest.

But we don't know if N is at 3 or 5, so we might choose a word that has N at one of them and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N? But that might not be efficient because we know N is in the word and we need to find its position.

So better to include N.

Let me think of words that have A at position 2 and N at position 3 or 5.

First, if N is at position 3: then the word is _ A N _ _

If N is at position 5: then the word is _ A _ _ N

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Also, we have to use valid English words.

Let me list possible words for each case? But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that tests one of the cases.

For example, if we choose a word with N at position 3, then:
- If the feedback shows N is correct at 3, then we know it's there.
- If it shows N is present but wrong position (if we put it at 3 but it's actually at 5), then we know N is at 5.

Similarly, if we put N at position 5, then:
- If correct, then N is at 5.
- If present but wrong position, then N must be at 3 (since position 1 is already ruled out and 4 is ruled out, and 2 is A).

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So we can try to cover both possibilities? Or choose one.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N at position 5 (for example) and then use common letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we can choose a word that has N at position 3.

But let's see which one gives more information.

I think either is fine.

Let me try to find words with A at 2 and N at 5: so pattern _ A _ _ N

Possible words: 
- MAN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5.
- WOMAN: W(1), O(2) but O at 2? But we need A at 2. WOMAN has O at 2, not A.
- Words: like ""PLAIN"": P(1), L(2) but L at 2? We need A at 2. So not.

Actually, the pattern is: position 1: any, position 2: A, position 3: any, position 4: any, position 5: N.

So: 
- Position 1: not C,R,E,S,T,Y, and not A (since A is at 2) and not N? N is at 5, so position 1 can be other letters.

Examples: 
- ""DAWNS"": but S is absent? We know S is absent, so no.
- ""FAUNA"": F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) -> but N is at 4? We need N at 5. Also, duplicate A? And N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at 4? So cannot be at 4.

We need N at 5.

""FAUNA"" has N at 4? Not 5.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list? From CRANE, R is absent. So cannot use R.

""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? And N at 3? But we are considering N at 5? This has N at 3.

For N at 5: 
- ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2) -> but A is at 1? We need A at 2. So not.
- ""CHAIN"": C(1) -> C is absent, and A at 2? H(2)? No, CHAIN: C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> A at 3? Not 2.

We need A at position 2.

So: position 2 is fixed as A.

So for N at 5: words like:
- ""PLAZA"": P(1), L(2) -> L at 2? But we need A at 2. PLAZA: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

""KAPPA"": K(1), A(2), P(3), P(4), A(5) -> duplicate A and P? But A at 2 and 5? And N? No N.

We need N at 5.

""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is absent? And no N.

""BAGGY"": no N.

Perhaps ""WOMAN"" is not, because O at 2.

Another: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3) -> not A at 2.

I'm struggling. Maybe N at 5 is rare? Or I'm missing words.

""OCEAN"": O(1), C(2) -> C absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""LOGAN"": L(1), O(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> A at 4? Not 2.

""DIANA"": D(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

Perhaps ""LANAI"": L(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), I(5) -> but N at 3, not 5.

I think it's easier to try N at position 3.

So pattern: _ A N _ _

Position 1: any letter not in absent list, position 2: A (fixed), position 3: N, position 4: any, position 5: any.

And avoid C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Examples:
- ""BANJO"": B(1), A(2), N(3), J(4), O(5) -> valid? BANJO is a word.
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> valid.
- ""FANCY"": F(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5) -> but C and Y are absent? C and Y are in absent list? From CRANE and NASTY, C and Y are absent. So no.
- ""DANDY"": D(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y absent, and duplicate D? But D is not tested? But Y is absent.
- ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in the secret word, we have A at position 2, and maybe another A? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid duplicates to prevent confusion? But it's allowed.

But let's see the absent letters: from NASTY, S,T,Y absent; from CRANE, C,R,E absent. So we cannot use C,R,E,S,T,Y.

So for ""BANJO"": B, A, N, J, O. None of these are in the absent list? B, J, O are new. So okay.

Similarly, ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. M,G,O are new.

""PANDA"": P, A, N, D, A. P and D are new, but duplicate A? If the secret word has only one A, then the second A in position 5 would be absent? But we don't know. So it might confuse.

Similarly, ""BANAL"": B(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), L(5) -> duplicate A.

So better to avoid duplicates? Since we don't know if duplicates exist.

Therefore, ""BANJO"" or ""MANGO"" are good.

""MANGO"" has M,G,O.

""BANJO"" has B,J,O.

J is less common? So ""MANGO"" might be better.

But we also need to consider that if N is not at position 3, then by putting N at 3, we might get feedback that N is present but wrong position, which would tell us that N must be at position 5.

So let's choose ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

If the feedback for N is ✓, then N is at position 3.

If the feedback for N is -, then N is not at 3, so it must be at 5.

Also, we get feedback on M, G, O.

We know A is fixed at 2, so that should be ✓.

So let's go with ""MANGO"".

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""WACKY"" but W(1), A(2), C(3) -> C absent.

No.

""VALID"": V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> but no N? We are not including N? But we want to test N's position.

In this case, if we don't include N, we won't get information on N? So better to include.

So ""MANGO"" seems fine.

""PANIC"": P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> C absent? C is in absent list? From CRANE, C is absent. So no.

So ""MANGO"" is good.

But let me confirm: M, A, N, G, O. All not in the absent list? Absent list: C,R,E,S,T,Y. So M,A,N,G,O are all allowed? A and N are in the word, but we are using them. M,G,O are new.

So I think ""MANGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MANGO"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.  
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: NASTY**  
  Feedback: N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong).  
  - A is **correct** at position 2 (✓).  
  - S, T, Y are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from NASTY's ✓).  
2. **N is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (ruled out by both guesses). Since position 2 is occupied by A, N must be in position 3 or 5.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must avoid these in future guesses).  
4. **Secret word structure**: `_ A _ _ _`  
   - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 2: A (fixed).  
   - Position 3: Could be N or another letter.  
   - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be N or another letter.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N's position**: Since N must be in position 3 or 5, we can use a word that places N in one of these positions to narrow it down:  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 and is correct (✓), then N is at position 3.  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 but marked wrong (-), then N must be at position 5 (as positions 1 and 4 are already ruled out).  
- **Cover new letters**: Use common unused consonants (e.g., M, G, O, L, D) to maximize information gain. Avoid duplicates and absent letters.  
- **Selected word: MANGO**  
  - M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)  
  - Why this word?  
    - A is at position 2 (fixed, so feedback will confirm it as ✓).  
    - N is at position 3 (tests if N is here or forces position 5 if wrong).  
    - M, G, O are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
    - No duplicates or absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, Y excluded).  
    - Valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) G(x) O(x),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any previous feedback, so we need to pick a starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to cover more ground.

 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 I recall that ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E. This covers several common letters.

 Since the rules require a valid 5-letter English word, ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Now, I'll make my first guess as ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)

Interpretation:
- C: not in the word at all (x)
- R: not in the word at all (x)
- A: present in the word, but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in CRANE, but feedback is wrong position) (-)
- N: present in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE) (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the positions where they appeared are incorrect, but they could be anywhere else.

But note: the positions are relative to the guess. In CRANE:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: N
  Position 5: E

Feedback: A was marked as ""not in correct position"" meaning it's in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.

Also, we know C, R, E are ABSENT from the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have A somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5 possible for A? But not 3)
- Must have N somewhere (not position 4; positions 1,2,3,5 possible)

And the word does NOT contain: C, R, E.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to include A and N in different positions to pin down their locations, and also include other common letters.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: A and N. We also know C, R, E are out.

We should avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to put A in a position that isn't 3, and N in a position that isn't 4.

Possible structures:

Since A was in position 3 and was wrong, and N in position 4 was wrong, we can try moving A to position 1,2,4, or 5 and N to position 1,2,3, or 5.

But we don't know where exactly they should be.

Also, we need to cover other letters.

Idea: pick a word that has A and N in different positions, and uses other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, D, I, O, etc.

Let me think of words that contain A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Example: ""SANDY"" -> has S, A, N, D, Y.
But let's check positions: in SANDY, A is in position 2, N is in position 3. So we can test if A is at 2? But note A cannot be at 3? Wait, in CRANE A was at 3 and that was wrong. Now if we put A at 2, that's a different position.

But ""SANDY"" is valid.

Another: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. A is at 2, N at 4? But in CRANE, N was at 4 and that was wrong. So if we put N at 4 again, that would be invalid? Wait, no: maybe the word has an N, but not at position 4? So it could be at 4? No, because the feedback for N in CRANE at position 4 was wrong, meaning the N is not at position 4 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we should avoid placing the known letters in the positions that were already tried and failed? Yes.

Specifically:
- A cannot be at position 3 (because in CRANE it was at 3 and wrong).
- N cannot be at position 4 (because in CRANE it was at 4 and wrong).

In our next guess:
- Do not put A at position 3.
- Do not put N at position 4.

For SANDY: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y.
- Here, A is at 2 (which is new) and N is at 3 (which we haven't tested for N: previously N was at 4). So that's safe.

But PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
- A at 2: new
- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4 from the first guess (since feedback was - meaning wrong position). So we must NOT put N at 4 again? Actually, we can put it at 4 to test? No, because if we put it at 4, we already know it's incorrect so we would waste a letter? But also, the feedback will tell us if it's there or not? But we know it's not there? So we are explicitly told that position 4 is not N? Exactly.

Therefore, we should avoid positions that we know are incorrect for a letter? Yes.

Since we know N is not at position 4, putting N at position 4 in a new guess would be unproductive because we already know it won't be correct. So we should try other positions.

Thus, for N: avoid position 4. We can try positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly for A: avoid position 3 -> try 1,2,4,5.

Now, let me think of words that have A and N, avoid C,R,E, and place A and N in new positions.

Options:

- Place A at position 2 and N at position 1? Word like ""NASTY"": N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This avoids A at 3 and N at 4? Yes: A at position 2 (not 3) and N at 1 (not 4). Also includes S,T,Y which are common.

- Alternatively, ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But here A is at position 3 (which we know is incorrect) and N at position 4 (which we know is incorrect). So this would be bad because we know A isn't at 3 and N isn't at 4, so none would be in the correct position? We are using them but at positions that we already know are wrong.

Therefore, ""PLANT"" would waste the A and N positions? So better choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively.

So ""NASTY"" is a good candidate: N at 1, A at 2, and then S,T,Y.

We also haven't tested S,T,Y yet.

Another word: ""MANGO""? M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Positions: A is at 2 (not 3), N at 3 (we haven't tested N at 3). Also, avoids positions 3 and 4? Well, the A is at 2 (not the forbidden 3) and N at 3 (not the forbidden 4). So that's okay.

But ""MANGO"" has G and O.

Another: ""STAND"": S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). Oh, A at position 3? Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.

So back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.

Another good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn't at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn't put N at 4.

Thus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.

So let me avoid words with N at position 4.

Another word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don't have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.

We can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don't learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both? Actually, we can also try words that include one of them? But since both are present, we might as well try both to get their positions? Especially since we have limited guesses.

So ideally, use both A and N in new positions.

Next word: ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). Positions: A at 1 (not 3 -> good), N at 2 (not 4 -> good). And letters V, I, L.

But V is not very common? Or we don't know.

""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don't have to, but if we don't, we don't get information on N's position? So better to include since we have two known letters.

So words that have A and N:

- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.

List: 
- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible
- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible

Combinations:

We can try:

  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.

""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.

Words without C, R, E.

So ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.

But is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.

But ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.

Common letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven't tested them.

So I might prefer a word that includes S or T.

Back to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. 
- This covers S and T.

""NASTY"" seems good.

Another: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don't know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.

In fact, the rule doesn't say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

So to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn't show duplicates? Also, common strategy.

Thus ""PASTA"" has two A's? So not ideal.

""TASTY"" has two T's? Also not.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.

""PLANT"" same issue.

So ""NASTY"" seems solid.

Or ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.

""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).

In ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).

We know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.

But in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don't know about L? Yes.

But in NASTY: we have S and T.

Since S and T are among the most common, I'd go with ""NASTY"".

Also, if we try NASTY:

- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don't know? We're testing.

We are trying to get feedback on the positions.

So I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:
- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.

Selected word: **NASTY**  
- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  
- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).

<guess>NASTY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: NASTY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: NASTY
- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: correct position (✓) → so A is at position 2! (since in NASTY, A was at position 2 and it's correct)
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- Y: absent (x)

So now we know for sure:
- A is at position 2. (from the ✓ in NASTY)
- N is in the word, but not at position 1 (from NASTY) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions for N: 3 or 5? (since positions 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by A, so only 3 or 5 left? Actually, positions are 1 to 5, and position 2 is fixed as A, so N can be at 1,3,4,5 but we know it's not at 1 (from NASTY) and not at 4 (from CRANE). So only positions 3 or 5 are possible for N.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

And we have A fixed at position 2.

So the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

And N must be at position 3 or 5.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ _ with N at 3 or 5, and without C,R,E,S,T,Y.

We also know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 (in CRANE) and that was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, so that's consistent.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test where N is (position 3 or 5) and also test other common letters.

We have two cases: N at 3 or N at 5.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between these and also tests new letters.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We can try to include N in one of the possible positions and use common letters for the rest.

But we don't know if N is at 3 or 5, so we might choose a word that has N at one of them and see the feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N? But that might not be efficient because we know N is in the word and we need to find its position.

So better to include N.

Let me think of words that have A at position 2 and N at position 3 or 5.

First, if N is at position 3: then the word is _ A N _ _

If N is at position 5: then the word is _ A _ _ N

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Also, we have to use valid English words.

Let me list possible words for each case? But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that tests one of the cases.

For example, if we choose a word with N at position 3, then:
- If the feedback shows N is correct at 3, then we know it's there.
- If it shows N is present but wrong position (if we put it at 3 but it's actually at 5), then we know N is at 5.

Similarly, if we put N at position 5, then:
- If correct, then N is at 5.
- If present but wrong position, then N must be at 3 (since position 1 is already ruled out and 4 is ruled out, and 2 is A).

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So we can try to cover both possibilities? Or choose one.

But we can also test other letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N at position 5 (for example) and then use common letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we can choose a word that has N at position 3.

But let's see which one gives more information.

I think either is fine.

Let me try to find words with A at 2 and N at 5: so pattern _ A _ _ N

Possible words: 
- MAN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5.
- WOMAN: W(1), O(2) but O at 2? But we need A at 2. WOMAN has O at 2, not A.
- Words: like ""PLAIN"": P(1), L(2) but L at 2? We need A at 2. So not.

Actually, the pattern is: position 1: any, position 2: A, position 3: any, position 4: any, position 5: N.

So: 
- Position 1: not C,R,E,S,T,Y, and not A (since A is at 2) and not N? N is at 5, so position 1 can be other letters.

Examples: 
- ""DAWNS"": but S is absent? We know S is absent, so no.
- ""FAUNA"": F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) -> but N is at 4? We need N at 5. Also, duplicate A? And N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at 4? So cannot be at 4.

We need N at 5.

""FAUNA"" has N at 4? Not 5.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list? From CRANE, R is absent. So cannot use R.

""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? And N at 3? But we are considering N at 5? This has N at 3.

For N at 5: 
- ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2) -> but A is at 1? We need A at 2. So not.
- ""CHAIN"": C(1) -> C is absent, and A at 2? H(2)? No, CHAIN: C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> A at 3? Not 2.

We need A at position 2.

So: position 2 is fixed as A.

So for N at 5: words like:
- ""PLAZA"": P(1), L(2) -> L at 2? But we need A at 2. PLAZA: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

Hard to find? Let me think.

""KAPPA"": K(1), A(2), P(3), P(4), A(5) -> duplicate A and P? But A at 2 and 5? And N? No N.

We need N at 5.

""MANGA"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> N at 3, not 5.

""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is absent? And no N.

""BAGGY"": no N.

Perhaps ""WOMAN"" is not, because O at 2.

Another: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3) -> not A at 2.

I'm struggling. Maybe N at 5 is rare? Or I'm missing words.

""OCEAN"": O(1), C(2) -> C absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R absent, and A at 3? Not 2.

""LOGAN"": L(1), O(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> A at 4? Not 2.

""DIANA"": D(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.

Perhaps ""LANAI"": L(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), I(5) -> but N at 3, not 5.

I think it's easier to try N at position 3.

So pattern: _ A N _ _

Position 1: any letter not in absent list, position 2: A (fixed), position 3: N, position 4: any, position 5: any.

And avoid C,R,E,S,T,Y.

Examples:
- ""BANJO"": B(1), A(2), N(3), J(4), O(5) -> valid? BANJO is a word.
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> valid.
- ""FANCY"": F(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5) -> but C and Y are absent? C and Y are in absent list? From CRANE and NASTY, C and Y are absent. So no.
- ""DANDY"": D(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y absent, and duplicate D? But D is not tested? But Y is absent.
- ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But in the secret word, we have A at position 2, and maybe another A? But we don't know. Also, we have to avoid duplicates to prevent confusion? But it's allowed.

But let's see the absent letters: from NASTY, S,T,Y absent; from CRANE, C,R,E absent. So we cannot use C,R,E,S,T,Y.

So for ""BANJO"": B, A, N, J, O. None of these are in the absent list? B, J, O are new. So okay.

Similarly, ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. M,G,O are new.

""PANDA"": P, A, N, D, A. P and D are new, but duplicate A? If the secret word has only one A, then the second A in position 5 would be absent? But we don't know. So it might confuse.

Similarly, ""BANAL"": B(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), L(5) -> duplicate A.

So better to avoid duplicates? Since we don't know if duplicates exist.

Therefore, ""BANJO"" or ""MANGO"" are good.

""MANGO"" has M,G,O.

""BANJO"" has B,J,O.

J is less common? So ""MANGO"" might be better.

But we also need to consider that if N is not at position 3, then by putting N at 3, we might get feedback that N is present but wrong position, which would tell us that N must be at position 5.

So let's choose ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)

If the feedback for N is ✓, then N is at position 3.

If the feedback for N is -, then N is not at 3, so it must be at 5.

Also, we get feedback on M, G, O.

We know A is fixed at 2, so that should be ✓.

So let's go with ""MANGO"".

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""WACKY"" but W(1), A(2), C(3) -> C absent.

No.

""VALID"": V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> but no N? We are not including N? But we want to test N's position.

In this case, if we don't include N, we won't get information on N? So better to include.

So ""MANGO"" seems fine.

""PANIC"": P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> C absent? C is in absent list? From CRANE, C is absent. So no.

So ""MANGO"" is good.

But let me confirm: M, A, N, G, O. All not in the absent list? Absent list: C,R,E,S,T,Y. So M,A,N,G,O are all allowed? A and N are in the word, but we are using them. M,G,O are new.

So I think ""MANGO"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MANGO"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.  
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: NASTY**  
  Feedback: N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong).  
  - A is **correct** at position 2 (✓).  
  - S, T, Y are **absent** from the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from NASTY's ✓).  
2. **N is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (ruled out by both guesses). Since position 2 is occupied by A, N must be in position 3 or 5.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must avoid these in future guesses).  
4. **Secret word structure**: `_ A _ _ _`  
   - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 2: A (fixed).  
   - Position 3: Could be N or another letter.  
   - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be N or another letter.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N's position**: Since N must be in position 3 or 5, we can use a word that places N in one of these positions to narrow it down:  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 and is correct (✓), then N is at position 3.  
  - If N is guessed at position 3 but marked wrong (-), then N must be at position 5 (as positions 1 and 4 are already ruled out).  
- **Cover new letters**: Use common unused consonants (e.g., M, G, O, L, D) to maximize information gain. Avoid duplicates and absent letters.  
- **Selected word: MANGO**  
  - M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)  
  - Why this word?  
    - A is at position 2 (fixed, so feedback will confirm it as ✓).  
    - N is at position 3 (tests if N is here or forces position 5 if wrong).  
    - M, G, O are new high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
    - No duplicates or absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, Y excluded).  
    - Valid 5-letter English word.

Actually, the positions where they appeared are incorrect, but they could be anywhere else.\n\nBut note: the positions are relative to the guess. In CRANE:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: R\n  Position 3: A\n  Position 4: N\n  Position 5: E\n\nFeedback: A was marked as ""not in correct position"" meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nAlso, we know C, R, E are ABSENT from the word.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Must have A somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5 possible for A? But not 3)\n- Must have N somewhere (not position 4; positions 1,2,3,5 possible)\n\nAnd the word does NOT contain: C, R, E.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess. We should try to include A and N in different positions to pin down their locations, and also include other common letters.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters, and we know two of them: A and N. We also know C, R, E are out.\n\nWe should avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.\n\nCommon consonants left: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to put A in a position that isn\'t 3, and N in a position that isn\'t 4.\n\nPossible structures:\n\nSince A was in position 3 and was wrong, and N in position 4 was wrong, we can try moving A to position 1,2,4, or 5 and N to position 1,2,3, or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know where exactly they should be.\n\nAlso, we need to cover other letters.\n\nIdea: pick a word that has A and N in different positions, and uses other common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, T, L, D, I, O, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that contain A and N and avoid C, R, E.\n\nExample: ""SANDY"" -> has S, A, N, D, Y.\nBut let\'s check positions: in SANDY, A is in position 2, N is in position 3. So we can test if A is at 2? But note A cannot be at 3? Wait, in CRANE A was at 3 and that was wrong. Now if we put A at 2, that\'s a different position.\n\nBut ""SANDY"" is valid.\n\nAnother: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. A is at 2, N at 4? But in CRANE, N was at 4 and that was wrong. So if we put N at 4 again, that would be invalid? Wait, no: maybe the word has an N, but not at position 4? So it could be at 4? No, because the feedback for N in CRANE at position 4 was wrong, meaning the N is not at position 4 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess we must avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, we should avoid placing the known letters in the positions that were already tried and failed? Yes.\n\nSpecifically:\n- A cannot be at position 3 (because in CRANE it was at 3 and wrong).\n- N cannot be at position 4 (because in CRANE it was at 4 and wrong).\n\nIn our next guess:\n- Do not put A at position 3.\n- Do not put N at position 4.\n\nFor SANDY: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:N, 4:D, 5:Y.\n- Here, A is at 2 (which is new) and N is at 3 (which we haven\'t tested for N: previously N was at 4). So that\'s safe.\n\nBut PAINT: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). \n- A at 2: new\n- N at 4: but we know N is not at position 4 from the first guess (since feedback was - meaning wrong position). So we must NOT put N at 4 again? Actually, we can put it at 4 to test? No, because if we put it at 4, we already know it\'s incorrect so we would waste a letter? But also, the feedback will tell us if it\'s there or not? But we know it\'s not there? So we are explicitly told that position 4 is not N? Exactly.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid positions that we know are incorrect for a letter? Yes.\n\nSince we know N is not at position 4, putting N at position 4 in a new guess would be unproductive because we already know it won\'t be correct. So we should try other positions.\n\nThus, for N: avoid position 4. We can try positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly for A: avoid position 3 -> try 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, let me think of words that have A and N, avoid C,R,E, and place A and N in new positions.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Place A at position 2 and N at position 1? Word like ""NASTY"": N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This avoids A at 3 and N at 4? Yes: A at position 2 (not 3) and N at 1 (not 4). Also includes S,T,Y which are common.\n\n- Alternatively, ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But here A is at position 3 (which we know is incorrect) and N at position 4 (which we know is incorrect). So this would be bad because we know A isn\'t at 3 and N isn\'t at 4, so none would be in the correct position? We are using them but at positions that we already know are wrong.\n\nTherefore, ""PLANT"" would waste the A and N positions? So better choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" is a good candidate: N at 1, A at 2, and then S,T,Y.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested S,T,Y yet.\n\nAnother word: ""MANGO""? M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5). Positions: A is at 2 (not 3), N at 3 (we haven\'t tested N at 3). Also, avoids positions 3 and 4? Well, the A is at 2 (not the forbidden 3) and N at 3 (not the forbidden 4). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut ""MANGO"" has G and O.\n\nAnother: ""STAND"": S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). Oh, A at position 3? Forbidden! We cannot put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So ""STAND"" has A at 3 -> bad.\n\nSo back to ""NASTY"": positions 1:N, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:Y. N at 1 (new), A at 2 (new, and not 3), S,T,Y also common.\n\nAnother good word: ""PAINT""? Earlier we saw PAINT has A at 2 (good) and N at 4 (bad). N at 4 is bad because we know N isn\'t at position 4? Wait, in PAINT, N is at 4? And we know N is not at position 4 in the secret word. So we shouldn\'t put N at 4.\n\nThus PAINT: N at 4 -> avoid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N at 4, same issue.\n\nSo let me avoid words with N at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"" but no N? We must include N? We don\'t have to include both? But we have two known letters: A and N. If we include both, we get more information? Yes.\n\nWe can choose to include only one? But if we include A and not N, we don\'t learn about N? We already know N is present? So we should use both? Actually, we can also try words that include one of them? But since both are present, we might as well try both to get their positions? Especially since we have limited guesses.\n\nSo ideally, use both A and N in new positions.\n\nNext word: ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). Positions: A at 1 (not 3 -> good), N at 2 (not 4 -> good). And letters V, I, L.\n\nBut V is not very common? Or we don\'t know.\n\n""ATTIC"": no N? So we must include N? We don\'t have to, but if we don\'t, we don\'t get information on N\'s position? So better to include since we have two known letters.\n\nSo words that have A and N:\n\n- With A not at 3 and N not at 4.\n\nList: \n- Positions for A: 1,2,4,5 possible\n- Positions for N: 1,2,3,5 possible\n\nCombinations:\n\nWe can try:\n\n  A at 1, N at 2: e.g., ""ANGST"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5)? N at 2? But G and S T.\n\n""ANGRY"": but R is already excluded? We know R is absent? CRANE had R and it was absent? So we cannot use R.\n\nWords without C, R, E.\n\nSo ""ANGST"": A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). Avoids A at 3? A at 1 -> good. N at 2 -> good, and not 4? N at 2, which is not 4 -> good. And includes G,S,T.\n\nBut is ""ANGST"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""ADMIN"": A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). Then N at position 5? Which is allowed. So A at 1, N at 5: both good positions.\n\nBut ""ADMIN"" uses D,M,I.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L are very common. We haven\'t tested them.\n\nSo I might prefer a word that includes S or T.\n\nBack to ""NASTY"": N at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. \n- This covers S and T.\n\n""NASTY"" seems good.\n\nAnother: ""PASTA""? But P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5)? Wait duplicate A? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? So avoid duplicates? Because feedback can be ambiguous.\n\nIn fact, the rule doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters? But we should avoid because if the word has only one A but we have two, then the second A might be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo to be safe, avoid duplicate letters? Since the first guess didn\'t show duplicates? Also, common strategy.\n\nThus ""PASTA"" has two A\'s? So not ideal.\n\n""TASTY"" has two T\'s? Also not.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But A at 3? Forbidden! And N at 4? Forbidden! So bad.\n\n""PLANT"" same issue.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" seems solid.\n\nOr ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5). N at 3? Which is new, and not 4 -> good. And L and Y? But L is common.\n\n""MANLY"" vs ""NASTY"": both have A at 2. But in ""MANLY"", N at 3 and L,Y. In ""NASTY"", N at 1, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? Wait positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5).\n\nIn ""MANLY"": M(1), A(2), N(3), L(4), Y(5).\n\nWe know N cannot be at position 4? But in MANLY, N is at position 3? Position 3 is new? So okay.\n\nBut in MANLY, we have L at 4? We don\'t know about L? Yes.\n\nBut in NASTY: we have S and T.\n\nSince S and T are among the most common, I\'d go with ""NASTY"".\n\nAlso, if we try NASTY:\n\n- If A is actually at position 2, we might get a ✓ for A? Similarly, if N is at position 1? But we don\'t know? We\'re testing.\n\nWe are trying to get feedback on the positions.\n\nSo I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""NASTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C, R, and E are absent (x) → Must avoid these letters in future guesses.\n- A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- N is present but not in position 4 (-).\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains A and N (which must be placed in new positions for testing), and excludes C, R, E. Key points for the next guess:\n- Avoid placing A at position 3 (test new positions: 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Avoid placing N at position 4 (test new positions: 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- Include other common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, D) to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid duplicate letters to reduce ambiguity, as the feedback may be unclear with repeats.\n\nSelected word: **NASTY**  \n- Placement: N at position 1 (new for N), A at position 2 (new and avoids position 3), S at position 3 (untested), T at position 4 (untested), Y at position 5 (untested).  \n- This tests A and N in new positions, covers high-frequency letters S and T, and avoids forbidden positions, duplicates, and excluded letters (C, R, E).\n\n<guess>NASTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: NASTY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present, wrong position (-) → so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 4\n- E: absent (x)\n\nGuess 2: NASTY\n- N: present, wrong position (-) → so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and it\'s wrong there)\n- A: correct position (✓) → so A is at position 2! (since in NASTY, A was at position 2 and it\'s correct)\n- S: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- Y: absent (x)\n\nSo now we know for sure:\n- A is at position 2. (from the ✓ in NASTY)\n- N is in the word, but not at position 1 (from NASTY) and not at position 4 (from CRANE). So possible positions for N: 3 or 5? (since positions 1 and 4 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by A, so only 3 or 5 left? Actually, positions are 1 to 5, and position 2 is fixed as A, so N can be at 1,3,4,5 but we know it\'s not at 1 (from NASTY) and not at 4 (from CRANE). So only positions 3 or 5 are possible for N.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, E, S, T, Y.\n\nAnd we have A fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd N must be at position 3 or 5.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: _ A _ _ _ with N at 3 or 5, and without C,R,E,S,T,Y.\n\nWe also know that in the first guess, A was at position 3 (in CRANE) and that was wrong, but now we know A is at position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to test where N is (position 3 or 5) and also test other common letters.\n\nWe have two cases: N at 3 or N at 5.\n\nWe can design a guess that helps us distinguish between these and also tests new letters.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.\n\nWe can try to include N in one of the possible positions and use common letters for the rest.\n\nBut we don\'t know if N is at 3 or 5, so we might choose a word that has N at one of them and see the feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have N? But that might not be efficient because we know N is in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nSo better to include N.\n\nLet me think of words that have A at position 2 and N at position 3 or 5.\n\nFirst, if N is at position 3: then the word is _ A N _ _\n\nIf N is at position 5: then the word is _ A _ _ N\n\nNow, we need to fill the blanks with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,Y.\n\nAlso, we have to use valid English words.\n\nLet me list possible words for each case? But we don\'t know which case, so we can choose a word that tests one of the cases.\n\nFor example, if we choose a word with N at position 3, then:\n- If the feedback shows N is correct at 3, then we know it\'s there.\n- If it shows N is present but wrong position (if we put it at 3 but it\'s actually at 5), then we know N is at 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put N at position 5, then:\n- If correct, then N is at 5.\n- If present but wrong position, then N must be at 3 (since position 1 is already ruled out and 4 is ruled out, and 2 is A).\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.\n\nSo we can try to cover both possibilities? Or choose one.\n\nBut we can also test other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has N at position 5 (for example) and then use common letters for the other positions.\n\nSimilarly, we can choose a word that has N at position 3.\n\nBut let\'s see which one gives more information.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet me try to find words with A at 2 and N at 5: so pattern _ A _ _ N\n\nPossible words: \n- MAN: but that\'s 3 letters? We need 5.\n- WOMAN: W(1), O(2) but O at 2? But we need A at 2. WOMAN has O at 2, not A.\n- Words: like ""PLAIN"": P(1), L(2) but L at 2? We need A at 2. So not.\n\nActually, the pattern is: position 1: any, position 2: A, position 3: any, position 4: any, position 5: N.\n\nSo: \n- Position 1: not C,R,E,S,T,Y, and not A (since A is at 2) and not N? N is at 5, so position 1 can be other letters.\n\nExamples: \n- ""DAWNS"": but S is absent? We know S is absent, so no.\n- ""FAUNA"": F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5) -> but N is at 4? We need N at 5. Also, duplicate A? And N at 4 is forbidden? We know N is not at 4? So cannot be at 4.\n\nWe need N at 5.\n\n""FAUNA"" has N at 4? Not 5.\n\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2), N(3), O(4), R(5) -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list? From CRANE, R is absent. So cannot use R.\n\n""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? And N at 3? But we are considering N at 5? This has N at 3.\n\nFor N at 5: \n- ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2) -> but A is at 1? We need A at 2. So not.\n- ""CHAIN"": C(1) -> C is absent, and A at 2? H(2)? No, CHAIN: C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> A at 3? Not 2.\n\nWe need A at position 2.\n\nSo: position 2 is fixed as A.\n\nSo for N at 5: words like:\n- ""PLAZA"": P(1), L(2) -> L at 2? But we need A at 2. PLAZA: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.\n\nHard to find? Let me think.\n\n""KAPPA"": K(1), A(2), P(3), P(4), A(5) -> duplicate A and P? But A at 2 and 5? And N? No N.\n\nWe need N at 5.\n\n""MANGA"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> N at 3, not 5.\n\n""BALMY"": B(1), A(2), L(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is absent? And no N.\n\n""BAGGY"": no N.\n\nPerhaps ""WOMAN"" is not, because O at 2.\n\nAnother: ""QUAKE"": Q(1), U(2), A(3) -> not A at 2.\n\nI\'m struggling. Maybe N at 5 is rare? Or I\'m missing words.\n\n""OCEAN"": O(1), C(2) -> C absent, and A at 3? Not 2.\n\n""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R absent, and A at 3? Not 2.\n\n""LOGAN"": L(1), O(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> A at 4? Not 2.\n\n""DIANA"": D(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), A(5) -> A at 3 and 5, not 2.\n\nPerhaps ""LANAI"": L(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), I(5) -> but N at 3, not 5.\n\nI think it\'s easier to try N at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: _ A N _ _\n\nPosition 1: any letter not in absent list, position 2: A (fixed), position 3: N, position 4: any, position 5: any.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,E,S,T,Y.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BANJO"": B(1), A(2), N(3), J(4), O(5) -> valid? BANJO is a word.\n- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5) -> valid.\n- ""FANCY"": F(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), Y(5) -> but C and Y are absent? C and Y are in absent list? From CRANE and NASTY, C and Y are absent. So no.\n- ""DANDY"": D(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y absent, and duplicate D? But D is not tested? But Y is absent.\n- ""PANDA"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> duplicate A? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated? But in the secret word, we have A at position 2, and maybe another A? But we don\'t know. Also, we have to avoid duplicates to prevent confusion? But it\'s allowed.\n\nBut let\'s see the absent letters: from NASTY, S,T,Y absent; from CRANE, C,R,E absent. So we cannot use C,R,E,S,T,Y.\n\nSo for ""BANJO"": B, A, N, J, O. None of these are in the absent list? B, J, O are new. So okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. M,G,O are new.\n\n""PANDA"": P, A, N, D, A. P and D are new, but duplicate A? If the secret word has only one A, then the second A in position 5 would be absent? But we don\'t know. So it might confuse.\n\nSimilarly, ""BANAL"": B(1), A(2), N(3), A(4), L(5) -> duplicate A.\n\nSo better to avoid duplicates? Since we don\'t know if duplicates exist.\n\nTherefore, ""BANJO"" or ""MANGO"" are good.\n\n""MANGO"" has M,G,O.\n\n""BANJO"" has B,J,O.\n\nJ is less common? So ""MANGO"" might be better.\n\nBut we also need to consider that if N is not at position 3, then by putting N at 3, we might get feedback that N is present but wrong position, which would tell us that N must be at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), O(5)\n\nIf the feedback for N is ✓, then N is at position 3.\n\nIf the feedback for N is -, then N is not at 3, so it must be at 5.\n\nAlso, we get feedback on M, G, O.\n\nWe know A is fixed at 2, so that should be ✓.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""MANGO"".\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""WACKY"" but W(1), A(2), C(3) -> C absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""VALID"": V(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), D(5) -> but no N? We are not including N? But we want to test N\'s position.\n\nIn this case, if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get information on N? So better to include.\n\nSo ""MANGO"" seems fine.\n\n""PANIC"": P(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5) -> C absent? C is in absent list? From CRANE, C is absent. So no.\n\nSo ""MANGO"" is good.\n\nBut let me confirm: M, A, N, G, O. All not in the absent list? Absent list: C,R,E,S,T,Y. So M,A,N,G,O are all allowed? A and N are in the word, but we are using them. M,G,O are new.\n\nSo I think ""MANGO"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""MANGO"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C, R, E are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - A is **present** but not in position 3.  \n  - N is **present** but not in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: NASTY**  \n  Feedback: N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is **present** but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked wrong).  \n  - A is **correct** at position 2 (✓).  \n  - S, T, Y are **absent** from the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **A is fixed at position 2** (from NASTY\'s ✓).  \n2. **N is present** but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (ruled out by both guesses). Since position 2 is occupied by A, N must be in position 3 or 5.  \n3. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must avoid these in future guesses).  \n4. **Secret word structure**: `_ A _ _ _`  \n   - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  \n   - Position 2: A (fixed).  \n   - Position 3: Could be N or another letter.  \n   - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, Y).  \n   - Position 5: Could be N or another letter.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test N\'s position**: Since N must be in position 3 or 5, we can use a word that places N in one of these positions to narrow it down:  \n  - If N is guessed at position 3 and is correct (✓), then N is at position 3.  \n  - If N is guessed at position 3 but marked wrong (-), then N must be at position 5 (as positions 1 and 4 are already ruled out).  \n- **Cover new letters**: Use common unused consonants (e.g., M, G, O, L, D) to maximize information gain.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation: 
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: NASTY -> N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)
Interpretation:
- N is present but not in position 1.
- A is correct at position 2.
- S, T, Y are absent.

Guess 3: MANGO -> M(✓), A(✓), N(✓), G(x), O(x)
Interpretation:
- M is correct at position 1? In MANGO: M at position 1, and feedback ✓, so M is at position 1.
- A is correct at position 2 (as before).
- N is correct at position 3? In MANGO: N at position 3, and feedback ✓, so N is at position 3.
- G is absent (x).
- O is absent (x).

So now we know:

- Position 1: M (from MANGO feedback: M(✓))
- Position 2: A (from previous and confirmed)
- Position 3: N (from MANGO feedback: N(✓))

Therefore, the secret word begins with ""MAN"" and we need the last two letters.

Also, we know the following letters are absent:
From previous guesses: C, R, E, S, T, Y, G, O.

And we know the word has exactly ""M"", ""A"", ""N"" at positions 1,2,3.

Now, we need to guess positions 4 and 5.

The word is ""MAN _ _""

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

Absent letters: C, E, G, O, R, S, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But must be valid English words.

Possible two-letter endings after ""MAN"" that are valid:

- ""MANLY"": L and Y, but Y is absent? Y is absent from NASTY? Yes, Y(x) -> absent. So cannot.

- ""MANIA"": I and A? But duplicate A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But positions: position 4: I, position 5: A. So if A is duplicated, it might be possible? But we have to avoid absent letters? A is not absent? But we already have A at position 2, so if we use A at position 5, it might be possible? But let's see feedback on MANIA? Actually, we need to guess.

But in our MANGO guess, we used G and O? But O is absent? So O is out.

Other possibilities:

- ""MANGA"": G and A? But G absent? From MANGO feedback, G(x) -> absent. So G cannot be used.

- ""MANGO"": O is absent? Not.

- ""MANOR"": O and R? R absent? From CRANE, R(x) -> absent, and O absent? So no.

- ""MANKY"": K and Y? Y absent? No.

- ""MANNA"": N and A? Duplicate N? Positions: if word is M A N N A? But position 4: N, position 5: A? But we have N at position 3? Feedback in CRANE showed N present but not position 4? Wait, now if we have N at position 4? But let's see.

In CRANE, we had N at position 4? And feedback was N(-) meaning present but wrong position? But if the secret word also has N at position 4? Then it should be correct? Contradiction?

In CRANE: N was in position 4, and feedback N(-) meaning wrong position? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we cannot have N at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, words with N at position 4 are invalid? So ""MANNA"" has N at position 4? Position 3 is N, position 4 is N? But position 4 letter must be different? Because the N at position 4 in secret word would be the same letter? But the position is different.

But in CRANE, we guessed N at position 4 and got N(-), meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, position 4 is not N.

So we cannot have N at position 4? So ""MANNA"" would be invalid because it would have N at position 4? But if the secret word has N only at position 3 and not at 4? But ""MANNA"" has two N's? It could have N at position 3 and position 4? But then when we guessed CRANE with N at position 4, we should have gotten different feedback? Wait.

Case: secret word has N at position 3 and position 4? Then in CRANE, we guessed N at position 4? But if there is another N at position 4, it should be ✓? But we got (-), which means it's present but not at that position? So that implies there is an N, but in secret word position 4 is not N? So even if there is another N? So if secret word has N at 3 and 4? Then in CRANE (positions:1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E), for position 4: N is in secret word and at correct position? But we got (-)? Contradiction? Therefore, secret word cannot have N at position 4? Exactly.

Therefore, position 4 cannot be N? So we cannot have a duplicate N? Or at least position 4 is not N? So N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""MANNA"" are invalid? Because they would require position 4 to be N? Which we know is not allowed? So we avoid.

Similarly, we must ensure position 4 is not N? So for positions 4 and 5: we need two different letters, not in absent list? And not N? Because if N were at position 4, it would have been marked as N(✓) in CRANE? But we got (-), meaning it's not there? So position 4 cannot be N? So N is at position 3 only? We know.

So position 4: cannot be N? And must be one of the remaining letters.

Similarly, position 5: can be anything? But not absent letters? And not N? Or can be N? We have N at position 3? So position 5 could be N? Duplicate? But is duplicate allowed? It could be? But we don't know? Plus, we already have N at position 3? So position 5 could be another N? But let's see why not? But in previous guesses we only know one N? But it might have another? However, in CRANE with N at position 4? We got N(-), meaning it's present but not at position 4? So if there were a duplicate N at position 4? Then it should have been ✓? But we got (-)? So no N at position 4? So duplicate is possible? But not at position 4? So position 5 could be N? It's possible? But with position 3 already N? Then for position 5: N is not tested? But from CRANE, we only had one N? So if position 5 is N? Then when we guessed CRANE with N at position 4? We should have gotten (-) because the other N is at position 3? And position 4 is not N? So it's consistent? But this doesn't tell us about position 5? So duplicate N is possible? Therefore, position 5 could be N? But let's proceed.

So back to possible endings: ""MAN _ _"", with positions 4 and 5 letters not in absent list: absent = C,E,G,O,R,S,T,Y.

And position 4 cannot be N? Because we know N is not at position 4? Wait, but in secret word? Position 4 is not N? As established? But position 4 might be any other letter.

List possible ""MAN"" words:

- ""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y -> but Y absent? And position 5 Y? Absent? No.

- ""MANIA"": M,A,N,I,A -> position 4: I, position 5: A. A is already used? But duplicate A? And A is present? But we don't know? Also, from CRANE, we had A(-) at position 3? But if position 5 is A? Then we might have another A? Possible.

- ""MANIC"": C? Absent? No.

- ""MANGA"": G absent? No.

- ""MANOR"": O and R absent? No.

- ""MANUS"": U and S? S absent? No.

- ""MANTA"": T absent? No.

- ""MANKY"": K and Y? Y absent? No.

- ""MANNA"": position 4: N? But cannot be N? And anyway? Absent? But position 4 cannot be N? And duplicate N? But at position 4? We know position 4 cannot be N? So invalid? So skip.

- ""MANSE"": S and E? Absent? No.

- ""MANED"": E and D? E absent? No.

Now, possible words with available letters:

Letters available: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (but some are less common)

Examples:

- ""MANIC"": I and C? C absent? No.

Perhaps ""MANIK"": not a word.

Another: ""MANUL"": not common? Or ""MANAT"" not word.

What about ""MAPLE"": P(4), L(5) but then positions: if word is ""MAPLE"", but we have position 3 as N? In ""MAPLE"", position 3 is P? But we know position 3 must be N? So incorrect structure? We need MAN? So the first three letters must be M,A,N? So it must be exactly ""M A N"" followed by two letters.

So words starting with MAN? That are 5 letters? I think I need a list? But from memory:

- ""MANIA"" - positions:1:M,2:A,3:N,4:I,5:A? Duplicate A? And A is allowed? But from previous, we haven't ruled out duplicate A? But in CRANE, we had A at position 3? Which was wrong? But if position 5 is A? That might be okay? But we don't know.

- ""MANLY"": but Y absent? No.

- ""MANES"": E and S? Absent? No.

- ""MANOR"": O and R? Absent? No.

- ""MANGO"": O? Absent? Not.

- ""MANJU"": not English.

Common ones: ""MANTY"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANDI"": not common.

""MANHO"": not word.

What about ""MANOR"" we had.

Another: ""MANNA"" is not allowed as position 4 N? So skip.

""MANSA"" not word? S absent.

""MANGA"" not.

Perhaps ""MANIA"" is the only common one? Or ""MANIC"".

But ""MANIC"": letters M,A,N,I,C? But C absent? So invalid.

""MANIF"": not word.

What about ""MANOR"" excluded.

""MANSE"" S and E absent.

Perhaps ""MANOR"" is out.

Let's think of others: ""MANAL""? Not word.

""MANLY"" excluded because Y absent.

So then, ""MANIA"" might be possible? With I and A?

But we have to guess? Let's list:

Possible words: ""MANIA"" (I and A), ""MANSA"" (S absent), ""MANTA"" (T absent), etc.

But ""MANIA"" seems possible? With positions: 4:I, 5:A.

But duplicate A? And A is at position 2? So I and A at 4 and 5.

Other word: ""MANKU""? Not English.

""MANET"": E and T absent? Not word.

Perhaps ""MANOR"" is out.

Another: ""MANOW""? Not word.

Let's consider: ""MANQUE""? Too long? Not 5.

Perhaps I missed ""MANLY"" but Y absent.

But we have nothing? Perhaps there are words like ""MANIL"" which is not standard.

Instead, consider: position 5 could be a letter that closes common words? Like ""MANLY"" is common but excluded.

Perhaps ""MANIC"" not? C absent.

Another: ""MANUF""? No.

Perhaps ""MANGE"" G and E? G and E absent? G is absent from MANGO feedback? G(x) -> absent? So no.

""MANIA"" might be the only common choice? Or ""MANOR"" excluded.

But ""MANIA"" has duplicate A? But let's see feedback: we don't know if duplicate is allowed? So we can test? But we have to guess.

Another word: ""MANED"" E absent? No.

Perhaps ""MANIS"" I and S? S absent? No.

So possible words: based on available letters? Letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

Word: ""MANIH"" not word.

""MANIK"" not.

""MANITO"" too long.

""MANLY"" excluded? Y absent.

What about ""MANUL"": U and L? Is ""MANUL"" English? Manul is a type of cat? But valid? Probably obscure.

But Wordle uses common words.

"" MANIA"" might be acceptable? So let's go with ""MANIA""? But to confirm letters: position 4: I, position 5: A.

We know A is not at position 3? But position 5 A is okay? And I is new? Not absent? Yes.

So guess ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)

But we are using A at position 5? Which might be duplicate? So feedback might show: position 2 A ✓, position 5 might be A? If duplicate, then position 5 A would be present but wrong position? Or absent? If only one A, it would be absent? But we have A at position 2 already? So for position 5, if no other A, it would be absent? If A is at position 5, then we have it there? But since A is also at position 2? It could be that.

But in our first guess CRANE, we had A at position 3? Wrong position? But that was one A? So if secret word has A at positions 2 and 5, then CRANE with A at 3 should have shown at least as present? But it was (-)? Meaning there is an A not at 3? So if there are two A's? Then it could be? But position 3 is not A? Which is consistent.

So it's possible? But now we don't have a better word? So let's guess ""MANIA"".

But are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MANID""? Not common.

""MANKY"" K and Y? Y absent? No.

"" MANNA"" excluded.

""MANSA"" S absent.

Perhaps ""MANGA"" excluded.

What about ""MANAS""? S absent? And duplicate A? But S absent.

No.

""MANGA"" G absent.

So I think ""MANIA"" is a valid English word? Meaning intense enthusiasm? So accepted.

Or perhaps ""MANLY"" but Y absent? We cannot.

Another idea: ""MAPLE"" has position 3 P? But we need position 3 N? So not.

So I think we have to go with ""MANIA"".

But let's think: from the structure, we have MAN + two letters? Ends with I and A? So MANIA.

But we have only one guess? Are we close? We have guesses left? We are on guess 4? We have 2 guesses left.

But if we guess MANIA and it's wrong? We lose? We have 6 tries? Currently 3 used? So guess 4,5,6 left? Three left? I think we can test.

But we don't have much to lose? We know it must be MAN + two letters? With available.

Another word: ""MANOR"" excluded? O and R absent? But O is absent? R absent? So no.

"" MANAT"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANDU"" not word.

""MANLI"" not.

""MANUS"" S absent? No.

So I think ""MANIA"" is a candidate.

Perhaps ""MANGO"" was the previous guess? We already guessed MANGO? And G and O false? Here.

Or word ""MANISH"" too long.

Perhaps ""MANNA"" is invalid? Position 4 cannot be N? So skip.

Another common word: ""MANGO"" we had? Not.

""MANHA"" not word.

""MANLI"" not.

I think we have to choose ""MANIA"".

But feedback from MANGO: we have the word  MAN? with 4 and 5 unknown? So we need to guess.

Perhaps there is ""MANLEY"" too long? Not.

""MANWY"" no.

So ""MANIA"" seems the only common possibility? But let's double-check.

List of English words starting with MAN? With 5 letters? Avoiding C,E,G,O,R,S,T,Y.

- MANIA: M,A,N,I,A — I and A

- MANKU? No

- MANLE? No

- MANKO? No

- MANIF? No

- MANQUE? 6 letters

- MANTY? Not word

Perhaps ""MANAT"" not, or ""MANED"" E absent.

""MANEL"" not common; ""MANUL"" obscure.

But perhaps Wordle accepts ""MANIA"" or ""MANLY"" but not available.

Another: ""MANSE"" S and E absent? No.

So I think for this simulation, we'll guess ""MANIA"".

But in position 5: A? And position 4: I.

We are not sure if duplicate A is allowed? But it's possible.

But let's see: if MANIA is not the word? What else? Perhaps ""MANLI"" no, or ""MANLY"" with Y absent? But we cannot use Y? So MANIA is the only option? Or ""MANOA"" with O? O absent.

O absent? From MANGO G(x) O(x) -> O absent? So no.

So ""MANIA"" is it.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MANIA"".

But to be thorough, let's consider if N can be at position 5? But in MANGO we got N at position 3 ✓, so N is at position 3? Fixed? So no, MAN + two letters? And position 3 N? So the word must start with MAN? So MANIA.

So guess ""MANIA"".

  - Positions 1-3 are fixed: ""MAN"".  
  - Needs two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
  **Absent letters**: C, E, G, O, R, S, T, Y (all ruled out from guesses 1-3).  
  **Available letters**: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - Position 4 cannot be N (ruled out by CRANE feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Find a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""MAN"".  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Positions 4 and 5 must use letters from the available list.  
  - No absent letters.  
  - Avoid positions where letters are known to be incorrect (e.g., N cannot be at position 4).  
- **Evaluation**:  
  Consider common English words fitting ""MAN _ _"":  
  - ""MANLY"" → Invalid (Y is absent).  
  - ""MANOR"" → Invalid (O and R are absent).  
  - ""MANGA"" → Invalid (G is absent).  
  - ""MANIA"" → Valid (uses I and A; A may be duplicated, but not ruled out).  
- **Selection**: ""MANIA"" fits:  
  - M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5).  
  - Tests if position 5 is A (potential duplicate) or if I is present at position 4.  
  - Provides feedback to confirm the full word with one guess remaining.  

<guess>MANIA</guess>",MANIA,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Interpretation: 
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: NASTY -> N(-), A(✓), S(x), T(x), Y(x)
Interpretation:
- N is present but not in position 1.
- A is correct at position 2.
- S, T, Y are absent.

Guess 3: MANGO -> M(✓), A(✓), N(✓), G(x), O(x)
Interpretation:
- M is correct at position 1? In MANGO: M at position 1, and feedback ✓, so M is at position 1.
- A is correct at position 2 (as before).
- N is correct at position 3? In MANGO: N at position 3, and feedback ✓, so N is at position 3.
- G is absent (x).
- O is absent (x).

So now we know:

- Position 1: M (from MANGO feedback: M(✓))
- Position 2: A (from previous and confirmed)
- Position 3: N (from MANGO feedback: N(✓))

Therefore, the secret word begins with ""MAN"" and we need the last two letters.

Also, we know the following letters are absent:
From previous guesses: C, R, E, S, T, Y, G, O.

And we know the word has exactly ""M"", ""A"", ""N"" at positions 1,2,3.

Now, we need to guess positions 4 and 5.

The word is ""MAN _ _""

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with two letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

Absent letters: C, E, G, O, R, S, T, Y.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But must be valid English words.

Possible two-letter endings after ""MAN"" that are valid:

- ""MANLY"": L and Y, but Y is absent? Y is absent from NASTY? Yes, Y(x) -> absent. So cannot.

- ""MANIA"": I and A? But duplicate A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But positions: position 4: I, position 5: A. So if A is duplicated, it might be possible? But we have to avoid absent letters? A is not absent? But we already have A at position 2, so if we use A at position 5, it might be possible? But let's see feedback on MANIA? Actually, we need to guess.

But in our MANGO guess, we used G and O? But O is absent? So O is out.

Other possibilities:

- ""MANGA"": G and A? But G absent? From MANGO feedback, G(x) -> absent. So G cannot be used.

- ""MANGO"": O is absent? Not.

- ""MANOR"": O and R? R absent? From CRANE, R(x) -> absent, and O absent? So no.

- ""MANKY"": K and Y? Y absent? No.

- ""MANNA"": N and A? Duplicate N? Positions: if word is M A N N A? But position 4: N, position 5: A? But we have N at position 3? Feedback in CRANE showed N present but not position 4? Wait, now if we have N at position 4? But let's see.

In CRANE, we had N at position 4? And feedback was N(-) meaning present but wrong position? But if the secret word also has N at position 4? Then it should be correct? Contradiction?

In CRANE: N was in position 4, and feedback N(-) meaning wrong position? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we cannot have N at position 4 in the secret word.

Therefore, words with N at position 4 are invalid? So ""MANNA"" has N at position 4? Position 3 is N, position 4 is N? But position 4 letter must be different? Because the N at position 4 in secret word would be the same letter? But the position is different.

But in CRANE, we guessed N at position 4 and got N(-), meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, position 4 is not N.

So we cannot have N at position 4? So ""MANNA"" would be invalid because it would have N at position 4? But if the secret word has N only at position 3 and not at 4? But ""MANNA"" has two N's? It could have N at position 3 and position 4? But then when we guessed CRANE with N at position 4, we should have gotten different feedback? Wait.

Case: secret word has N at position 3 and position 4? Then in CRANE, we guessed N at position 4? But if there is another N at position 4, it should be ✓? But we got (-), which means it's present but not at that position? So that implies there is an N, but in secret word position 4 is not N? So even if there is another N? So if secret word has N at 3 and 4? Then in CRANE (positions:1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E), for position 4: N is in secret word and at correct position? But we got (-)? Contradiction? Therefore, secret word cannot have N at position 4? Exactly.

Therefore, position 4 cannot be N? So we cannot have a duplicate N? Or at least position 4 is not N? So N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, words like ""MANNA"" are invalid? Because they would require position 4 to be N? Which we know is not allowed? So we avoid.

Similarly, we must ensure position 4 is not N? So for positions 4 and 5: we need two different letters, not in absent list? And not N? Because if N were at position 4, it would have been marked as N(✓) in CRANE? But we got (-), meaning it's not there? So position 4 cannot be N? So N is at position 3 only? We know.

So position 4: cannot be N? And must be one of the remaining letters.

Similarly, position 5: can be anything? But not absent letters? And not N? Or can be N? We have N at position 3? So position 5 could be N? Duplicate? But is duplicate allowed? It could be? But we don't know? Plus, we already have N at position 3? So position 5 could be another N? But let's see why not? But in previous guesses we only know one N? But it might have another? However, in CRANE with N at position 4? We got N(-), meaning it's present but not at position 4? So if there were a duplicate N at position 4? Then it should have been ✓? But we got (-)? So no N at position 4? So duplicate is possible? But not at position 4? So position 5 could be N? It's possible? But with position 3 already N? Then for position 5: N is not tested? But from CRANE, we only had one N? So if position 5 is N? Then when we guessed CRANE with N at position 4? We should have gotten (-) because the other N is at position 3? And position 4 is not N? So it's consistent? But this doesn't tell us about position 5? So duplicate N is possible? Therefore, position 5 could be N? But let's proceed.

So back to possible endings: ""MAN _ _"", with positions 4 and 5 letters not in absent list: absent = C,E,G,O,R,S,T,Y.

And position 4 cannot be N? Because we know N is not at position 4? Wait, but in secret word? Position 4 is not N? As established? But position 4 might be any other letter.

List possible ""MAN"" words:

- ""MANLY"": M,A,N,L,Y -> but Y absent? And position 5 Y? Absent? No.

- ""MANIA"": M,A,N,I,A -> position 4: I, position 5: A. A is already used? But duplicate A? And A is present? But we don't know? Also, from CRANE, we had A(-) at position 3? But if position 5 is A? Then we might have another A? Possible.

- ""MANIC"": C? Absent? No.

- ""MANGA"": G absent? No.

- ""MANOR"": O and R absent? No.

- ""MANUS"": U and S? S absent? No.

- ""MANTA"": T absent? No.

- ""MANKY"": K and Y? Y absent? No.

- ""MANNA"": position 4: N? But cannot be N? And anyway? Absent? But position 4 cannot be N? And duplicate N? But at position 4? We know position 4 cannot be N? So invalid? So skip.

- ""MANSE"": S and E? Absent? No.

- ""MANED"": E and D? E absent? No.

Now, possible words with available letters:

Letters available: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (but some are less common)

Examples:

- ""MANIC"": I and C? C absent? No.

Perhaps ""MANIK"": not a word.

Another: ""MANUL"": not common? Or ""MANAT"" not word.

What about ""MAPLE"": P(4), L(5) but then positions: if word is ""MAPLE"", but we have position 3 as N? In ""MAPLE"", position 3 is P? But we know position 3 must be N? So incorrect structure? We need MAN? So the first three letters must be M,A,N? So it must be exactly ""M A N"" followed by two letters.

So words starting with MAN? That are 5 letters? I think I need a list? But from memory:

- ""MANIA"" - positions:1:M,2:A,3:N,4:I,5:A? Duplicate A? And A is allowed? But from previous, we haven't ruled out duplicate A? But in CRANE, we had A at position 3? Which was wrong? But if position 5 is A? That might be okay? But we don't know.

- ""MANLY"": but Y absent? No.

- ""MANES"": E and S? Absent? No.

- ""MANOR"": O and R? Absent? No.

- ""MANGO"": O? Absent? Not.

- ""MANJU"": not English.

Common ones: ""MANTY"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANDI"": not common.

""MANHO"": not word.

What about ""MANOR"" we had.

Another: ""MANNA"" is not allowed as position 4 N? So skip.

""MANSA"" not word? S absent.

""MANGA"" not.

Perhaps ""MANIA"" is the only common one? Or ""MANIC"".

But ""MANIC"": letters M,A,N,I,C? But C absent? So invalid.

""MANIF"": not word.

What about ""MANOR"" excluded.

""MANSE"" S and E absent.

Perhaps ""MANOR"" is out.

Let's think of others: ""MANAL""? Not word.

""MANLY"" excluded because Y absent.

So then, ""MANIA"" might be possible? With I and A?

But we have to guess? Let's list:

Possible words: ""MANIA"" (I and A), ""MANSA"" (S absent), ""MANTA"" (T absent), etc.

But ""MANIA"" seems possible? With positions: 4:I, 5:A.

But duplicate A? And A is at position 2? So I and A at 4 and 5.

Other word: ""MANKU""? Not English.

""MANET"": E and T absent? Not word.

Perhaps ""MANOR"" is out.

Another: ""MANOW""? Not word.

Let's consider: ""MANQUE""? Too long? Not 5.

Perhaps I missed ""MANLY"" but Y absent.

But we have nothing? Perhaps there are words like ""MANIL"" which is not standard.

Instead, consider: position 5 could be a letter that closes common words? Like ""MANLY"" is common but excluded.

Perhaps ""MANIC"" not? C absent.

Another: ""MANUF""? No.

Perhaps ""MANGE"" G and E? G and E absent? G is absent from MANGO feedback? G(x) -> absent? So no.

""MANIA"" might be the only common choice? Or ""MANOR"" excluded.

But ""MANIA"" has duplicate A? But let's see feedback: we don't know if duplicate is allowed? So we can test? But we have to guess.

Another word: ""MANED"" E absent? No.

Perhaps ""MANIS"" I and S? S absent? No.

So possible words: based on available letters? Letters: B, D, F, H, I, K, L, P, U, V, W, etc.

Word: ""MANIH"" not word.

""MANIK"" not.

""MANITO"" too long.

""MANLY"" excluded? Y absent.

What about ""MANUL"": U and L? Is ""MANUL"" English? Manul is a type of cat? But valid? Probably obscure.

But Wordle uses common words.

"" MANIA"" might be acceptable? So let's go with ""MANIA""? But to confirm letters: position 4: I, position 5: A.

We know A is not at position 3? But position 5 A is okay? And I is new? Not absent? Yes.

So guess ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)

But we are using A at position 5? Which might be duplicate? So feedback might show: position 2 A ✓, position 5 might be A? If duplicate, then position 5 A would be present but wrong position? Or absent? If only one A, it would be absent? But we have A at position 2 already? So for position 5, if no other A, it would be absent? If A is at position 5, then we have it there? But since A is also at position 2? It could be that.

But in our first guess CRANE, we had A at position 3? Wrong position? But that was one A? So if secret word has A at positions 2 and 5, then CRANE with A at 3 should have shown at least as present? But it was (-)? Meaning there is an A not at 3? So if there are two A's? Then it could be? But position 3 is not A? Which is consistent.

So it's possible? But now we don't have a better word? So let's guess ""MANIA"".

But are there other possibilities?

Another word: ""MANID""? Not common.

""MANKY"" K and Y? Y absent? No.

"" MANNA"" excluded.

""MANSA"" S absent.

Perhaps ""MANGA"" excluded.

What about ""MANAS""? S absent? And duplicate A? But S absent.

No.

""MANGA"" G absent.

So I think ""MANIA"" is a valid English word? Meaning intense enthusiasm? So accepted.

Or perhaps ""MANLY"" but Y absent? We cannot.

Another idea: ""MAPLE"" has position 3 P? But we need position 3 N? So not.

So I think we have to go with ""MANIA"".

But let's think: from the structure, we have MAN + two letters? Ends with I and A? So MANIA.

But we have only one guess? Are we close? We have guesses left? We are on guess 4? We have 2 guesses left.

But if we guess MANIA and it's wrong? We lose? We have 6 tries? Currently 3 used? So guess 4,5,6 left? Three left? I think we can test.

But we don't have much to lose? We know it must be MAN + two letters? With available.

Another word: ""MANOR"" excluded? O and R absent? But O is absent? R absent? So no.

"" MANAT"" not word.

Perhaps ""MANDU"" not word.

""MANLI"" not.

""MANUS"" S absent? No.

So I think ""MANIA"" is a candidate.

Perhaps ""MANGO"" was the previous guess? We already guessed MANGO? And G and O false? Here.

Or word ""MANISH"" too long.

Perhaps ""MANNA"" is invalid? Position 4 cannot be N? So skip.

Another common word: ""MANGO"" we had? Not.

""MANHA"" not word.

""MANLI"" not.

I think we have to choose ""MANIA"".

But feedback from MANGO: we have the word  MAN? with 4 and 5 unknown? So we need to guess.

Perhaps there is ""MANLEY"" too long? Not.

""MANWY"" no.

So ""MANIA"" seems the only common possibility? But let's double-check.

List of English words starting with MAN? With 5 letters? Avoiding C,E,G,O,R,S,T,Y.

- MANIA: M,A,N,I,A — I and A

- MANKU? No

- MANLE? No

- MANKO? No

- MANIF? No

- MANQUE? 6 letters

- MANTY? Not word

Perhaps ""MANAT"" not, or ""MANED"" E absent.

""MANEL"" not common; ""MANUL"" obscure.

But perhaps Wordle accepts ""MANIA"" or ""MANLY"" but not available.

Another: ""MANSE"" S and E absent? No.

So I think for this simulation, we'll guess ""MANIA"".

But in position 5: A? And position 4: I.

We are not sure if duplicate A is allowed? But it's possible.

But let's see: if MANIA is not the word? What else? Perhaps ""MANLI"" no, or ""MANLY"" with Y absent? But we cannot use Y? So MANIA is the only option? Or ""MANOA"" with O? O absent.

O absent? From MANGO G(x) O(x) -> O absent? So no.

So ""MANIA"" is it.

Therefore, I'll guess ""MANIA"".

But to be thorough, let's consider if N can be at position 5? But in MANGO we got N at position 3 ✓, so N is at position 3? Fixed? So no, MAN + two letters? And position 3 N? So the word must start with MAN? So MANIA.

So guess ""MANIA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
