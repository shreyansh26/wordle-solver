We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are starting with the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x' meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N as well.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting something.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""TOILS"" but let's check if it uses any forbidden letters: T (allowed), O (allowed), I (allowed), L (allowed), S (allowed). But we don't know if these are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"" but that has O, U, and S.

 However, note that we have no information so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating some letters is ""PILOT"" but that has O and T.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's list some words without these letters:

 Options:
 - ""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> allowed.
 - ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters. The letters S, T, L, O are very common.

 Another option: ""SLIPT"" is not common. Let's stick to common words.

 We can try ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> allowed.

 But perhaps ""MOIST"" is better because it has more common letters.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" has less common letters.

 Considering the above, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T, which are common and we haven't tried them.

 So, let's go with ""moist"".

We have two sets of feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word. So we exclude these letters.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation:
- M, O, T are not in the word (x), so we can exclude them too.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Included letters: I and S.

Since I and S are in the word, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"". In ""moist"", I was the third letter and S was the fourth, so in the secret word, I is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4.

We have two confirmed letters: I and S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and S.
2. Does not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
3. The word must have I not in position 3, and S not in position 4 (from the feedback of ""moist"").

Additionally, we should consider other common letters that haven't been tested yet. The untested letters include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have two letters to include (I and S) and we need three more, and we have 6 tries, we should try to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English: Among the untested, L, U, D, H, P, Y are relatively common.

We need to form a word with I and S, avoiding the excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words with I and S:

- We might think of words like ""SPLIT"", but S is in position 1 and I in position 4? However, we must avoid the letter L? Wait, L hasn't been excluded, so it's allowed. But let's check:
  - S: would be in position 1 -> allowed? We don't know if S can be in position 1 because in ""moist"" S was in position 4 and was wrong. But it might be in position 1.
  - However, ""split"" has P and L and T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""SKILL"" has S and I? But ""skill"" has two L's and no I? Actually, ""skill"" has I? No: S-K-I-L-L? Wait, ""skill"" has I in position 3. But we must avoid T? T is excluded, but ""skill"" doesn't have T. However, ""skill"" has K and L, but also I is in position 3? We know that in the secret word, I cannot be in position 3 (from ""moist"" feedback: I is in the word but not in position 3). So in ""skill"", I is in position 3, so that position is invalid for I.

Therefore, we cannot use words with I in position 3.

Let me think of other words:

- How about ""SWISH""? That has W and H, but also S in position 1 and 5? But we only have one S? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary. Also, ""swish"" uses S twice? Not efficient for testing. And it has H.

But we can try words that place I and S in positions that are not forbidden and use new letters.

We need to avoid positions:
- For I: position 3 (from guess2) is forbidden.
- For S: position 4 (from guess2) is forbidden.

So S cannot be in position 4 and I cannot be in position 3.

What positions can they be in? Any of positions 1,2,3,4,5 except those specific ones? No: the feedback only forbids the specific positions they were guessed in. So:
- I can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).
- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Now, we must form a word that includes both I and S, and three new letters from the remaining allowed set.

Let me try to find such a word.

Options:
- ""SIGHT"": has S in position 1, I in position 2. Then G, H, T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)), so ""sight"" has T -> not allowed.
- ""SPIKE"": S in 1, P, I in 3? Wait, I in position 3: but position 3 is forbidden for I? So if we put I in position 3, it's not allowed because we know it can't be there. Also, K and E? E is excluded. So not valid.
- ""SLIPS"": S in 1, L, I in 3 -> I in position 3 is forbidden. Also, P and S -> S repeated? Not ideal.
- ""DIGS"": only 4 letters? Not 5.

We need 5-letter words.

How about ""QUIPS""? Q, U, I, P, S. Let's check:
- Letters: Q, U, I, P, S. All not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. So Q,U,I,P,S are allowed? Yes.
- Positions: 
  - Q in 1, U in 2, I in 3 -> but I cannot be in position 3. So this would put I in the forbidden position. So not allowed.

Alternatively, we can put I in a different position.

Consider a word that has I in position 2 and S in position 5? Or position 1 and 5? etc.

For example, ""DAISY"": 
- D, A? But A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)). So A cannot be used.

Another word: ""BUILT"": but has B, U, I, L, T? T is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""SPILT"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> I cannot be in 3. And T is excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""SHIP"": 4 letters.

Word: ""WISPY"": W, I, S, P, Y. 
- Positions: W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.
- Check positions: I is in position 2 -> allowed (not 3). S is in position 3 -> allowed (since forbidden only for position 4). 
- Letters: W, I, S, P, Y. All these are not excluded? Yes: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. W, I, S, P, Y are all allowed.
- The word ""wispy"" is a valid English word (meaning like thin and light).

So ""wispy"" seems to fit:
- Contains I and S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- I is not in position 3 (it's in 2) -> okay.
- S is not in position 4 (it's in 3) -> okay.

Moreover, it introduces three new letters: W, P, Y.

This seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""SPIKY"" but I is in position 3 -> forbidden? ""spiky"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> invalid because I cannot be in 3.

Or ""BLIPS"": B, L, I, P, S -> I in position 3? Yes -> invalid.

So ""wispy"" is one option.

After analyzing the feedback:  
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).  
- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed that **I** and **S** are in the secret word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively, while M, O, T are excluded.  

**Constraints for the next guess:**  
- Must include **I** and **S**.  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from ""moist"").  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from ""moist"").  
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.  
- Untested common letters prioritized: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.  

**Reasoning for ""wispy"":**  
- Contains **I** (position 2) and **S** (position 3), satisfying position restrictions.  
- Uses new letters W, P, Y to maximize information.  
- Valid 5-letter English word.  

<guess>wispy</guess>",wispy,"We have two sets of feedback:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word. So we exclude these letters.
- Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation:
- M, O, T are not in the word (x), so we can exclude them too.
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Included letters: I and S.

Since I and S are in the word, but not in the positions they appeared in ""moist"". In ""moist"", I was the third letter and S was the fourth, so in the secret word, I is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4.

We have two confirmed letters: I and S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and S.
2. Does not contain any of the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
3. The word must have I not in position 3, and S not in position 4 (from the feedback of ""moist"").

Additionally, we should consider other common letters that haven't been tested yet. The untested letters include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we have two letters to include (I and S) and we need three more, and we have 6 tries, we should try to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters in English: Among the untested, L, U, D, H, P, Y are relatively common.

We need to form a word with I and S, avoiding the excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words with I and S:

- We might think of words like ""SPLIT"", but S is in position 1 and I in position 4? However, we must avoid the letter L? Wait, L hasn't been excluded, so it's allowed. But let's check:
  - S: would be in position 1 -> allowed? We don't know if S can be in position 1 because in ""moist"" S was in position 4 and was wrong. But it might be in position 1.
  - However, ""split"" has P and L and T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So T cannot be used.

Similarly, ""SKILL"" has S and I? But ""skill"" has two L's and no I? Actually, ""skill"" has I? No: S-K-I-L-L? Wait, ""skill"" has I in position 3. But we must avoid T? T is excluded, but ""skill"" doesn't have T. However, ""skill"" has K and L, but also I is in position 3? We know that in the secret word, I cannot be in position 3 (from ""moist"" feedback: I is in the word but not in position 3). So in ""skill"", I is in position 3, so that position is invalid for I.

Therefore, we cannot use words with I in position 3.

Let me think of other words:

- How about ""SWISH""? That has W and H, but also S in position 1 and 5? But we only have one S? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary. Also, ""swish"" uses S twice? Not efficient for testing. And it has H.

But we can try words that place I and S in positions that are not forbidden and use new letters.

We need to avoid positions:
- For I: position 3 (from guess2) is forbidden.
- For S: position 4 (from guess2) is forbidden.

So S cannot be in position 4 and I cannot be in position 3.

What positions can they be in? Any of positions 1,2,3,4,5 except those specific ones? No: the feedback only forbids the specific positions they were guessed in. So:
- I can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).
- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

Now, we must form a word that includes both I and S, and three new letters from the remaining allowed set.

Let me try to find such a word.

Options:
- ""SIGHT"": has S in position 1, I in position 2. Then G, H, T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)), so ""sight"" has T -> not allowed.
- ""SPIKE"": S in 1, P, I in 3? Wait, I in position 3: but position 3 is forbidden for I? So if we put I in position 3, it's not allowed because we know it can't be there. Also, K and E? E is excluded. So not valid.
- ""SLIPS"": S in 1, L, I in 3 -> I in position 3 is forbidden. Also, P and S -> S repeated? Not ideal.
- ""DIGS"": only 4 letters? Not 5.

We need 5-letter words.

How about ""QUIPS""? Q, U, I, P, S. Let's check:
- Letters: Q, U, I, P, S. All not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. So Q,U,I,P,S are allowed? Yes.
- Positions: 
  - Q in 1, U in 2, I in 3 -> but I cannot be in position 3. So this would put I in the forbidden position. So not allowed.

Alternatively, we can put I in a different position.

Consider a word that has I in position 2 and S in position 5? Or position 1 and 5? etc.

For example, ""DAISY"": 
- D, A? But A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)). So A cannot be used.

Another word: ""BUILT"": but has B, U, I, L, T? T is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""SPILT"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> I cannot be in 3. And T is excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""SHIP"": 4 letters.

Word: ""WISPY"": W, I, S, P, Y. 
- Positions: W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.
- Check positions: I is in position 2 -> allowed (not 3). S is in position 3 -> allowed (since forbidden only for position 4). 
- Letters: W, I, S, P, Y. All these are not excluded? Yes: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. W, I, S, P, Y are all allowed.
- The word ""wispy"" is a valid English word (meaning like thin and light).

So ""wispy"" seems to fit:
- Contains I and S.
- Avoids all excluded letters.
- I is not in position 3 (it's in 2) -> okay.
- S is not in position 4 (it's in 3) -> okay.

Moreover, it introduces three new letters: W, P, Y.

This seems like a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""SPIKY"" but I is in position 3 -> forbidden? ""spiky"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> invalid because I cannot be in 3.

Or ""BLIPS"": B, L, I, P, S -> I in position 3? Yes -> invalid.

So ""wispy"" is one option.

Another word: ""DIPPING""? Too long.

What about ""QUICK""? Has C? Excluded? But C is excluded -> no.

Another word: ""JUMPS""? Has U, M? M is excluded -> from guess2: M(x). So not allowed.

I think ""wispy"" is a solid guess.

Therefore, our next guess will be ""wispy"".After analyzing the feedback:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,silky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting with the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x' meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N as well.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting something.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""TOILS"" but let's check if it uses any forbidden letters: T (allowed), O (allowed), I (allowed), L (allowed), S (allowed). But we don't know if these are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"" but that has O, U, and S.

 However, note that we have no information so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating some letters is ""PILOT"" but that has O and T.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's list some words without these letters:

 Options:
 - ""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> all allowed.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> allowed.
 - ""BUOYS"": B, U, O, Y, S -> allowed.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters. The letters S, T, L, O are very common.

 Another option: ""SLIPT"" is not common. Let's stick to common words.

 We can try ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H -> allowed.

 But perhaps ""MOIST"" is better because it has more common letters.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" has less common letters.

 Considering the above, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it uses M, O, I, S, T, which are common and we haven't tried them.

 So, let's go with ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters entirely to test new letters. 

Aim for common letters not yet tried:  
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants like S, T, L, M and vowels like O, I, U.  
- ""Moist"" fits well: uses M, O, I, S, T (all untested letters) and is a valid English word.  

This guess maximizes new letter coverage and may reveal critical clues about the secret word's structure.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Included letters: I and S.

T is excluded, but ""skill"" doesn't have T. However, ""skill"" has K and L, but also I is in position 3?

So S cannot be in position 4 and I cannot be in position 3.

What positions can they be in? Any of positions 1,2,3,4,5 except those specific ones? No: the feedback only forbids the specific positions they were guessed in. So:
- I can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).

Now, we must form a word that includes both I and S, and three new letters from the remaining allowed set.

The untested letters include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince we have two letters to include (I and S) and we need three more, and we have 6 tries, we should try to use as many new common letters as possible to get more information.\n\nCommon letters in English: Among the untested, L, U, D, H, P, Y are relatively common.\n\nWe need to form a word with I and S, avoiding the excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words with I and S:\n\n- We might think of words like ""SPLIT"", but S is in position 1 and I in position 4? However, we must avoid the letter L? Wait, L hasn\'t been excluded, so it\'s allowed. But let\'s check:\n  - S: would be in position 1 -> allowed? We don\'t know if S can be in position 1 because in ""moist"" S was in position 4 and was wrong. But it might be in position 1.\n  - However, ""split"" has P and L and T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So T cannot be used.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKILL"" has S and I? But ""skill"" has two L\'s and no I? Actually, ""skill"" has I? No: S-K-I-L-L? Wait, ""skill"" has I in position 3. But we must avoid T? T is excluded, but ""skill"" doesn\'t have T. However, ""skill"" has K and L, but also I is in position 3? We know that in the secret word, I cannot be in position 3 (from ""moist"" feedback: I is in the word but not in position 3). So in ""skill"", I is in position 3, so that position is invalid for I.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use words with I in position 3.\n\nLet me think of other words:\n\n- How about ""SWISH""? That has W and H, but also S in position 1 and 5? But we only have one S? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary. Also, ""swish"" uses S twice? Not efficient for testing. And it has H.\n\nBut we can try words that place I and S in positions that are not forbidden and use new letters.\n\nWe need to avoid positions:\n- For I: position 3 (from guess2) is forbidden.\n- For S: position 4 (from guess2) is forbidden.\n\nSo S cannot be in position 4 and I cannot be in position 3.\n\nWhat positions can they be in? Any of positions 1,2,3,4,5 except those specific ones? No: the feedback only forbids the specific positions they were guessed in. So:\n- I can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but not 3).\n- S can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\nNow, we must form a word that includes both I and S, and three new letters from the remaining allowed set.\n\nLet me try to find such a word.\n\nOptions:\n- ""SIGHT"": has S in position 1, I in position 2. Then G, H, T. But T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)), so ""sight"" has T -> not allowed.\n- ""SPIKE"": S in 1, P, I in 3? Wait, I in position 3: but position 3 is forbidden for I? So if we put I in position 3, it\'s not allowed because we know it can\'t be there. Also, K and E? E is excluded. So not valid.\n- ""SLIPS"": S in 1, L, I in 3 -> I in position 3 is forbidden. Also, P and S -> S repeated? Not ideal.\n- ""DIGS"": only 4 letters? Not 5.\n\nWe need 5-letter words.\n\nHow about ""QUIPS""? Q, U, I, P, S. Let\'s check:\n- Letters: Q, U, I, P, S. All not excluded? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. So Q,U,I,P,S are allowed? Yes.\n- Positions: \n  - Q in 1, U in 2, I in 3 -> but I cannot be in position 3. So this would put I in the forbidden position. So not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can put I in a different position.\n\nConsider a word that has I in position 2 and S in position 5? Or position 1 and 5? etc.\n\nFor example, ""DAISY"": \n- D, A? But A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)). So A cannot be used.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILT"": but has B, U, I, L, T? T is excluded -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""SPILT"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> I cannot be in 3. And T is excluded -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""SHIP"": 4 letters.\n\nWord: ""WISPY"": W, I, S, P, Y. \n- Positions: W in 1, I in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5.\n- Check positions: I is in position 2 -> allowed (not 3). S is in position 3 -> allowed (since forbidden only for position 4). \n- Letters: W, I, S, P, Y. All these are not excluded? Yes: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T. W, I, S, P, Y are all allowed.\n- The word ""wispy"" is a valid English word (meaning like thin and light).\n\nSo ""wispy"" seems to fit:\n- Contains I and S.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n- I is not in position 3 (it\'s in 2) -> okay.\n- S is not in position 4 (it\'s in 3) -> okay.\n\nMoreover, it introduces three new letters: W, P, Y.\n\nThis seems like a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SPIKY"" but I is in position 3 -> forbidden? ""spiky"": S in 1, P in 2, I in 3 -> invalid because I cannot be in 3.\n\nOr ""BLIPS"": B, L, I, P, S -> I in position 3? Yes -> invalid.\n\nSo ""wispy"" is one option.\n\nAnother word: ""DIPPING""? Too long.\n\nWhat about ""QUICK""? Has C? Excluded? But C is excluded -> no.\n\nAnother word: ""JUMPS""? Has U, M? M is excluded -> from guess2: M(x). So not allowed.\n\nI think ""wispy"" is a solid guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess will be ""wispy"".After analyzing the feedback:  \n- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).  \n- Guess 2 (""moist"") showed that **I** and **S** are in the secret word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively, while M, O, T are excluded.  \n\n**Constraints for the next guess:**  \n- Must include **I** and **S**.  \n- I cannot be in position 3 (from ""moist"").  \n- S cannot be in position 4 (from ""moist"").  \n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.  \n- Untested common letters prioritized: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.  \n\n**Reasoning for ""wispy"":**  \n- Contains **I** (position 2) and **S** (position 3), satisfying position restrictions.  \n- Uses new letters W, P, Y to maximize information.  \n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>wispy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: wispy -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all x's: so C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(-), T(x). Thus, M, O, T are NOT in the word. I is in the word but not in position 3. S is in the word but not in position 4.
3. ""wispy"" -> W(x), I(✓), S(-), P(x), Y(✓). This tells us:
   - W is not in the word (x).
   - I is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because ""wispy"" is W-I-S-P-Y, so position 2 is I and it is correct). So, in the secret word, position 2 is I.
   - S is in the word but in the WRONG position (so not in position 3). But note: S is already known to be in the word from guess2. Now we additionally know it's not in position 3 (from this feedback) because it was guessed in position 3 and got a minus.
   - P is not in the word (x).
   - Y is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5). So, position 5 is Y.

Summary of known information:

- Correct position letters:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 5: Y

- Known present letters (but position not fully known): S (known from guess2 and confirmed in guess3). Also, note that I and Y are already placed correctly.

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P (all marked x in any guess).

Furthermore, we have position constraints for S:
- From ""moist"": S is not in position 4.
- From ""wispy"": S is not in position 3.

Therefore, S can only be in position 1 or position 2? But position 2 is now I, so S cannot be in position 2 because that letter is I. Therefore, S must be in position 1? Because positions 3, 4, and 5 are taken or ruled out? Position 5 is Y and correct, so S must be in one of the positions not yet fixed? Let's map the positions:

We know:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- The word pattern so far: _ I _ _ Y

We know S is in the word and cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from feedback of ""moist"" and ""wispy"") and cannot be in position 2 (because that's I) or 5 (because that's Y). Therefore, the only possible position for S is position 1.

But wait: position 1 is still available. And no feedback has said anything about position 1 for S? We haven't guessed S in position 1 yet. But since S must be somewhere and the only position left is 1, it must be position 1. In other words, we can deduce that S is in position 1.

Is that correct? Let me think: the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Pos2: I (fixed)
- Pos5: Y (fixed)
- S must be in the word and not in pos3, not in pos4 (as per feedback). Then the only positions left are 1 and ... but also we haven't tested pos1? And since we know S is in the word and hasn't been placed in pos2,3,4,5? Wait: pos2 is taken by I, and we cannot have I and S both in pos2? Obviously. So S cannot be in pos2 because it's I. Similarly, pos5 is Y. So S must be in either pos1, pos3, or pos4? But we have feedback that it's not in pos3 or pos4. Therefore, the only possibility is pos1.

So, the secret word must start with S? Then the word is: S I _ _ Y

Now, we need to fill positions 3 and 4. And we know that these positions must be filled with letters that are not excluded and we don't know them yet.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P.

We have used letters: in guesses we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,W,I,S,P,Y. So we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, X, Z. And possibly some others.

But note: the secret word must have only letters that are not excluded. So the two missing letters must be from the set of letters not excluded and not yet known.

We must form guesses that are English words of the form: S I ? ? Y

Where ? cannot be any of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,W,P) and also cannot be I or Y? Actually, I and Y are already used, but they could repeat? However, we don't have any information about duplicates. But since we haven't seen duplicates yet, it's safer to assume no duplicates until proven.

Therefore, we should choose two letters from the remaining set to fill the blanks.

Possible words: 
- We need to think of 5-letter words starting with ""SI"" and ending with ""Y"". 

Common ones: 
- ""SILLY"": has L and L? So letters: S, I, L, L, Y. But is L excluded? No. But we have two L's? 
   But note: we have two blanks? Actually, positions 3 and 4. But if we put two L's? Then word: S I L L Y -> that would be ""silly"". 
   Now, check if allowed letters: L is not excluded. And no duplicates? But we are guessing it. 
- ""SINEWY"": but N and E are excluded -> invalid.
- ""SIDEY"": but not a common word? And has D and E? E excluded.
- ""SILKY"": S,I,L,K,Y -> L in position 3, K in position 4. This seems valid? 
- ""SICKY"": not a word? And K is not excluded? But ""sicky"" isn't standard.

Other options: 
- ""SIGLY"": not a word.
- ""SIFTY"": not standard.
- ""SIMBY"": no.

Let me list valid words: 
- SILLY: S,I,L,L,Y -> but we haven't tested L? And it has a double L? 
- SILKY: S,I,L,K,Y -> uses L and K.
- SIPSY: not a word? and P excluded.
- SIXTH: has T and H? T is excluded -> invalid.
- SITBY: not a word.

Another word: ""SIMMY"": but M is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""BIGSY"": not pattern.

Given the pattern S I _ _ Y, we can look for words:

- ""SIDLE"" has D,L,E? E excluded -> invalid.
- ""SILTY"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""SILVA"": isn't common? and V? But also A excluded? A is excluded -> invalid.

Back to: ""silly"" and ""silky"" seem like the most common.

But we need to consider: we haven't tested L or K? So we could get information.

Moreover, ""SILLY"" would have two L's? That might be possible? But note that we don't have information about duplicate letters. We can try ""SILLY"" but it uses L twice? That makes it harder to test letters? Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to maximize information.

For example, ""SILKY"" uses L and K: two new letters.

But note: we have three letters known: S,I,Y and two unknown. So we need to guess the two unknowns.

But we only have two unknowns: positions 3 and 4 are unknown? So we are guessing the entire word?

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern? We have 3 more guesses? But why not try to win?

We know the word must be of the form S I _ _ Y.

But we don't know the third and fourth letters. We could try to enumerate:

Possible words: 
- ""SILKY""
- ""SILLY""
- ""SINEWY"": excluded letters -> invalid.
- ""SIDLE"": excluded -> invalid.
- ""SIZZY"": not common? Z?
- ""SIJLY"": not a word.

Another one: ""SIKHY"": not standard? H or K?

Perhaps: ""SILTS"": but T excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""SHIPY"": not a word? and H? But ""shipy"" doesn't exist.

More: ""WISPY"" we already tried? No.

Another: ""BITSY"": doesn't start with S? Not matching.

So the common ones are ""SILLY"" and ""SILKY"".

We could also consider other words? Like ""SICKY"" but not a word.

What about ""SINGY""? Has N and G -> N excluded? So no.

""SIKHS"": not ending with Y? and H? Doesn't work.

So it seems the possibilities are limited.

Given that, we can guess ""SILKY"" to test K and L? And if it's not that, then maybe ""SILLY""?

But let me double-check: Is there any other 5-letter word starting with SI and ending with Y? 

Using common letters, I can think of:
- ""SILKY""
- ""SILLY""
- ""SIFTY""? Not common.
- ""SIROC"": but doesn't end with Y.

Perhaps less common words? But we should stick to common English words.

Therefore, we can try one of these.

Given that we have two possibilities? Maybe choose one? Let's think of which to choose.

We also have to consider that we might have other letters? For instance, H and D? But in the pattern, words like ""SIDDY""? But ""siddy"" is not a word? Also D is allowed.

Another word: ""SIDHY""? Not standard.

I think ""SILKY"" and ""SILLY"" are the main ones.

To maximize information? But since we are guessing the whole word? We can win if we get it.

But note: we have only these two letters to fill? So actually we have two unknowns? So we can try ""SILKY"". If it's correct, we win? If not, then we know it must be ""SILLY"" because those are the only two common words?

So let's plan:

Guess 4: ""SILKY""

If it's correct: then done.

If not, then we know the last two letters? How? Well, if ""SILKY"" is wrong, then we get feedback showing what is correct. But actually, since we know S,I,Y are fixed, and we are guessing L and K? The feedback will tell us about positions 3 and 4.

But if we guess ""SILKY"", and the word is actually ""SILLY"", then:

Feedback:
- S: we know it's correct in position 1 -> ✓
- I: correct in position 2 -> ✓
- L: in position 3: in ""SILKY"" vs ""SILLY"": in both positions 3, so L would be correct? But in ""SILLY"" position 3 is L? So if the word is ""SILLY"", then ""SILKY"" would have: 
   - Position 1: S -> ✓ (correct)
   - Position 2: I -> ✓ (correct)
   - Position 3: L -> if the word has L? Yes -> and in position? It would be same -> ✓? But only if the word is ""SILLY"", then position 3 is L? But we don't know that.

Wait, if we guess ""SILKY"", and the secret word is ""SILLY"", then:

- S: position 1: same -> ✓
- I: position 2: same -> ✓
- L: position 3: same (because ""SILLY"" has L in pos3) -> ✓? Then also L is in the word and in the correct position? So ✓ for L?
- K: position 4: ""SILKY"" has K, but ""SILLY"" has L -> so K is not in the word? -> x
- Y: correct -> ✓

So feedback: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

If the word is ""SILKY"", then all ✓ and the K would be ✓? Wait: ""SILKY"" has K?

Actually, for ""SILKY"" if the secret is ""SILKY"": all ✓.

But if secret is ""SILLY"", then we get: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

And after that, we can guess ""SILLY"" easily.

Alternatively, we could guess ""SILLY"" first? Then similarly:

If we guess ""SILLY"" and the secret is ""SILLY"": all ✓.

If secret is ""SILKY"": then 
- S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L in fourth position? -> in ""SILKY"", the fourth letter is K? So L (fourth) would be minus? Not correct? Or x? Since the secret has K in fourth? So L is still in the word? Wait: 

Guess: S I L L Y
Secret: S I L K Y

So:
- Pos1: S ✓
- Pos2: I ✓
- Pos3: L ✓? Because both have L? But wait: only one L in the secret? Or does ""SILKY"" have only one L? So ""SILKY"" has L only in position 3? Then for the second L in the guess at position 4? It's not present? So:
- First L (pos3): ✓
- Second L (pos4): the secret does not have L in pos4, so it would be x? Because there is only one L? But it's in pos3 already? So the duplicate L would be incorrect.

Feedback might be tricky? Because ""SILLY"" has two L's? The secret ""SILKY"" has L only at position 3.

So for guess ""SILLY"" vs secret ""SILKY"":
- Pos1: S → ✓
- Pos2: I → ✓
- Pos3: L → ✓ (same)
- Pos4: L → but secret has K. Since there's only one L in secret? And it's already matched? So the second L is extra? Not present -> x? 
- Pos5: Y → ✓

So feedback: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

Thus, we can still know.

Now, we don't know if the word might be something else? But we have assumed it must be ""SILLY"" or ""SILKY"". Are there other possibilities?

What about words like ""SINHY""? Not standard.

Or ""SIHKY""? Not a word.

Or ""SHILY""? But we know position 1 is S? So ""shily"" would be S H I L Y? But that has H, and also I is in position 3? But in our pattern, we have fixed I at position 2? So cannot.

The word must be S I ? ? Y. So the third letter must be the first letter of the two blanks.

Another word: ""SIDHY""? Not common.

Or ""SIBBY""? Unlikely.

Perhaps ""SICKY""? Not a word.

Maybe ""SIZAR"": not Y.

I think ""SILKY"" and ""SILLY"" are the most probable.

We could use a word that might help us distinguish? Since we have one guess? We can try ""SIZES"" but that doesn't fit the pattern? And we know S,I,Y are fixed? So why not go for ""SILKY""? It introduces new letters K and L? Both needed for filling the blanks.

But note: if we guess ""SILKY"", and it's not correct, then the feedback will tell us about K and possibly something else? However, we might be able to guess in the next turn.

But to maximize our chance? We can also try a word like ""bulky"" to test B,U,L,K? But we don't know. But that might be inefficient? Because we know the pattern is S I _ _ Y.

Therefore, the best is to guess the word we think is most likely? Or test the letters? But since we know the pattern, we can guess one of the candidates.

Given that, I propose: ""SILKY"" because it tests two new letters? Or ""SILLY""? But either is fine.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that doesn't fit exactly but uses other letters? For example, we could guess a word that has a D or G? But why? We have two positions to fill? And if we guess a word that is not the pattern? We lose a guess? But we have 3 guesses left? Guess count: we are about to make guess4? So two more after? So we can try.

But note: We know positions 1 and 5? So we can focus on words that have the fixed letters? So it's more efficient to guess within the pattern.

But to test more letters? We can guess a word that has the same fixed letters? So we can try ""SKILLY""? Too long.

Another idea: guess ""KILLS"" to test K, I, L? But it doesn't start with S? Then we wouldn't get the position? And the pattern requires S in pos1? So it would waste hits?

Actually, we can know S and I and Y? So why not stick to the pattern.

Therefore, we'll guess ""SILKY"".

But wait: we also have the letter constraints? We haven't tested letters like B,D,F,G,H,J,U,V, etc.? But if we guess ""SILKY"", we get information about L and K? Then if it's wrong, we can guess ""SILLY"" next? Or if we have other possibilities?

But I think there are really only two common words? So we can do that.

But let me confirm the possibility: 

- We might have a word with H? For example, ""SIGHT"" -> but T excluded? And we know T is excluded? Also, ""sight"" doesn't end with Y? and we also know that position 5 is Y.

- Or ""SIJOS""? not standard.

I think we're safe.

Therefore, guess ""SILKY"".

If it's wrong, then we'll know: either the word is ""SILLY"" or a less common word? But ""SILLY"" is the other option.

So let's go with ""silky"".

One thing: in guess3, we had Y as correct? So the word ends with Y? And starts with S? With I in second? So yes.

So the guess is ""SILKY"".
</think>
After analyzing all feedback:  
- **Secret word structure**: Position 2 is I, position 5 is Y.  
- **S must be in position 1**:  
  - Confirmed in the word from Guess 2 (""moist"") and presence rules out positions 3/4 (per feedback).  
  - Only position 1 remains available, given fixed positions at 2 (I) and 5 (Y).  
- **Full pattern**: S I _ _ Y.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Fill positions 3 and 4 with untested, non-excluded letters. Common options: ""SILKY"" (L/K) or ""SILLY"" (L/L).  
- **Optimal guess**: ""SILKY"" tests two new distinct letters (L, K) and leverages common vocabulary. If incorrect, feedback will clarify positions 3–4 for next guess (e.g., ""SILLY"" if L appears).  

<guess>silky</guess>",silky,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all x's: so C, R, A, N, E are NOT in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(-), T(x). Thus, M, O, T are NOT in the word. I is in the word but not in position 3. S is in the word but not in position 4.
3. ""wispy"" -> W(x), I(✓), S(-), P(x), Y(✓). This tells us:
   - W is not in the word (x).
   - I is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2, because ""wispy"" is W-I-S-P-Y, so position 2 is I and it is correct). So, in the secret word, position 2 is I.
   - S is in the word but in the WRONG position (so not in position 3). But note: S is already known to be in the word from guess2. Now we additionally know it's not in position 3 (from this feedback) because it was guessed in position 3 and got a minus.
   - P is not in the word (x).
   - Y is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5). So, position 5 is Y.

Summary of known information:

- Correct position letters:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 5: Y

- Known present letters (but position not fully known): S (known from guess2 and confirmed in guess3). Also, note that I and Y are already placed correctly.

- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P (all marked x in any guess).

Furthermore, we have position constraints for S:
- From ""moist"": S is not in position 4.
- From ""wispy"": S is not in position 3.

Therefore, S can only be in position 1 or position 2? But position 2 is now I, so S cannot be in position 2 because that letter is I. Therefore, S must be in position 1? Because positions 3, 4, and 5 are taken or ruled out? Position 5 is Y and correct, so S must be in one of the positions not yet fixed? Let's map the positions:

We know:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- The word pattern so far: _ I _ _ Y

We know S is in the word and cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from feedback of ""moist"" and ""wispy"") and cannot be in position 2 (because that's I) or 5 (because that's Y). Therefore, the only possible position for S is position 1.

But wait: position 1 is still available. And no feedback has said anything about position 1 for S? We haven't guessed S in position 1 yet. But since S must be somewhere and the only position left is 1, it must be position 1. In other words, we can deduce that S is in position 1.

Is that correct? Let me think: the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Pos2: I (fixed)
- Pos5: Y (fixed)
- S must be in the word and not in pos3, not in pos4 (as per feedback). Then the only positions left are 1 and ... but also we haven't tested pos1? And since we know S is in the word and hasn't been placed in pos2,3,4,5? Wait: pos2 is taken by I, and we cannot have I and S both in pos2? Obviously. So S cannot be in pos2 because it's I. Similarly, pos5 is Y. So S must be in either pos1, pos3, or pos4? But we have feedback that it's not in pos3 or pos4. Therefore, the only possibility is pos1.

So, the secret word must start with S? Then the word is: S I _ _ Y

Now, we need to fill positions 3 and 4. And we know that these positions must be filled with letters that are not excluded and we don't know them yet.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P.

We have used letters: in guesses we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,W,I,S,P,Y. So we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, X, Z. And possibly some others.

But note: the secret word must have only letters that are not excluded. So the two missing letters must be from the set of letters not excluded and not yet known.

We must form guesses that are English words of the form: S I ? ? Y

Where ? cannot be any of the excluded letters (C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,W,P) and also cannot be I or Y? Actually, I and Y are already used, but they could repeat? However, we don't have any information about duplicates. But since we haven't seen duplicates yet, it's safer to assume no duplicates until proven.

Therefore, we should choose two letters from the remaining set to fill the blanks.

Possible words: 
- We need to think of 5-letter words starting with ""SI"" and ending with ""Y"". 

Common ones: 
- ""SILLY"": has L and L? So letters: S, I, L, L, Y. But is L excluded? No. But we have two L's? 
   But note: we have two blanks? Actually, positions 3 and 4. But if we put two L's? Then word: S I L L Y -> that would be ""silly"". 
   Now, check if allowed letters: L is not excluded. And no duplicates? But we are guessing it. 
- ""SINEWY"": but N and E are excluded -> invalid.
- ""SIDEY"": but not a common word? And has D and E? E excluded.
- ""SILKY"": S,I,L,K,Y -> L in position 3, K in position 4. This seems valid? 
- ""SICKY"": not a word? And K is not excluded? But ""sicky"" isn't standard.

Other options: 
- ""SIGLY"": not a word.
- ""SIFTY"": not standard.
- ""SIMBY"": no.

Let me list valid words: 
- SILLY: S,I,L,L,Y -> but we haven't tested L? And it has a double L? 
- SILKY: S,I,L,K,Y -> uses L and K.
- SIPSY: not a word? and P excluded.
- SIXTH: has T and H? T is excluded -> invalid.
- SITBY: not a word.

Another word: ""SIMMY"": but M is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""BIGSY"": not pattern.

Given the pattern S I _ _ Y, we can look for words:

- ""SIDLE"" has D,L,E? E excluded -> invalid.
- ""SILTY"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""SILVA"": isn't common? and V? But also A excluded? A is excluded -> invalid.

Back to: ""silly"" and ""silky"" seem like the most common.

But we need to consider: we haven't tested L or K? So we could get information.

Moreover, ""SILLY"" would have two L's? That might be possible? But note that we don't have information about duplicate letters. We can try ""SILLY"" but it uses L twice? That makes it harder to test letters? Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to maximize information.

For example, ""SILKY"" uses L and K: two new letters.

But note: we have three letters known: S,I,Y and two unknown. So we need to guess the two unknowns.

But we only have two unknowns: positions 3 and 4 are unknown? So we are guessing the entire word?

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't necessarily fit the pattern? We have 3 more guesses? But why not try to win?

We know the word must be of the form S I _ _ Y.

But we don't know the third and fourth letters. We could try to enumerate:

Possible words: 
- ""SILKY""
- ""SILLY""
- ""SINEWY"": excluded letters -> invalid.
- ""SIDLE"": excluded -> invalid.
- ""SIZZY"": not common? Z?
- ""SIJLY"": not a word.

Another one: ""SIKHY"": not standard? H or K?

Perhaps: ""SILTS"": but T excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""SHIPY"": not a word? and H? But ""shipy"" doesn't exist.

More: ""WISPY"" we already tried? No.

Another: ""BITSY"": doesn't start with S? Not matching.

So the common ones are ""SILLY"" and ""SILKY"".

We could also consider other words? Like ""SICKY"" but not a word.

What about ""SINGY""? Has N and G -> N excluded? So no.

""SIKHS"": not ending with Y? and H? Doesn't work.

So it seems the possibilities are limited.

Given that, we can guess ""SILKY"" to test K and L? And if it's not that, then maybe ""SILLY""?

But let me double-check: Is there any other 5-letter word starting with SI and ending with Y? 

Using common letters, I can think of:
- ""SILKY""
- ""SILLY""
- ""SIFTY""? Not common.
- ""SIROC"": but doesn't end with Y.

Perhaps less common words? But we should stick to common English words.

Therefore, we can try one of these.

Given that we have two possibilities? Maybe choose one? Let's think of which to choose.

We also have to consider that we might have other letters? For instance, H and D? But in the pattern, words like ""SIDDY""? But ""siddy"" is not a word? Also D is allowed.

Another word: ""SIDHY""? Not standard.

I think ""SILKY"" and ""SILLY"" are the main ones.

To maximize information? But since we are guessing the whole word? We can win if we get it.

But note: we have only these two letters to fill? So actually we have two unknowns? So we can try ""SILKY"". If it's correct, we win? If not, then we know it must be ""SILLY"" because those are the only two common words?

So let's plan:

Guess 4: ""SILKY""

If it's correct: then done.

If not, then we know the last two letters? How? Well, if ""SILKY"" is wrong, then we get feedback showing what is correct. But actually, since we know S,I,Y are fixed, and we are guessing L and K? The feedback will tell us about positions 3 and 4.

But if we guess ""SILKY"", and the word is actually ""SILLY"", then:

Feedback:
- S: we know it's correct in position 1 -> ✓
- I: correct in position 2 -> ✓
- L: in position 3: in ""SILKY"" vs ""SILLY"": in both positions 3, so L would be correct? But in ""SILLY"" position 3 is L? So if the word is ""SILLY"", then ""SILKY"" would have: 
   - Position 1: S -> ✓ (correct)
   - Position 2: I -> ✓ (correct)
   - Position 3: L -> if the word has L? Yes -> and in position? It would be same -> ✓? But only if the word is ""SILLY"", then position 3 is L? But we don't know that.

Wait, if we guess ""SILKY"", and the secret word is ""SILLY"", then:

- S: position 1: same -> ✓
- I: position 2: same -> ✓
- L: position 3: same (because ""SILLY"" has L in pos3) -> ✓? Then also L is in the word and in the correct position? So ✓ for L?
- K: position 4: ""SILKY"" has K, but ""SILLY"" has L -> so K is not in the word? -> x
- Y: correct -> ✓

So feedback: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

If the word is ""SILKY"", then all ✓ and the K would be ✓? Wait: ""SILKY"" has K?

Actually, for ""SILKY"" if the secret is ""SILKY"": all ✓.

But if secret is ""SILLY"", then we get: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

And after that, we can guess ""SILLY"" easily.

Alternatively, we could guess ""SILLY"" first? Then similarly:

If we guess ""SILLY"" and the secret is ""SILLY"": all ✓.

If secret is ""SILKY"": then 
- S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L in fourth position? -> in ""SILKY"", the fourth letter is K? So L (fourth) would be minus? Not correct? Or x? Since the secret has K in fourth? So L is still in the word? Wait: 

Guess: S I L L Y
Secret: S I L K Y

So:
- Pos1: S ✓
- Pos2: I ✓
- Pos3: L ✓? Because both have L? But wait: only one L in the secret? Or does ""SILKY"" have only one L? So ""SILKY"" has L only in position 3? Then for the second L in the guess at position 4? It's not present? So:
- First L (pos3): ✓
- Second L (pos4): the secret does not have L in pos4, so it would be x? Because there is only one L? But it's in pos3 already? So the duplicate L would be incorrect.

Feedback might be tricky? Because ""SILLY"" has two L's? The secret ""SILKY"" has L only at position 3.

So for guess ""SILLY"" vs secret ""SILKY"":
- Pos1: S → ✓
- Pos2: I → ✓
- Pos3: L → ✓ (same)
- Pos4: L → but secret has K. Since there's only one L in secret? And it's already matched? So the second L is extra? Not present -> x? 
- Pos5: Y → ✓

So feedback: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

Thus, we can still know.

Now, we don't know if the word might be something else? But we have assumed it must be ""SILLY"" or ""SILKY"". Are there other possibilities?

What about words like ""SINHY""? Not standard.

Or ""SIHKY""? Not a word.

Or ""SHILY""? But we know position 1 is S? So ""shily"" would be S H I L Y? But that has H, and also I is in position 3? But in our pattern, we have fixed I at position 2? So cannot.

The word must be S I ? ? Y. So the third letter must be the first letter of the two blanks.

Another word: ""SIDHY""? Not common.

Or ""SIBBY""? Unlikely.

Perhaps ""SICKY""? Not a word.

Maybe ""SIZAR"": not Y.

I think ""SILKY"" and ""SILLY"" are the most probable.

We could use a word that might help us distinguish? Since we have one guess? We can try ""SIZES"" but that doesn't fit the pattern? And we know S,I,Y are fixed? So why not go for ""SILKY""? It introduces new letters K and L? Both needed for filling the blanks.

But note: if we guess ""SILKY"", and it's not correct, then the feedback will tell us about K and possibly something else? However, we might be able to guess in the next turn.

But to maximize our chance? We can also try a word like ""bulky"" to test B,U,L,K? But we don't know. But that might be inefficient? Because we know the pattern is S I _ _ Y.

Therefore, the best is to guess the word we think is most likely? Or test the letters? But since we know the pattern, we can guess one of the candidates.

Given that, I propose: ""SILKY"" because it tests two new letters? Or ""SILLY""? But either is fine.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that doesn't fit exactly but uses other letters? For example, we could guess a word that has a D or G? But why? We have two positions to fill? And if we guess a word that is not the pattern? We lose a guess? But we have 3 guesses left? Guess count: we are about to make guess4? So two more after? So we can try.

But note: We know positions 1 and 5? So we can focus on words that have the fixed letters? So it's more efficient to guess within the pattern.

But to test more letters? We can guess a word that has the same fixed letters? So we can try ""SKILLY""? Too long.

Another idea: guess ""KILLS"" to test K, I, L? But it doesn't start with S? Then we wouldn't get the position? And the pattern requires S in pos1? So it would waste hits?

Actually, we can know S and I and Y? So why not stick to the pattern.

Therefore, we'll guess ""SILKY"".

But wait: we also have the letter constraints? We haven't tested letters like B,D,F,G,H,J,U,V, etc.? But if we guess ""SILKY"", we get information about L and K? Then if it's wrong, we can guess ""SILLY"" next? Or if we have other possibilities?

But I think there are really only two common words? So we can do that.

But let me confirm the possibility: 

- We might have a word with H? For example, ""SIGHT"" -> but T excluded? And we know T is excluded? Also, ""sight"" doesn't end with Y? and we also know that position 5 is Y.

- Or ""SIJOS""? not standard.

I think we're safe.

Therefore, guess ""SILKY"".

If it's wrong, then we'll know: either the word is ""SILLY"" or a less common word? But ""SILLY"" is the other option.

So let's go with ""silky"".

One thing: in guess3, we had Y as correct? So the word ends with Y? And starts with S? With I in second? So yes.

So the guess is ""SILKY"".After analyzing all feedback:  
- **Secret word structure**: Position 2 is I, position 5 is Y.  
- **S must be in position 1**:  
  - Confirmed in the word from Guess 2 (""moist"") and presence rules out positions 3/4 (per feedback).  
  - Only position 1 remains available, given fixed positions at 2 (I) and 5 (Y).  
- **Full pattern**: S I _ _ Y.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, W, P.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Fill positions 3 and 4 with untested, non-excluded letters. Common options: ""SILKY"" (L/K) or ""SILLY"" (L/L).  
- **Optimal guess**: ""SILKY"" tests two new distinct letters (L, K) and leverages common vocabulary. If incorrect, feedback will clarify positions 3–4 for next guess (e.g., ""SILLY"" if L appears).",Guess 4: silky -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) L(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
