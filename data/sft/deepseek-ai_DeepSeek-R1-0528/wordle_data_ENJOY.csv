We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.

I recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let's pick one that might be effective.

One suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, it contains the letter 'S' which is very common.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used as a starting word because it has a high frequency of common letters, but it may not be very common in everyday language. Another good one is ""SLATE"".

Since the instructions don't specify a word list, I'll pick a common word: ""CRANE"". 

Let me consider ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E: five distinct letters.
- Contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
- These letters are fairly common.

But note: the word ""CRANE"" might be more effective because it has a good mix. However, let me also think about ""SALET"", but that's less common.

Another option: ""RAISE"". Let's compare:
- R, A, I, S, E: three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). Very common letters.

According to various sources, ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word. However, to be systematic, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

But wait, I remember that in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a valid word and often used. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good.

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

After this guess, we'll get feedback that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

Therefore, I will output:
<guess> crane </guess>
</think>
In this first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include:

1. Common letters to increase hit probability
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. Unique letters (no repeats) to test more positions

Based on common Wordle strategies:
- Vowels: A, E are among the most frequent
- Consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C are common
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are statistically strong openers

I choose **CRANE** because:
- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique
- Covering 5/26 letters tests key parts of the word
- High-frequency letters may reveal positions early

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

We also know that the secret word must contain N and E, and they are not in the positions we guessed.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so this is our second try.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E (since they are in the word, but we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively).
- We should try to place N and E in different positions to find their correct locations.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since N and E are in the word, we can try to use them in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so N not in 4th, E not in 5th).

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we have to consider the positions.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We tried:
Position 1: C (x) -> not C, and also not the letter that is actually there? But we don't know what is there.
Similarly, we know that the letter in position 1 is not C, and also not R (because R was in position 2 and is absent) and not A (position 3 absent). But we don't know what is in position 1.

We have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.

We can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.

We also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We can try to put N and E in positions we haven't tested and also test other letters.

We also want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Some words: 
- ""lines"": but we don't know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.

But wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.

But we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That's allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that's allowed.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.

Alternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.

Another word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E's? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E's, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don't know about duplicates. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.

However, ""tense"" has two E's, so we might not get full information.

Another word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.

Therefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.

Similarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that's okay.

But let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that's okay.

Another word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.

We also have to avoid C, R, A.

So both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.

We have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me list some words that fit:

- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it's in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.

- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.

- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don't know.

But we also have to consider that we don't know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested before to see if they fit.

In the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.

We could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.

But we can do better.

Another word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.

So E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4
For N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5

We should try to cover new positions.

For example, we haven't tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.

In the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.

Let me think of words that have N and E in different positions.

For instance:
- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.

- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.

- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

We must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.

So let's try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.

Word: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.

Word: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.

Another word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.

Word: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- We test I, L, T.

This seems valid.

Word: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.

Also valid.

Word: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.

But we don't know if U is common.

Word: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.

All these are similar.

Another word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. 
- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.

But note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay to test E in position 4.

Similarly, N in position 3 is okay.

We could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.

Word: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, Y is less common.

Word: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.

Word: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.

We must avoid N in position 4.

So let's try to put E in position 1.

Word: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.

Word: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.

Word: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.

We need both N and E.

Word: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. 
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N in position 2 (allowed)
- Tests D, O, W.

This is valid.

Similarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.

""inlet"" tests I, L, T
""onset"" tests O, S, T
""dines"" tests D, I, S
""endow"" tests D, O, W

S and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.

""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.

But we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.

We can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.

Similarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.

But we don't know what is in those positions.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven't tried and that are common.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.

We should test three new letters that are common.

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

So we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.

""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.

""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.

""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.

""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don't know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.

But note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it's okay.

But we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.

So ""tones"" is also a candidate.

But let me compare:

- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.
- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Both are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.

Similarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

We could choose any.

But we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That's different, so it's good to test a new position.

Similarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.

In ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.

In ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.

In ""dines"", N is in position 3.

In ""inlet"", N is in position 2.

All are new positions.

I think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven't tested before (N in 2, E in 4).

We haven't tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn't tell us about the letter that is actually there.

Similarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.

Position 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.

Position 4 had N (but we know it's not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

Similarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.

So ""onset"" tests:
- Position 1: O (new)
- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it's in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it's present but wrong position)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)
- Position 5: T (new)

This should give us a lot of information.

Similarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

But in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.

L and I are also common, but S is common in both.

But ""onset"" has T, which is very common.

I think ""onset"" is a solid choice.

So I will guess ""onset"".

But let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.

So, next guess: onset.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).

After evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:
- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).
- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.
- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.

<guess>onset</guess>",onset,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

We also know that the secret word must contain N and E, and they are not in the positions we guessed.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so this is our second try.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E (since they are in the word, but we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively).
- We should try to place N and E in different positions to find their correct locations.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since N and E are in the word, we can try to use them in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so N not in 4th, E not in 5th).

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we have to consider the positions.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We tried:
Position 1: C (x) -> not C, and also not the letter that is actually there? But we don't know what is there.
Similarly, we know that the letter in position 1 is not C, and also not R (because R was in position 2 and is absent) and not A (position 3 absent). But we don't know what is in position 1.

We have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.

We can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.

We also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We can try to put N and E in positions we haven't tested and also test other letters.

We also want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Some words: 
- ""lines"": but we don't know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.

But wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.

But we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That's allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that's allowed.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.

Alternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.

Another word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E's? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E's, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don't know about duplicates. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.

However, ""tense"" has two E's, so we might not get full information.

Another word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.

Therefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.

Similarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that's okay.

But let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that's okay.

Another word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.

We also have to avoid C, R, A.

So both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.

We have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me list some words that fit:

- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it's in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.

- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.

- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don't know.

But we also have to consider that we don't know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested before to see if they fit.

In the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.

We could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.

But we can do better.

Another word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.

So E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4
For N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5

We should try to cover new positions.

For example, we haven't tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.

In the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.

Let me think of words that have N and E in different positions.

For instance:
- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.

- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.

- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

We must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.

So let's try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.

Word: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.

Word: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.

Another word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.

Word: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- We test I, L, T.

This seems valid.

Word: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.

Also valid.

Word: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.

But we don't know if U is common.

Word: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.

All these are similar.

Another word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. 
- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.

But note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay to test E in position 4.

Similarly, N in position 3 is okay.

We could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.

Word: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, Y is less common.

Word: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.

Word: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.

We must avoid N in position 4.

So let's try to put E in position 1.

Word: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.

Word: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.

Word: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.

We need both N and E.

Word: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. 
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N in position 2 (allowed)
- Tests D, O, W.

This is valid.

Similarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.

""inlet"" tests I, L, T
""onset"" tests O, S, T
""dines"" tests D, I, S
""endow"" tests D, O, W

S and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.

""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.

But we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.

We can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.

Similarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.

But we don't know what is in those positions.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven't tried and that are common.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.

We should test three new letters that are common.

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

So we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.

""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.

""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.

""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.

""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don't know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.

But note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it's okay.

But we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.

So ""tones"" is also a candidate.

But let me compare:

- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.
- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Both are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.

Similarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

We could choose any.

But we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That's different, so it's good to test a new position.

Similarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.

In ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.

In ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.

In ""dines"", N is in position 3.

In ""inlet"", N is in position 2.

All are new positions.

I think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven't tested before (N in 2, E in 4).

We haven't tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn't tell us about the letter that is actually there.

Similarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.

Position 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.

Position 4 had N (but we know it's not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

Similarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.

So ""onset"" tests:
- Position 1: O (new)
- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it's in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it's present but wrong position)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)
- Position 5: T (new)

This should give us a lot of information.

Similarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

But in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.

L and I are also common, but S is common in both.

But ""onset"" has T, which is very common.

I think ""onset"" is a solid choice.

So I will guess ""onset"".

But let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.

So, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).

After evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:
- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).
- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.
- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.",Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.

I recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let's pick one that might be effective.

One suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, it contains the letter 'S' which is very common.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used as a starting word because it has a high frequency of common letters, but it may not be very common in everyday language. Another good one is ""SLATE"".

Since the instructions don't specify a word list, I'll pick a common word: ""CRANE"". 

Let me consider ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E: five distinct letters.
- Contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
- These letters are fairly common.

But note: the word ""CRANE"" might be more effective because it has a good mix. However, let me also think about ""SALET"", but that's less common.

Another option: ""RAISE"". Let's compare:
- R, A, I, S, E: three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). Very common letters.

According to various sources, ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word. However, to be systematic, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

But wait, I remember that in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a valid word and often used. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good.

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

After this guess, we'll get feedback that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

Therefore, I will output:
<guess> crane </guess>In this first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include:

1. Common letters to increase hit probability
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. Unique letters (no repeats) to test more positions

Based on common Wordle strategies:
- Vowels: A, E are among the most frequent
- Consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C are common
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are statistically strong openers

I choose **CRANE** because:
- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique
- Covering 5/26 letters tests key parts of the word
- High-frequency letters may reveal positions early

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

We also know that the secret word must contain N and E, and they are not in the positions we guessed.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so this is our second try.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E (since they are in the word, but we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively).
- We should try to place N and E in different positions to find their correct locations.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since N and E are in the word, we can try to use them in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so N not in 4th, E not in 5th).

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we have to consider the positions.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We tried:
Position 1: C (x) -> not C, and also not the letter that is actually there? But we don't know what is there.
Similarly, we know that the letter in position 1 is not C, and also not R (because R was in position 2 and is absent) and not A (position 3 absent). But we don't know what is in position 1.

We have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.

We can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.

We also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We can try to put N and E in positions we haven't tested and also test other letters.

We also want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Some words: 
- ""lines"": but we don't know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.

But wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.

But we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That's allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that's allowed.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.

Alternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.

Another word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E's? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E's, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don't know about duplicates. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.

However, ""tense"" has two E's, so we might not get full information.

Another word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.

Therefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.

Similarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that's okay.

But let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that's okay.

Another word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.

We also have to avoid C, R, A.

So both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.

We have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me list some words that fit:

- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it's in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.

- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.

- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don't know.

But we also have to consider that we don't know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested before to see if they fit.

In the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.

We could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.

But we can do better.

Another word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.

So E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4
For N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5

We should try to cover new positions.

For example, we haven't tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.

In the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.

Let me think of words that have N and E in different positions.

For instance:
- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.

- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.

- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

We must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.

So let's try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.

Word: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.

Word: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.

Another word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.

Word: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- We test I, L, T.

This seems valid.

Word: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.

Also valid.

Word: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.

But we don't know if U is common.

Word: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.

All these are similar.

Another word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. 
- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.

But note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay to test E in position 4.

Similarly, N in position 3 is okay.

We could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.

Word: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, Y is less common.

Word: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.

Word: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.

We must avoid N in position 4.

So let's try to put E in position 1.

Word: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.

Word: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.

Word: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.

We need both N and E.

Word: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. 
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N in position 2 (allowed)
- Tests D, O, W.

This is valid.

Similarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.

""inlet"" tests I, L, T
""onset"" tests O, S, T
""dines"" tests D, I, S
""endow"" tests D, O, W

S and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.

""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.

But we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.

We can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.

Similarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.

But we don't know what is in those positions.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven't tried and that are common.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.

We should test three new letters that are common.

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

So we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.

""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.

""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.

""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.

""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don't know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.

But note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it's okay.

But we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.

So ""tones"" is also a candidate.

But let me compare:

- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.
- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Both are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.

Similarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

We could choose any.

But we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That's different, so it's good to test a new position.

Similarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.

In ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.

In ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.

In ""dines"", N is in position 3.

In ""inlet"", N is in position 2.

All are new positions.

I think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven't tested before (N in 2, E in 4).

We haven't tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn't tell us about the letter that is actually there.

Similarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.

Position 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.

Position 4 had N (but we know it's not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

Similarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.

So ""onset"" tests:
- Position 1: O (new)
- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it's in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it's present but wrong position)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)
- Position 5: T (new)

This should give us a lot of information.

Similarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

But in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.

L and I are also common, but S is common in both.

But ""onset"" has T, which is very common.

I think ""onset"" is a solid choice.

So I will guess ""onset"".

But let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.

So, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).

After evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:
- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).
- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.
- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.

So it\'s possible.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.\n\nHowever, ""tense"" has two E\'s, so we might not get full information.\n\nAnother word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.\n\nWe also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.\n\nWe have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n\n- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it\'s in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.\n\n- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.\n\n- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we don\'t know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven\'t tested before to see if they fit.\n\nIn the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.\n\nWe could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.\n\nWord: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAnother word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.\n\nSo E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\nTherefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4\nFor N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe should try to cover new positions.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that have N and E in different positions.\n\nFor instance:\n- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.\n\n- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.\n\n- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.\n\nWe must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\nSo let\'s try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.\n\nWord: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.\n\nWord: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, A.\n\nSo ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.\n\nWord: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.\n\nSo we need a word that has both N and E.\n\nWord: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)\n- We test I, L, T.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nWord: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nWord: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is common.\n\nWord: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.\n\nAll these are similar.\n\nAnother word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. \n- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.\n\nBut note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay to test E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, N in position 3 is okay.\n\nWe could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.\n\nWord: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, Y is less common.\n\nWord: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.\n\nWord: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N in position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to put E in position 1.\n\nWord: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.\n\nWord: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.\n\nWord: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.\n\nWe need both N and E.\n\nWord: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. \n- E in position 1 (allowed)\n- N in position 2 (allowed)\n- Tests D, O, W.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n""inlet"" tests I, L, T\n""onset"" tests O, S, T\n""dines"" tests D, I, S\n""endow"" tests D, O, W\n\nS and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.\n\n""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.\n\nBut we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.\n\nWe can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.\n\nBut we don\'t know what is in those positions.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven\'t tried and that are common.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.\n\nWe should test three new letters that are common.\n\nThe most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.\n\nSo we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.\n\n""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.\n\n""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.\n\n""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.\n\n""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.\n\n""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don\'t know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.\n\nBut note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.\n\nSo ""tones"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.\n- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBoth are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.\n\nSimilarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nWe could choose any.\n\nBut we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That\'s different, so it\'s good to test a new position.\n\nSimilarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nIn ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.\n\nIn ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.\n\nIn ""dines"", N is in position 3.\n\nIn ""inlet"", N is in position 2.\n\nAll are new positions.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven\'t tested before (N in 2, E in 4).\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about the letter that is actually there.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.\n\nPosition 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.\n\nPosition 4 had N (but we know it\'s not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.\n\nSo ""onset"" tests:\n- Position 1: O (new)\n- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it\'s in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it\'s present but wrong position)\n- Position 3: S (new)\n- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nThis should give us a lot of information.\n\nSimilarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.\n\nL and I are also common, but S is common in both.\n\nBut ""onset"" has T, which is very common.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I will guess ""onset"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.\n\nSo, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).\n- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).\n- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:\n- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.\n- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).\n- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.\n- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).

2. Present letters (but wrong position):
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).

3. Absent letters:
   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.

4. Therefore, the secret word has:
   - Position 2: N
   - E in position 1 or 3
   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)

Also, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure so far:

Position 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).
Position 2: N (fixed)
Position 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.
Position 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).
Position 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).

But we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T

So we must avoid these.

Now, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.

Since there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.

We have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

With E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).

Also, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.

We need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.

We should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

First, let's list the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word is: E N _ _ _
And E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.

Actually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word is: _ N E _ _
And O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).

We can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We should choose a word that can test these cases.

We also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.

Letters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the constraints.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.

For example, possible words: 
- E N O _ _ 
- E N _ O _
- E N _ _ O

But we don't know the other letters.

Similarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.

We should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

Let me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.

But we don't know where E is.

We could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it's correct.

Or we could put E in position 3.

But we also need to test other letters.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.

For example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.

Or ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven't tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.

But we don't know if D and W are in the word.

But we can use this to test.

However, we must avoid S, T, etc.

""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.

But let's see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.

Similarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.

But we know E is either in 1 or 3.

So if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.

Specifically:
- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).

Similarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.

Also, we test D and W.

But D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.

Another word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.

""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don't know about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it's correct.

Important: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it's confirmed. So position 2 must be N.

So the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?

With the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.

So we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.

Therefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.

So the guess must have N as the second letter.

So we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.

Now, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.

We know that E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.

But if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.

If we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.

We should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.

For example, if we put E in position 1, then:
- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).

Similarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:
- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.
- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).

But we can also put O in a position that might be likely.

Since we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

The word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.

Possible words:

- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _
  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.
  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? 
    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W
    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid
    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y
  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O
    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.
    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don't know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.
    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.

- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _
  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? 
    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.
    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it's 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.

We need to have N in position 2.

So for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

And O must be in letter4 or letter5.

For example:
- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid
  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E. We need E in position 3.
  - We need E in position 3, so: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
    - ""kneop"" not a word.
    - ""aneos"" not a word.
    - Common words: ""video"" but V, I, D, E, O -> positions: V1, I2, D3, E4, O5 -> not matching, we need position 2 to be N and position 3 to be E.

It's hard to find words with E in position 3 and O in position 4.

Perhaps: ""bneou"" not a word.

Another one: ""sneop"" not a word.

Maybe ""joe"" is three letters.

Perhaps it's rare.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
  - e.g., ""fineo"" not a word.
  - ""mineo"" not common.
  - ""lineo"" not a word.
  - ""pineo"" not a word.
  - ""wineo"" not a word.

Common word: ""cameo"" but C is absent, and positions: C1, A2, M3, E4, O5 -> not matching.

"" cameo"" has A and C absent.

Perhaps ""dicey"" but not.

It seems difficult to find common words with E in position 3 and O in position 5.

Another possibility: ""foyer"" but R absent, and positions: F1, O2, Y3, E4, R5 -> not matching.

Perhaps E in position 3 is less common.

Maybe the word has E in position 1.

Let's go back to the case with E in position 1.

Then we have words like E N ? ? ?

With O in one of the last three positions.

And we need to fill with two other letters.

Common words:
- E N D O W (endow)
- E N V O Y (envoy)
- E N I G M (enigm, not common)
- E N O L S (enols, but S absent)
- E N T E R (but T absent and duplicate E)

So ""endow"" and ""envoy"" are candidates.

""endow"" has D, O, W
""envoy"" has V, O, Y

Both avoid the absent letters.

Now, for the case where E is in position 3, we might find words like:

- U N E A R (but A and R absent)
- I N E P T (T absent)
- O N E R Y (R absent, and O in position 1? But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)

From guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.

So for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.

And letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.

Possible words:
- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.
- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.
- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.
- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.
- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.
- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.
- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.
- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.
- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.
- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.
- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.
- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.

It's hard to find common words with E in position 3.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.

Or ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.

I think it's more likely that E is in position 1.

Therefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".

But we can also choose a word that works for both cases.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.

For example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?

With ? being common letters.

For instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.

""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.

""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2? J1, O2, K3, E4, D5 -> not E in 3.

It's difficult.

""pined"" P I N E D -> positions:1:P, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D -> position 3 is N, not E.

We need a word with the pattern: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

Common words: 
- ""ankle"" A N K L E -> but A absent, and position 2 is N, position 3 is K, not E.
- ""apple"" A P P L E -> A absent, duplicate P.
- ""aisle"" A I S L E -> A and S absent.
- ""oxide"" O X I D E -> O in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1, so invalid.
- ""exile"" E X I L E -> duplicate E, and position 1 is E, but we are testing E in position 3? Not.

Perhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.

I think it's challenging.

Maybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

So perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.

So we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.

For example, ""endow"".

""endow"" is E N D O W.

This tests:
- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).
- N in position 2: we know it's correct, so we get ✓.
- D in position 3: new letter.
- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).
- W in position 5: new letter.

This will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.

If we are lucky, we might even guess the word.

Another option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.

But V and Y are less common.

""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.

But let's choose ""endow"".

We have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.

""eclat"" has C and A absent.

So ""endow"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.

Must include E.

So I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""endow"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).
   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.

3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:
   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.
   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).
   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.
- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.
- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.
- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:
  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).
  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).
  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.

### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":
- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.
- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).
- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.
- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).

<guess>endow</guess>",endow,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).

2. Present letters (but wrong position):
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).

3. Absent letters:
   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.

4. Therefore, the secret word has:
   - Position 2: N
   - E in position 1 or 3
   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)

Also, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure so far:

Position 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).
Position 2: N (fixed)
Position 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.
Position 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).
Position 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).

But we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T

So we must avoid these.

Now, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.

Since there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.

We have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

With E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).

Also, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.

We need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.

We should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

First, let's list the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word is: E N _ _ _
And E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.

Actually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word is: _ N E _ _
And O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).

We can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We should choose a word that can test these cases.

We also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.

Letters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the constraints.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.

For example, possible words: 
- E N O _ _ 
- E N _ O _
- E N _ _ O

But we don't know the other letters.

Similarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.

We should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

Let me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.

But we don't know where E is.

We could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it's correct.

Or we could put E in position 3.

But we also need to test other letters.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.

For example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.

Or ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven't tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.

But we don't know if D and W are in the word.

But we can use this to test.

However, we must avoid S, T, etc.

""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.

But let's see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.

Similarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.

But we know E is either in 1 or 3.

So if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.

Specifically:
- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).

Similarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.

Also, we test D and W.

But D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.

Another word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.

""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don't know about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it's correct.

Important: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it's confirmed. So position 2 must be N.

So the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?

With the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.

So we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.

Therefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.

So the guess must have N as the second letter.

So we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.

Now, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.

We know that E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.

But if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.

If we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.

We should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.

For example, if we put E in position 1, then:
- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).

Similarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:
- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.
- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).

But we can also put O in a position that might be likely.

Since we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

The word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.

Possible words:

- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _
  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.
  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? 
    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W
    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid
    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y
  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O
    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.
    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don't know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.
    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.

- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _
  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? 
    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.
    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it's 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.

We need to have N in position 2.

So for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

And O must be in letter4 or letter5.

For example:
- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid
  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E. We need E in position 3.
  - We need E in position 3, so: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
    - ""kneop"" not a word.
    - ""aneos"" not a word.
    - Common words: ""video"" but V, I, D, E, O -> positions: V1, I2, D3, E4, O5 -> not matching, we need position 2 to be N and position 3 to be E.

It's hard to find words with E in position 3 and O in position 4.

Perhaps: ""bneou"" not a word.

Another one: ""sneop"" not a word.

Maybe ""joe"" is three letters.

Perhaps it's rare.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
  - e.g., ""fineo"" not a word.
  - ""mineo"" not common.
  - ""lineo"" not a word.
  - ""pineo"" not a word.
  - ""wineo"" not a word.

Common word: ""cameo"" but C is absent, and positions: C1, A2, M3, E4, O5 -> not matching.

"" cameo"" has A and C absent.

Perhaps ""dicey"" but not.

It seems difficult to find common words with E in position 3 and O in position 5.

Another possibility: ""foyer"" but R absent, and positions: F1, O2, Y3, E4, R5 -> not matching.

Perhaps E in position 3 is less common.

Maybe the word has E in position 1.

Let's go back to the case with E in position 1.

Then we have words like E N ? ? ?

With O in one of the last three positions.

And we need to fill with two other letters.

Common words:
- E N D O W (endow)
- E N V O Y (envoy)
- E N I G M (enigm, not common)
- E N O L S (enols, but S absent)
- E N T E R (but T absent and duplicate E)

So ""endow"" and ""envoy"" are candidates.

""endow"" has D, O, W
""envoy"" has V, O, Y

Both avoid the absent letters.

Now, for the case where E is in position 3, we might find words like:

- U N E A R (but A and R absent)
- I N E P T (T absent)
- O N E R Y (R absent, and O in position 1? But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)

From guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.

So for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.

And letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.

Possible words:
- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.
- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.
- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.
- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.
- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.
- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.
- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.
- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.
- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.
- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.
- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.
- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.

It's hard to find common words with E in position 3.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.

Or ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.

I think it's more likely that E is in position 1.

Therefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".

But we can also choose a word that works for both cases.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.

For example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?

With ? being common letters.

For instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.

""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.

""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2? J1, O2, K3, E4, D5 -> not E in 3.

It's difficult.

""pined"" P I N E D -> positions:1:P, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D -> position 3 is N, not E.

We need a word with the pattern: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

Common words: 
- ""ankle"" A N K L E -> but A absent, and position 2 is N, position 3 is K, not E.
- ""apple"" A P P L E -> A absent, duplicate P.
- ""aisle"" A I S L E -> A and S absent.
- ""oxide"" O X I D E -> O in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1, so invalid.
- ""exile"" E X I L E -> duplicate E, and position 1 is E, but we are testing E in position 3? Not.

Perhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.

I think it's challenging.

Maybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

So perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.

So we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.

For example, ""endow"".

""endow"" is E N D O W.

This tests:
- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).
- N in position 2: we know it's correct, so we get ✓.
- D in position 3: new letter.
- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).
- W in position 5: new letter.

This will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.

If we are lucky, we might even guess the word.

Another option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.

But V and Y are less common.

""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.

But let's choose ""endow"".

We have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.

""eclat"" has C and A absent.

So ""endow"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.

Must include E.

So I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""endow"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).
   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.

3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:
   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.
   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).
   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.
- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.
- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.
- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:
  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).
  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).
  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.

### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":
- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.
- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).
- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.
- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).",Guess 3: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓) W(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.

I recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let's pick one that might be effective.

One suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, it contains the letter 'S' which is very common.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used as a starting word because it has a high frequency of common letters, but it may not be very common in everyday language. Another good one is ""SLATE"".

Since the instructions don't specify a word list, I'll pick a common word: ""CRANE"". 

Let me consider ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E: five distinct letters.
- Contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
- These letters are fairly common.

But note: the word ""CRANE"" might be more effective because it has a good mix. However, let me also think about ""SALET"", but that's less common.

Another option: ""RAISE"". Let's compare:
- R, A, I, S, E: three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). Very common letters.

According to various sources, ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word. However, to be systematic, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

But wait, I remember that in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a valid word and often used. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good.

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

After this guess, we'll get feedback that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

Therefore, I will output:
<guess> crane </guess>In this first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include:

1. Common letters to increase hit probability
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. Unique letters (no repeats) to test more positions

Based on common Wordle strategies:
- Vowels: A, E are among the most frequent
- Consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C are common
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are statistically strong openers

I choose **CRANE** because:
- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique
- Covering 5/26 letters tests key parts of the word
- High-frequency letters may reveal positions early

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

We also know that the secret word must contain N and E, and they are not in the positions we guessed.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so this is our second try.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E (since they are in the word, but we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively).
- We should try to place N and E in different positions to find their correct locations.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since N and E are in the word, we can try to use them in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so N not in 4th, E not in 5th).

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we have to consider the positions.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We tried:
Position 1: C (x) -> not C, and also not the letter that is actually there? But we don't know what is there.
Similarly, we know that the letter in position 1 is not C, and also not R (because R was in position 2 and is absent) and not A (position 3 absent). But we don't know what is in position 1.

We have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.

We can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.

We also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We can try to put N and E in positions we haven't tested and also test other letters.

We also want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Some words: 
- ""lines"": but we don't know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.

But wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.

But we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That's allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that's allowed.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.

Alternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.

Another word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E's? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E's, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don't know about duplicates. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.

However, ""tense"" has two E's, so we might not get full information.

Another word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.

Therefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.

Similarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that's okay.

But let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that's okay.

Another word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.

We also have to avoid C, R, A.

So both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.

We have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me list some words that fit:

- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it's in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.

- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.

- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don't know.

But we also have to consider that we don't know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested before to see if they fit.

In the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.

We could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.

But we can do better.

Another word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.

So E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4
For N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5

We should try to cover new positions.

For example, we haven't tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.

In the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.

Let me think of words that have N and E in different positions.

For instance:
- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.

- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.

- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

We must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.

So let's try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.

Word: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.

Word: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.

Another word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.

Word: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- We test I, L, T.

This seems valid.

Word: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.

Also valid.

Word: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.

But we don't know if U is common.

Word: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.

All these are similar.

Another word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. 
- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.

But note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay to test E in position 4.

Similarly, N in position 3 is okay.

We could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.

Word: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, Y is less common.

Word: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.

Word: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.

We must avoid N in position 4.

So let's try to put E in position 1.

Word: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.

Word: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.

Word: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.

We need both N and E.

Word: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. 
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N in position 2 (allowed)
- Tests D, O, W.

This is valid.

Similarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.

""inlet"" tests I, L, T
""onset"" tests O, S, T
""dines"" tests D, I, S
""endow"" tests D, O, W

S and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.

""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.

But we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.

We can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.

Similarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.

But we don't know what is in those positions.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven't tried and that are common.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.

We should test three new letters that are common.

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

So we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.

""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.

""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.

""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.

""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don't know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.

But note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it's okay.

But we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.

So ""tones"" is also a candidate.

But let me compare:

- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.
- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Both are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.

Similarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

We could choose any.

But we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That's different, so it's good to test a new position.

Similarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.

In ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.

In ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.

In ""dines"", N is in position 3.

In ""inlet"", N is in position 2.

All are new positions.

I think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven't tested before (N in 2, E in 4).

We haven't tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn't tell us about the letter that is actually there.

Similarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.

Position 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.

Position 4 had N (but we know it's not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

Similarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.

So ""onset"" tests:
- Position 1: O (new)
- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it's in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it's present but wrong position)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)
- Position 5: T (new)

This should give us a lot of information.

Similarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

But in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.

L and I are also common, but S is common in both.

But ""onset"" has T, which is very common.

I think ""onset"" is a solid choice.

So I will guess ""onset"".

But let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.

So, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).

After evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:
- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).
- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.
- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).

2. Present letters (but wrong position):
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).

3. Absent letters:
   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.

4. Therefore, the secret word has:
   - Position 2: N
   - E in position 1 or 3
   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)

Also, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure so far:

Position 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).
Position 2: N (fixed)
Position 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.
Position 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).
Position 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).

But we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T

So we must avoid these.

Now, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.

Since there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.

We have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

With E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).

Also, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.

We need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.

We should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

First, let's list the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word is: E N _ _ _
And E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.

Actually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word is: _ N E _ _
And O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).

We can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We should choose a word that can test these cases.

We also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.

Letters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the constraints.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.

For example, possible words: 
- E N O _ _ 
- E N _ O _
- E N _ _ O

But we don't know the other letters.

Similarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.

We should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

Let me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.

But we don't know where E is.

We could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it's correct.

Or we could put E in position 3.

But we also need to test other letters.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.

For example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.

Or ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven't tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.

But we don't know if D and W are in the word.

But we can use this to test.

However, we must avoid S, T, etc.

""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.

But let's see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.

Similarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.

But we know E is either in 1 or 3.

So if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.

Specifically:
- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).

Similarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.

Also, we test D and W.

But D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.

Another word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.

""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don't know about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it's correct.

Important: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it's confirmed. So position 2 must be N.

So the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?

With the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.

So we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.

Therefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.

So the guess must have N as the second letter.

So we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.

Now, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.

We know that E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.

But if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.

If we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.

We should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.

For example, if we put E in position 1, then:
- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).

Similarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:
- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.
- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).

But we can also put O in a position that might be likely.

Since we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

The word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.

Possible words:

- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _
  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.
  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? 
    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W
    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid
    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y
  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O
    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.
    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don't know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.
    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.

- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _
  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? 
    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.
    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it's 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.

We need to have N in position 2.

So for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

And O must be in letter4 or letter5.

For example:
- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid
  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E. We need E in position 3.
  - We need E in position 3, so: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
    - ""kneop"" not a word.
    - ""aneos"" not a word.
    - Common words: ""video"" but V, I, D, E, O -> positions: V1, I2, D3, E4, O5 -> not matching, we need position 2 to be N and position 3 to be E.

It's hard to find words with E in position 3 and O in position 4.

Perhaps: ""bneou"" not a word.

Another one: ""sneop"" not a word.

Maybe ""joe"" is three letters.

Perhaps it's rare.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
  - e.g., ""fineo"" not a word.
  - ""mineo"" not common.
  - ""lineo"" not a word.
  - ""pineo"" not a word.
  - ""wineo"" not a word.

Common word: ""cameo"" but C is absent, and positions: C1, A2, M3, E4, O5 -> not matching.

"" cameo"" has A and C absent.

Perhaps ""dicey"" but not.

It seems difficult to find common words with E in position 3 and O in position 5.

Another possibility: ""foyer"" but R absent, and positions: F1, O2, Y3, E4, R5 -> not matching.

Perhaps E in position 3 is less common.

Maybe the word has E in position 1.

Let's go back to the case with E in position 1.

Then we have words like E N ? ? ?

With O in one of the last three positions.

And we need to fill with two other letters.

Common words:
- E N D O W (endow)
- E N V O Y (envoy)
- E N I G M (enigm, not common)
- E N O L S (enols, but S absent)
- E N T E R (but T absent and duplicate E)

So ""endow"" and ""envoy"" are candidates.

""endow"" has D, O, W
""envoy"" has V, O, Y

Both avoid the absent letters.

Now, for the case where E is in position 3, we might find words like:

- U N E A R (but A and R absent)
- I N E P T (T absent)
- O N E R Y (R absent, and O in position 1? But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)

From guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.

So for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.

And letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.

Possible words:
- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.
- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.
- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.
- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.
- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.
- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.
- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.
- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.
- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.
- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.
- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.
- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.

It's hard to find common words with E in position 3.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.

Or ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.

I think it's more likely that E is in position 1.

Therefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".

But we can also choose a word that works for both cases.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.

For example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?

With ? being common letters.

For instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.

""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.

""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2? J1, O2, K3, E4, D5 -> not E in 3.

It's difficult.

""pined"" P I N E D -> positions:1:P, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D -> position 3 is N, not E.

We need a word with the pattern: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

Common words: 
- ""ankle"" A N K L E -> but A absent, and position 2 is N, position 3 is K, not E.
- ""apple"" A P P L E -> A absent, duplicate P.
- ""aisle"" A I S L E -> A and S absent.
- ""oxide"" O X I D E -> O in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1, so invalid.
- ""exile"" E X I L E -> duplicate E, and position 1 is E, but we are testing E in position 3? Not.

Perhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.

I think it's challenging.

Maybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

So perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.

So we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.

For example, ""endow"".

""endow"" is E N D O W.

This tests:
- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).
- N in position 2: we know it's correct, so we get ✓.
- D in position 3: new letter.
- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).
- W in position 5: new letter.

This will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.

If we are lucky, we might even guess the word.

Another option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.

But V and Y are less common.

""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.

But let's choose ""endow"".

We have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.

""eclat"" has C and A absent.

So ""endow"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.

Must include E.

So I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""endow"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).
   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.

3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:
   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.
   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).
   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.
- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.
- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.
- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:
  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).
  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).
  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.

### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":
- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.
- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).
- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.
- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).

A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.\n\nI recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let\'s pick one that might be effective.\n\nOne suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants.

However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don\'t know about duplicates. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.\n\nHowever, ""tense"" has two E\'s, so we might not get full information.\n\nAnother word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.\n\nWe also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.\n\nWe have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n\n- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it\'s in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.\n\n- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.\n\n- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we don\'t know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven\'t tested before to see if they fit.\n\nIn the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.\n\nWe could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.\n\nWord: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAnother word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.\n\nSo E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\nTherefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4\nFor N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe should try to cover new positions.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that have N and E in different positions.\n\nFor instance:\n- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.\n\n- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.\n\n- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.\n\nWe must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\nSo let\'s try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.\n\nWord: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.\n\nWord: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, A.\n\nSo ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.\n\nWord: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.\n\nSo we need a word that has both N and E.\n\nWord: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)\n- We test I, L, T.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nWord: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nWord: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is common.\n\nWord: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.\n\nAll these are similar.\n\nAnother word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. \n- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.\n\nBut note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay to test E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, N in position 3 is okay.\n\nWe could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.\n\nWord: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, Y is less common.\n\nWord: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.\n\nWord: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N in position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to put E in position 1.\n\nWord: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.\n\nWord: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.\n\nWord: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.\n\nWe need both N and E.\n\nWord: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. \n- E in position 1 (allowed)\n- N in position 2 (allowed)\n- Tests D, O, W.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n""inlet"" tests I, L, T\n""onset"" tests O, S, T\n""dines"" tests D, I, S\n""endow"" tests D, O, W\n\nS and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.\n\n""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.\n\nBut we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.\n\nWe can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.\n\nBut we don\'t know what is in those positions.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven\'t tried and that are common.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.\n\nWe should test three new letters that are common.\n\nThe most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.\n\nSo we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.\n\n""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.\n\n""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.\n\n""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.\n\n""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.\n\n""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don\'t know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.\n\nBut note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.\n\nSo ""tones"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.\n- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBoth are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.\n\nSimilarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nWe could choose any.\n\nBut we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That\'s different, so it\'s good to test a new position.\n\nSimilarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nIn ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.\n\nIn ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.\n\nIn ""dines"", N is in position 3.\n\nIn ""inlet"", N is in position 2.\n\nAll are new positions.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven\'t tested before (N in 2, E in 4).\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about the letter that is actually there.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.\n\nPosition 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.\n\nPosition 4 had N (but we know it\'s not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.\n\nSo ""onset"" tests:\n- Position 1: O (new)\n- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it\'s in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it\'s present but wrong position)\n- Position 3: S (new)\n- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nThis should give us a lot of information.\n\nSimilarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.\n\nL and I are also common, but S is common in both.\n\nBut ""onset"" has T, which is very common.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I will guess ""onset"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.\n\nSo, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).\n- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).\n- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:\n- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.\n- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).\n- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.\n- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""onset""\n- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. Confirmed letters:\n   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).\n\n2. Present letters (but wrong position):\n   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).\n   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).\n\n3. Absent letters:\n   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.\n\n4. Therefore, the secret word has:\n   - Position 2: N\n   - E in position 1 or 3\n   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)\n\nAlso, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.\n\nNow, the word structure so far:\n\nPosition 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).\nPosition 2: N (fixed)\nPosition 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.\nPosition 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).\nPosition 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).\n\nBut we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, S, T\n\nSo we must avoid these.\n\nNow, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.\n\nSince there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.\n\nWe have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _\n\nWith E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.\n\nWe need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.\n\nWe should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nFirst, let\'s list the possibilities for E:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1.\nThen the word is: E N _ _ _\nAnd E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.\n\nActually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.\n\nCase 2: E in position 3.\nThen the word is: _ N E _ _\nAnd O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).\n\nWe can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe should choose a word that can test these cases.\n\nWe also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.\n\nLetters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words that fit the constraints.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.\n\nFor example, possible words: \n- E N O _ _ \n- E N _ O _\n- E N _ _ O\n\nBut we don\'t know the other letters.\n\nSimilarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.\n\nWe should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.\n\nBut we don\'t know where E is.\n\nWe could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it\'s correct.\n\nOr we could put E in position 3.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.\n\nOr ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven\'t tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D and W are in the word.\n\nBut we can use this to test.\n\nHowever, we must avoid S, T, etc.\n\n""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.\n\nSimilarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.\n\nBut we know E is either in 1 or 3.\n\nSo if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.\n- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).\n\nSimilarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.\n\nAlso, we test D and W.\n\nBut D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.\n\n""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it\'s correct.\n\nImportant: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it\'s confirmed. So position 2 must be N.\n\nSo the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?\n\nWith the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.\n\nSo we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.\n\nTherefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.\n\nSo the guess must have N as the second letter.\n\nSo we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.\n\nNow, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.\n\nWe know that E must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.\n\nBut if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.\n\nIf we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.\n\nWe should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.\n\nFor example, if we put E in position 1, then:\n- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.\n- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).\n\nSimilarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:\n- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.\n- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).\n\nBut we can also put O in a position that might be likely.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.\n\nThe word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _\n  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.\n  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? \n    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W\n    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid\n    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y\n  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O\n    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.\n    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don\'t know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.\n    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.\n\n- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _\n  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? \n    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.\n    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it\'s 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.\n\nWe need to have N in position 2.\n\nSo for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd O must be in letter4 or letter5.\n\nFor example:\n- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]\n  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid\n  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E. We need E in position 3.\n  - We need E in position 3, so: [letter1] N E O [letter5]\n    - ""kneop"" not a word.\n    - ""aneos"" not a word.\n    - Common words: ""video"" but V, I, D, E, O -> positions: V1, I2, D3, E4, O5 -> not matching, we need position 2 to be N and position 3 to be E.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with E in position 3 and O in position 4.\n\nPerhaps: ""bneou"" not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""sneop"" not a word.\n\nMaybe ""joe"" is three letters.\n\nPerhaps it\'s rare.\n\nWith O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O\n  - e.g., ""fineo"" not a word.\n  - ""mineo"" not common.\n  - ""lineo"" not a word.\n  - ""pineo"" not a word.\n  - ""wineo"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""cameo"" but C is absent, and positions: C1, A2, M3, E4, O5 -> not matching.\n\n"" cameo"" has A and C absent.\n\nPerhaps ""dicey"" but not.\n\nIt seems difficult to find common words with E in position 3 and O in position 5.\n\nAnother possibility: ""foyer"" but R absent, and positions: F1, O2, Y3, E4, R5 -> not matching.\n\nPerhaps E in position 3 is less common.\n\nMaybe the word has E in position 1.\n\nLet\'s go back to the case with E in position 1.\n\nThen we have words like E N ? ? ?\n\nWith O in one of the last three positions.\n\nAnd we need to fill with two other letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- E N D O W (endow)\n- E N V O Y (envoy)\n- E N I G M (enigm, not common)\n- E N O L S (enols, but S absent)\n- E N T E R (but T absent and duplicate E)\n\nSo ""endow"" and ""envoy"" are candidates.\n\n""endow"" has D, O, W\n""envoy"" has V, O, Y\n\nBoth avoid the absent letters.\n\nNow, for the case where E is in position 3, we might find words like:\n\n- U N E A R (but A and R absent)\n- I N E P T (T absent)\n- O N E R Y (R absent, and O in position 1? But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)\n\nFrom guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.\n\nSo for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.\n\nAnd letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.\n- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.\n- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.\n- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.\n- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.\n- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.\n- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.\n- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.\n\nWith O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O\n- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.\n- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.\n- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.\n- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.\n- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.\n- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.\n- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.\n\nIt\'s hard to find common words with E in position 3.\n\nPerhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.\n\nOr ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.\n\nI think it\'s more likely that E is in position 1.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".\n\nBut we can also choose a word that works for both cases.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.\n\nFor example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?\n\nWith ? being common letters.\n\nFor instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.\n\nWe need position 3 to be E.\n\n""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.\n\n""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.\n\n""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2? J1, O2, K3, E4, D5 -> not E in 3.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\n""pined"" P I N E D -> positions:1:P, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D -> position 3 is N, not E.\n\nWe need a word with the pattern: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ankle"" A N K L E -> but A absent, and position 2 is N, position 3 is K, not E.\n- ""apple"" A P P L E -> A absent, duplicate P.\n- ""aisle"" A I S L E -> A and S absent.\n- ""oxide"" O X I D E -> O in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1, so invalid.\n- ""exile"" E X I L E -> duplicate E, and position 1 is E, but we are testing E in position 3? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.\n\nI think it\'s challenging.\n\nMaybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.\n\nNot.\n\n""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.\n\nNot.\n\nSo perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.\n\nSo we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.\n\nFor example, ""endow"".\n\n""endow"" is E N D O W.\n\nThis tests:\n- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).\n- N in position 2: we know it\'s correct, so we get ✓.\n- D in position 3: new letter.\n- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).\n- W in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.\n\nIf we are lucky, we might even guess the word.\n\nAnother option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.\n\nBut V and Y are less common.\n\n""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""endow"".\n\nWe have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.\n\n""eclat"" has C and A absent.\n\nSo ""endow"" seems a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.\n\nMust include E.\n\nSo I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""endow"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)\n- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**\n   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).\n   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\n2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.\n\n3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:\n   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.\n   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).\n   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.\n- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.\n- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.\n- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.\n- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:\n  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).\n  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).\n  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.\n  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.\n\n### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":\n- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.\n- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).\n- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.\n- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).\n\n<guess>endow</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
  - C, R, A are absent.
  - N is present but not in position 4.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)
  - O is present but not in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - S is absent.
  - E is present but not in position 4.
  - T is absent.

Guess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)
  - E is correct in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - D is absent.
  - O is correct in position 4.
  - W is absent.

Now, from this feedback, we can deduce:

1. **Correct letters in known positions:**
   - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" feedback)
   - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" and confirmed in ""endow"")
   - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" feedback)

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W are not in the word.

3. **Present letters from previous feedback:**
   - We know E, N, O are in the word and now we know their positions: E in 1, N in 2, O in 4.

4. **Word structure so far:**
   - The secret word is: E N _ O _
   - We need to fill positions 3 and 5.

5. **Constraints for positions 3 and 5:**
   - The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, W.
   - We have two letters to determine.

6. **Additional information:**
   - From guess 1, we know that N is not in position 4 (but we now know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but we now know it's in position 1). So no new constraints for positions 3 and 5 from that.
   - From guess 2, we know O is not in position 1 (but now in 4) and E is not in position 4 (now in 1). Also, S and T are absent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form E N ? O ? 

The missing letters (position 3 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: A, C, D, R, S, T, W

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we should focus on common letters.

We have two positions to fill, and we need to guess a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible common letters for position 3 and 5: L, I, U, M, P, H, etc.

We can list possible words that fit E N ? O ? 

For example:
- E N I O R → but R is absent.
- E N O O ? → duplicate O? But we don't know if O is duplicated. However, in ""endow"", O was in position 4 and marked correct, so if there were two O's, we might have seen it? But in ""onset"", O was in position 1 and marked present but wrong position, but we now know O is in position 4. Since we haven't seen a second O marked, it's possible but less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Common words:
- ""enrol"" → E N R O L → but R is absent and L in position 5? Also, R absent.
- ""envoy"" → E N V O Y → V and Y. We haven't tried V or Y. But in guess 3, we tried ""endow"" and D and W were absent, so V and Y are possible.
- ""ebony"" → E B O N Y → but position 2 is B? No, we have E B O N Y, so position 3 is O? But we need position 4 to be O, and in ""ebony"", position 4 is N, which is already in position 2. So not matching.
- ""elbow"" → E L B O W → but W is absent (from guess 3).
- ""endue"" → E N D U E → D absent and duplicate E? Not good.
- ""ennui"" → E N N U I → duplicate N? And we know N is only one? Not necessarily, but in guess 1, N was present once, and in guess 2 and 3, only one N. But we can avoid duplicates.

Let's list valid words:

- ""enoki"" → a type of mushroom. E N O K I → but position 4 is O? In ""enoki"", positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:K, 5:I → but we need position 4 to be O, so this has O in position 3, not 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be O, so the word must be E N ? O ? 

So position 3 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.

Examples:
- ""envoy"": E N V O Y → V in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enjoy"": E N J O Y → J in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enmity"": too long, 6 letters.
- ""enter"": E N T E R → T and R absent, and duplicate E? Not valid.
- ""euros"": E U R O S → R and S absent.
- ""ethos"": E T H O S → T and S absent.
- ""expos"": E X P O S → S absent.

Less common:
- ""enfix"": not common.
- ""enzym"": E N Z Y M → Z, Y, M.

But let's consider common words.

Another one: ""enrol"" but R absent.

""envoi"": E N V O I → similar to ""envoy"", but with I at the end. ""envoi"" is a word (a concluding stanza).

So E N V O I.

""envoy"" is E N V O Y.

Both are valid.

We also have ""ebony"", but it doesn't fit the pattern.

""elbow"" has W absent.

""endow"" we already tried, and D and W absent.

Another word: ""euros"" but R and S absent.

""ethos"" T and S absent.

""epoxy"" E P O X Y → but position 2 is P? E P O X Y → not E N ? O ? 

We need N in position 2.

So back to ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" or ""enjoy"".

""enjoy"" has J, which is less common.

""envoy"" has V and Y.

""envoi"" has V and I.

I is more common than Y.

But we don't know.

We can also consider ""ennui"" but duplicate N.

Another common word: ""enough"" → 6 letters.

""ensue"" → E N S U E → S absent and duplicate E.

Not.

So possible words: ""envoy"", ""envoi"", ""enzym"" (less common), ""enjoy"".

We should choose one that tests common letters.

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses common letters for position 3 and 5.

Common consonants: L, H, P, M, etc.

But in the pattern E N ? O ?, what words have common letters?

For example, ""enhol"" not a word.

""enmew"" not a word.

Perhaps ""eupad"" not a word.

I think ""envoy"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L or H.

""enol"" is 4 letters.

""enols"" has S absent.

""enrol"" has R absent.

""ethol"" not a word.

So ""envoy"" might be the best.

But we have another option: since we know E, N, O are fixed, we can try to solve for the remaining letters.

We have position 3 and 5 to fill.

We can guess a word that has common letters, say L and H, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""enol k"" not.

Perhaps ""belch"" not matching.

I think we have to choose from the available words.

Another word: ""euros"" not.

""educe"" E D U C E → D and C absent.

Not.

So I think ""envoy"" is a good guess.

But in ""envoy"", we have V and Y. V is not extremely common, but it's possible.

""envoi"" has V and I, which might be better because I is a vowel and more common.

""envoi"" is a valid word, meaning a concluding part of a poem.

Similarly, ""envoy"" is a messenger.

Both are acceptable.

I'll go with ""envoi"" because I is more common than Y.

But let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess ""envoi"":
- Position 1: E (should be ✓, since we know it's correct)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: V (if V is in the word, we get feedback; if not, x)
- Position 4: O (✓)
- Position 5: I (if I is in the word, we get feedback)

Similarly for ""envoy"".

But we need to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.

Since we have only two positions, and we know the word is E N ? O ?, we might even guess it.

But we don't know the letters.

Another common word: ""euros"" not.

""piano"" not matching.

I recall that ""genoa"" but G not in position 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""knoll"" not.

I think ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" are fine.

But let's choose ""envoy"" as it is more common.

To be systematic, we can list all possible words.

Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

For position 5: same, but must form a valid word.

Common words:
- envoy (V and Y)
- envoi (V and I)
- enjoy (J and Y) — J is less common
- enzym (Z and M) — less common
- enfix (F and X) — rare

Also, ""enmew"" not a word.

""enbow"" but W absent.

So between ""envoy"" and ""envoi"", I'll pick ""envoy"" because it's more familiar.

But we have feedback that might help.

We know the word is E N _ O _

With the middle letter and last letter to be guessed.

We can also consider that in the first guess, no other letters were present, and in the second, only O and E were present besides N, and in the third, only E, N, O were correct and D and W absent.

So the word has exactly three of the letters we've tested? But we tested more.

Actually, we tested C,R,A,N,E in first; O,N,S,E,T in second; E,N,D,O,W in third.

The present letters are E, N, O, and no others from the tested ones.

So the remaining two letters are from the untested set.

Untested letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need to choose two of these for positions 3 and 5.

Common combinations: for example, L and D, but D is absent.

D is absent.

So not.

H and Y? But what word?

E N H O Y? Not a word.

U and L: E N U O L? Not a word.

I and L: E N I O L? Not a word.

V and Y: E N V O Y → envoy, which is a word.

V and I: E N V O I → envoi.

So those are the only common words.

Therefore, we can guess ""envoy"".

But let's see if there is a word with H.

E N H O ? 

""enhol"" not.

""enhop"" not.

Or with G: ""engot"" not.

So I think ""envoy"" is the best choice.

We'll guess ""envoy"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** 
     - C, R, A are absent (x).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""onset""):** 
     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - S and T are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""endow""):** 
     - E is correct in position 1 (✓).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - D is absent (x).
     - O is correct in position 4 (✓).
     - W is absent (x).

2. **Deductions:**
   - **Confirmed Positions:**
     - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" ✓ and ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" ✓).
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W (all marked x in previous guesses).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must be of the form `E N ? O ?`, where:
     - The third and fifth positions need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
     - The letters must be from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, S, T, D, W are eliminated).
   - **Constraints from Feedback:**
     - E cannot be in position 5 (from ""crane"" -), but this is already satisfied as E is fixed at position 1.
     - O cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" -), but this is satisfied as O is fixed at position 4.
     - N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" -), but this is satisfied as N is fixed at position 2.
   - **No Duplicates Likely:** Previous feedback showed no evidence of duplicate letters (e.g., only one N and E were ever marked), so we assume no duplicates for simplicity.

3. **Identify Possible Words:**
   - The secret word is `E N ? O ?`. We need valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern, using letters not in the absent list.
   - Common options:
     - **""envoy""**: E N V O Y (V in position 3, Y in position 5).
     - **""envoi""**: E N V O I (V in position 3, I in position 5).
     - **""enjoy""**: E N J O Y (J in position 3, Y in position 5), but J is less common.
     - Other possibilities like ""enzym"" (E N Z Y M) are rare and less ideal.
   - ""envoy"" is chosen because:
     - It uses common letters (V and Y are reasonably frequent).
     - It tests high-value positions (3 and 5) with new letters.
     - It is a familiar English word (meaning a messenger), increasing the likelihood of being valid.
     - Alternatives like ""envoi"" (less common) or ""enjoy"" (J is infrequent) are weaker.

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Resolve the two unknown positions (3 and 5) by testing V and Y.
   - **Expected Feedback:**
     - E (position 1), N (position 2), and O (position 4) will be correct (✓) again.
     - V (position 3) and Y (position 5) will provide new feedback: ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, or x if absent.
     - If ""envoy"" is incorrect, feedback will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if V or Y is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other letters like I, L, or H for the next guess).

5. **Final Decision:** ""envoy"" is the best guess to maximize information and progress toward the solution.

<guess>envoy</guess>",envoy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
  - C, R, A are absent.
  - N is present but not in position 4.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)
  - O is present but not in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - S is absent.
  - E is present but not in position 4.
  - T is absent.

Guess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)
  - E is correct in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - D is absent.
  - O is correct in position 4.
  - W is absent.

Now, from this feedback, we can deduce:

1. **Correct letters in known positions:**
   - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" feedback)
   - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" and confirmed in ""endow"")
   - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" feedback)

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W are not in the word.

3. **Present letters from previous feedback:**
   - We know E, N, O are in the word and now we know their positions: E in 1, N in 2, O in 4.

4. **Word structure so far:**
   - The secret word is: E N _ O _
   - We need to fill positions 3 and 5.

5. **Constraints for positions 3 and 5:**
   - The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, W.
   - We have two letters to determine.

6. **Additional information:**
   - From guess 1, we know that N is not in position 4 (but we now know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but we now know it's in position 1). So no new constraints for positions 3 and 5 from that.
   - From guess 2, we know O is not in position 1 (but now in 4) and E is not in position 4 (now in 1). Also, S and T are absent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form E N ? O ? 

The missing letters (position 3 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: A, C, D, R, S, T, W

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we should focus on common letters.

We have two positions to fill, and we need to guess a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible common letters for position 3 and 5: L, I, U, M, P, H, etc.

We can list possible words that fit E N ? O ? 

For example:
- E N I O R → but R is absent.
- E N O O ? → duplicate O? But we don't know if O is duplicated. However, in ""endow"", O was in position 4 and marked correct, so if there were two O's, we might have seen it? But in ""onset"", O was in position 1 and marked present but wrong position, but we now know O is in position 4. Since we haven't seen a second O marked, it's possible but less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Common words:
- ""enrol"" → E N R O L → but R is absent and L in position 5? Also, R absent.
- ""envoy"" → E N V O Y → V and Y. We haven't tried V or Y. But in guess 3, we tried ""endow"" and D and W were absent, so V and Y are possible.
- ""ebony"" → E B O N Y → but position 2 is B? No, we have E B O N Y, so position 3 is O? But we need position 4 to be O, and in ""ebony"", position 4 is N, which is already in position 2. So not matching.
- ""elbow"" → E L B O W → but W is absent (from guess 3).
- ""endue"" → E N D U E → D absent and duplicate E? Not good.
- ""ennui"" → E N N U I → duplicate N? And we know N is only one? Not necessarily, but in guess 1, N was present once, and in guess 2 and 3, only one N. But we can avoid duplicates.

Let's list valid words:

- ""enoki"" → a type of mushroom. E N O K I → but position 4 is O? In ""enoki"", positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:K, 5:I → but we need position 4 to be O, so this has O in position 3, not 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be O, so the word must be E N ? O ? 

So position 3 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.

Examples:
- ""envoy"": E N V O Y → V in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enjoy"": E N J O Y → J in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enmity"": too long, 6 letters.
- ""enter"": E N T E R → T and R absent, and duplicate E? Not valid.
- ""euros"": E U R O S → R and S absent.
- ""ethos"": E T H O S → T and S absent.
- ""expos"": E X P O S → S absent.

Less common:
- ""enfix"": not common.
- ""enzym"": E N Z Y M → Z, Y, M.

But let's consider common words.

Another one: ""enrol"" but R absent.

""envoi"": E N V O I → similar to ""envoy"", but with I at the end. ""envoi"" is a word (a concluding stanza).

So E N V O I.

""envoy"" is E N V O Y.

Both are valid.

We also have ""ebony"", but it doesn't fit the pattern.

""elbow"" has W absent.

""endow"" we already tried, and D and W absent.

Another word: ""euros"" but R and S absent.

""ethos"" T and S absent.

""epoxy"" E P O X Y → but position 2 is P? E P O X Y → not E N ? O ? 

We need N in position 2.

So back to ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" or ""enjoy"".

""enjoy"" has J, which is less common.

""envoy"" has V and Y.

""envoi"" has V and I.

I is more common than Y.

But we don't know.

We can also consider ""ennui"" but duplicate N.

Another common word: ""enough"" → 6 letters.

""ensue"" → E N S U E → S absent and duplicate E.

Not.

So possible words: ""envoy"", ""envoi"", ""enzym"" (less common), ""enjoy"".

We should choose one that tests common letters.

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses common letters for position 3 and 5.

Common consonants: L, H, P, M, etc.

But in the pattern E N ? O ?, what words have common letters?

For example, ""enhol"" not a word.

""enmew"" not a word.

Perhaps ""eupad"" not a word.

I think ""envoy"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L or H.

""enol"" is 4 letters.

""enols"" has S absent.

""enrol"" has R absent.

""ethol"" not a word.

So ""envoy"" might be the best.

But we have another option: since we know E, N, O are fixed, we can try to solve for the remaining letters.

We have position 3 and 5 to fill.

We can guess a word that has common letters, say L and H, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""enol k"" not.

Perhaps ""belch"" not matching.

I think we have to choose from the available words.

Another word: ""euros"" not.

""educe"" E D U C E → D and C absent.

Not.

So I think ""envoy"" is a good guess.

But in ""envoy"", we have V and Y. V is not extremely common, but it's possible.

""envoi"" has V and I, which might be better because I is a vowel and more common.

""envoi"" is a valid word, meaning a concluding part of a poem.

Similarly, ""envoy"" is a messenger.

Both are acceptable.

I'll go with ""envoi"" because I is more common than Y.

But let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess ""envoi"":
- Position 1: E (should be ✓, since we know it's correct)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: V (if V is in the word, we get feedback; if not, x)
- Position 4: O (✓)
- Position 5: I (if I is in the word, we get feedback)

Similarly for ""envoy"".

But we need to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.

Since we have only two positions, and we know the word is E N ? O ?, we might even guess it.

But we don't know the letters.

Another common word: ""euros"" not.

""piano"" not matching.

I recall that ""genoa"" but G not in position 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""knoll"" not.

I think ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" are fine.

But let's choose ""envoy"" as it is more common.

To be systematic, we can list all possible words.

Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

For position 5: same, but must form a valid word.

Common words:
- envoy (V and Y)
- envoi (V and I)
- enjoy (J and Y) — J is less common
- enzym (Z and M) — less common
- enfix (F and X) — rare

Also, ""enmew"" not a word.

""enbow"" but W absent.

So between ""envoy"" and ""envoi"", I'll pick ""envoy"" because it's more familiar.

But we have feedback that might help.

We know the word is E N _ O _

With the middle letter and last letter to be guessed.

We can also consider that in the first guess, no other letters were present, and in the second, only O and E were present besides N, and in the third, only E, N, O were correct and D and W absent.

So the word has exactly three of the letters we've tested? But we tested more.

Actually, we tested C,R,A,N,E in first; O,N,S,E,T in second; E,N,D,O,W in third.

The present letters are E, N, O, and no others from the tested ones.

So the remaining two letters are from the untested set.

Untested letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need to choose two of these for positions 3 and 5.

Common combinations: for example, L and D, but D is absent.

D is absent.

So not.

H and Y? But what word?

E N H O Y? Not a word.

U and L: E N U O L? Not a word.

I and L: E N I O L? Not a word.

V and Y: E N V O Y → envoy, which is a word.

V and I: E N V O I → envoi.

So those are the only common words.

Therefore, we can guess ""envoy"".

But let's see if there is a word with H.

E N H O ? 

""enhol"" not.

""enhop"" not.

Or with G: ""engot"" not.

So I think ""envoy"" is the best choice.

We'll guess ""envoy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** 
     - C, R, A are absent (x).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""onset""):** 
     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - S and T are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""endow""):** 
     - E is correct in position 1 (✓).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - D is absent (x).
     - O is correct in position 4 (✓).
     - W is absent (x).

2. **Deductions:**
   - **Confirmed Positions:**
     - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" ✓ and ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" ✓).
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W (all marked x in previous guesses).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must be of the form `E N ? O ?`, where:
     - The third and fifth positions need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
     - The letters must be from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, S, T, D, W are eliminated).
   - **Constraints from Feedback:**
     - E cannot be in position 5 (from ""crane"" -), but this is already satisfied as E is fixed at position 1.
     - O cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" -), but this is satisfied as O is fixed at position 4.
     - N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" -), but this is satisfied as N is fixed at position 2.
   - **No Duplicates Likely:** Previous feedback showed no evidence of duplicate letters (e.g., only one N and E were ever marked), so we assume no duplicates for simplicity.

3. **Identify Possible Words:**
   - The secret word is `E N ? O ?`. We need valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern, using letters not in the absent list.
   - Common options:
     - **""envoy""**: E N V O Y (V in position 3, Y in position 5).
     - **""envoi""**: E N V O I (V in position 3, I in position 5).
     - **""enjoy""**: E N J O Y (J in position 3, Y in position 5), but J is less common.
     - Other possibilities like ""enzym"" (E N Z Y M) are rare and less ideal.
   - ""envoy"" is chosen because:
     - It uses common letters (V and Y are reasonably frequent).
     - It tests high-value positions (3 and 5) with new letters.
     - It is a familiar English word (meaning a messenger), increasing the likelihood of being valid.
     - Alternatives like ""envoi"" (less common) or ""enjoy"" (J is infrequent) are weaker.

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Resolve the two unknown positions (3 and 5) by testing V and Y.
   - **Expected Feedback:**
     - E (position 1), N (position 2), and O (position 4) will be correct (✓) again.
     - V (position 3) and Y (position 5) will provide new feedback: ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, or x if absent.
     - If ""envoy"" is incorrect, feedback will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if V or Y is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other letters like I, L, or H for the next guess).

5. **Final Decision:** ""envoy"" is the best guess to maximize information and progress toward the solution.",Guess 4: envoy -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) V(x) O(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.

I recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let's pick one that might be effective.

One suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, it contains the letter 'S' which is very common.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used as a starting word because it has a high frequency of common letters, but it may not be very common in everyday language. Another good one is ""SLATE"".

Since the instructions don't specify a word list, I'll pick a common word: ""CRANE"". 

Let me consider ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E: five distinct letters.
- Contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
- These letters are fairly common.

But note: the word ""CRANE"" might be more effective because it has a good mix. However, let me also think about ""SALET"", but that's less common.

Another option: ""RAISE"". Let's compare:
- R, A, I, S, E: three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S). Very common letters.

According to various sources, ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word. However, to be systematic, I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

But wait, I remember that in Wordle, ""CRANE"" is a valid word and often used. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good.

I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

After this guess, we'll get feedback that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

Therefore, I will output:
<guess> crane </guess>In this first guess, we have no prior information about the secret word. The goal is to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include:

1. Common letters to increase hit probability
2. A mix of vowels and consonants
3. Unique letters (no repeats) to test more positions

Based on common Wordle strategies:
- Vowels: A, E are among the most frequent
- Consonants: R, S, T, N, L, C are common
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are statistically strong openers

I choose **CRANE** because:
- Includes 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- All letters are unique
- Covering 5/26 letters tests key parts of the word
- High-frequency letters may reveal positions early

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

We also know that the secret word must contain N and E, and they are not in the positions we guessed.

We must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so this is our second try.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E (since they are in the word, but we know they are not in the 4th and 5th positions respectively).
- We should try to place N and E in different positions to find their correct locations.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since N and E are in the word, we can try to use them in positions that are not the ones we already tried (so N not in 4th, E not in 5th).

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we have to consider the positions.

Let me denote the positions as 1,2,3,4,5.

We tried:
Position 1: C (x) -> not C, and also not the letter that is actually there? But we don't know what is there.
Similarly, we know that the letter in position 1 is not C, and also not R (because R was in position 2 and is absent) and not A (position 3 absent). But we don't know what is in position 1.

We have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.

We can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.

We also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Possible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

We can try to put N and E in positions we haven't tested and also test other letters.

We also want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Let me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

Some words: 
- ""lines"": but we don't know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.

But wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.

But we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That's allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that's allowed.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.

Alternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.

Another word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E's? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E's, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don't know about duplicates. So it's possible.

But to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.

However, ""tense"" has two E's, so we might not get full information.

Another word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.

Therefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.

Similarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that's okay.

But let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that's okay.

Another word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.

We also have to avoid C, R, A.

So both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

We have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.

We have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me list some words that fit:

- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it's in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.

- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.

- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don't know.

But we also have to consider that we don't know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested before to see if they fit.

In the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.

We could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.

But we can do better.

Another word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.

Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.

So E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4
For N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5

We should try to cover new positions.

For example, we haven't tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.

In the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.

We can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.

Let me think of words that have N and E in different positions.

For instance:
- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.

- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.

- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

We must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.

So let's try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.

Word: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.

Word: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.

Another word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.

Word: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)
- We test I, L, T.

This seems valid.

Word: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. 
- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.

Also valid.

Word: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.

But we don't know if U is common.

Word: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.

All these are similar.

Another word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. 
- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.

But note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay to test E in position 4.

Similarly, N in position 3 is okay.

We could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.

For example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.

Word: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, Y is less common.

Word: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.

Word: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.

We must avoid N in position 4.

So let's try to put E in position 1.

Word: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.

Word: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.

Word: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.

We need both N and E.

Word: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. 
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N in position 2 (allowed)
- Tests D, O, W.

This is valid.

Similarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.

""inlet"" tests I, L, T
""onset"" tests O, S, T
""dines"" tests D, I, S
""endow"" tests D, O, W

S and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.

""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.

But we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.

We can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.

Similarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.

But we don't know what is in those positions.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven't tried and that are common.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.

We should test three new letters that are common.

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.

So we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.

""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.

""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.

""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.

""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.

""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don't know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.

But note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it's okay.

But we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.

So ""tones"" is also a candidate.

But let me compare:

- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.
- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Both are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.

Similarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

We could choose any.

But we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That's different, so it's good to test a new position.

Similarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.

In ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.

In ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.

In ""dines"", N is in position 3.

In ""inlet"", N is in position 2.

All are new positions.

I think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven't tested before (N in 2, E in 4).

We haven't tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn't tell us about the letter that is actually there.

Similarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.

Position 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.

Position 4 had N (but we know it's not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.

Similarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.

So ""onset"" tests:
- Position 1: O (new)
- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it's in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it's present but wrong position)
- Position 3: S (new)
- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)
- Position 5: T (new)

This should give us a lot of information.

Similarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.

But in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.

I think both are fine.

I'll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.

L and I are also common, but S is common in both.

But ""onset"" has T, which is very common.

I think ""onset"" is a solid choice.

So I will guess ""onset"".

But let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.

So, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).
- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).

After evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:
- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.
- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).
- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.
- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed letters:
   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).

2. Present letters (but wrong position):
   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).

3. Absent letters:
   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.

4. Therefore, the secret word has:
   - Position 2: N
   - E in position 1 or 3
   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)

Also, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure so far:

Position 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).
Position 2: N (fixed)
Position 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.
Position 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).
Position 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).

But we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T

So we must avoid these.

Now, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.

Since there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.

We have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _

With E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).

Also, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.

We need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.

We should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.

First, let's list the possibilities for E:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word is: E N _ _ _
And E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.

Actually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word is: _ N E _ _
And O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).

We can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We should choose a word that can test these cases.

We also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.

Letters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to form words that fit the constraints.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.

For example, possible words: 
- E N O _ _ 
- E N _ O _
- E N _ _ O

But we don't know the other letters.

Similarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.

We should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.

Let me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.

But we don't know where E is.

We could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it's correct.

Or we could put E in position 3.

But we also need to test other letters.

Another idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.

For example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.

Or ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven't tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.

But we don't know if D and W are in the word.

But we can use this to test.

However, we must avoid S, T, etc.

""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.

But let's see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.

Similarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.

But we know E is either in 1 or 3.

So if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.

Specifically:
- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).

Similarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.

Also, we test D and W.

But D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.

Another word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.

""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don't know about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it's correct.

Important: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it's confirmed. So position 2 must be N.

So the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?

With the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.

So we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.

Therefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.

So the guess must have N as the second letter.

So we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

And we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.

Now, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.

We know that E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.

But if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.

If we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.

We should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.

For example, if we put E in position 1, then:
- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.
- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).

Similarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:
- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.
- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).

But we can also put O in a position that might be likely.

Since we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

The word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.

Possible words:

- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _
  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.
  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? 
    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W
    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid
    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y
  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O
    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.
    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don't know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.
    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.

- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _
  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? 
    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.
    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it's 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.

We need to have N in position 2.

So for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

And O must be in letter4 or letter5.

For example:
- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid
  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E. We need E in position 3.
  - We need E in position 3, so: [letter1] N E O [letter5]
    - ""kneop"" not a word.
    - ""aneos"" not a word.
    - Common words: ""video"" but V, I, D, E, O -> positions: V1, I2, D3, E4, O5 -> not matching, we need position 2 to be N and position 3 to be E.

It's hard to find words with E in position 3 and O in position 4.

Perhaps: ""bneou"" not a word.

Another one: ""sneop"" not a word.

Maybe ""joe"" is three letters.

Perhaps it's rare.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
  - e.g., ""fineo"" not a word.
  - ""mineo"" not common.
  - ""lineo"" not a word.
  - ""pineo"" not a word.
  - ""wineo"" not a word.

Common word: ""cameo"" but C is absent, and positions: C1, A2, M3, E4, O5 -> not matching.

"" cameo"" has A and C absent.

Perhaps ""dicey"" but not.

It seems difficult to find common words with E in position 3 and O in position 5.

Another possibility: ""foyer"" but R absent, and positions: F1, O2, Y3, E4, R5 -> not matching.

Perhaps E in position 3 is less common.

Maybe the word has E in position 1.

Let's go back to the case with E in position 1.

Then we have words like E N ? ? ?

With O in one of the last three positions.

And we need to fill with two other letters.

Common words:
- E N D O W (endow)
- E N V O Y (envoy)
- E N I G M (enigm, not common)
- E N O L S (enols, but S absent)
- E N T E R (but T absent and duplicate E)

So ""endow"" and ""envoy"" are candidates.

""endow"" has D, O, W
""envoy"" has V, O, Y

Both avoid the absent letters.

Now, for the case where E is in position 3, we might find words like:

- U N E A R (but A and R absent)
- I N E P T (T absent)
- O N E R Y (R absent, and O in position 1? But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)

From guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.

So for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.

And letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.

Possible words:
- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.
- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.
- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.
- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.
- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.
- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.
- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.
- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.

With O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O
- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.
- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.
- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.
- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.
- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.
- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.

It's hard to find common words with E in position 3.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.

Or ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.

I think it's more likely that E is in position 1.

Therefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".

But we can also choose a word that works for both cases.

Another idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.

For example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?

With ? being common letters.

For instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.

""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.

""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2? J1, O2, K3, E4, D5 -> not E in 3.

It's difficult.

""pined"" P I N E D -> positions:1:P, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D -> position 3 is N, not E.

We need a word with the pattern: [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]

Common words: 
- ""ankle"" A N K L E -> but A absent, and position 2 is N, position 3 is K, not E.
- ""apple"" A P P L E -> A absent, duplicate P.
- ""aisle"" A I S L E -> A and S absent.
- ""oxide"" O X I D E -> O in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1, so invalid.
- ""exile"" E X I L E -> duplicate E, and position 1 is E, but we are testing E in position 3? Not.

Perhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.

I think it's challenging.

Maybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.

Not.

So perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.

So we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.

For example, ""endow"".

""endow"" is E N D O W.

This tests:
- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).
- N in position 2: we know it's correct, so we get ✓.
- D in position 3: new letter.
- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).
- W in position 5: new letter.

This will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.

If we are lucky, we might even guess the word.

Another option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.

But V and Y are less common.

""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.

But let's choose ""endow"".

We have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.

""eclat"" has C and A absent.

So ""endow"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.

Must include E.

So I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""endow"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)
- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).
   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.

3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:
   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.
   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).
   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.
- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.
- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.
- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:
  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).
  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).
  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.
  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.

### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":
- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.
- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).
- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.
- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).

<guess>endow</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)
Guess 3: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
  - C, R, A are absent.
  - N is present but not in position 4.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)
  - O is present but not in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - S is absent.
  - E is present but not in position 4.
  - T is absent.

Guess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)
  - E is correct in position 1.
  - N is correct in position 2.
  - D is absent.
  - O is correct in position 4.
  - W is absent.

Now, from this feedback, we can deduce:

1. **Correct letters in known positions:**
   - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" feedback)
   - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" and confirmed in ""endow"")
   - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" feedback)

2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W are not in the word.

3. **Present letters from previous feedback:**
   - We know E, N, O are in the word and now we know their positions: E in 1, N in 2, O in 4.

4. **Word structure so far:**
   - The secret word is: E N _ O _
   - We need to fill positions 3 and 5.

5. **Constraints for positions 3 and 5:**
   - The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, W.
   - We have two letters to determine.

6. **Additional information:**
   - From guess 1, we know that N is not in position 4 (but we now know it's in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but we now know it's in position 1). So no new constraints for positions 3 and 5 from that.
   - From guess 2, we know O is not in position 1 (but now in 4) and E is not in position 4 (now in 1). Also, S and T are absent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form E N ? O ? 

The missing letters (position 3 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.

Absent letters: A, C, D, R, S, T, W

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we should focus on common letters.

We have two positions to fill, and we need to guess a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Possible common letters for position 3 and 5: L, I, U, M, P, H, etc.

We can list possible words that fit E N ? O ? 

For example:
- E N I O R → but R is absent.
- E N O O ? → duplicate O? But we don't know if O is duplicated. However, in ""endow"", O was in position 4 and marked correct, so if there were two O's, we might have seen it? But in ""onset"", O was in position 1 and marked present but wrong position, but we now know O is in position 4. Since we haven't seen a second O marked, it's possible but less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Common words:
- ""enrol"" → E N R O L → but R is absent and L in position 5? Also, R absent.
- ""envoy"" → E N V O Y → V and Y. We haven't tried V or Y. But in guess 3, we tried ""endow"" and D and W were absent, so V and Y are possible.
- ""ebony"" → E B O N Y → but position 2 is B? No, we have E B O N Y, so position 3 is O? But we need position 4 to be O, and in ""ebony"", position 4 is N, which is already in position 2. So not matching.
- ""elbow"" → E L B O W → but W is absent (from guess 3).
- ""endue"" → E N D U E → D absent and duplicate E? Not good.
- ""ennui"" → E N N U I → duplicate N? And we know N is only one? Not necessarily, but in guess 1, N was present once, and in guess 2 and 3, only one N. But we can avoid duplicates.

Let's list valid words:

- ""enoki"" → a type of mushroom. E N O K I → but position 4 is O? In ""enoki"", positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:K, 5:I → but we need position 4 to be O, so this has O in position 3, not 4. So not matching.

We need position 4 to be O, so the word must be E N ? O ? 

So position 3 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.

Examples:
- ""envoy"": E N V O Y → V in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enjoy"": E N J O Y → J in position 3, Y in position 5.
- ""enmity"": too long, 6 letters.
- ""enter"": E N T E R → T and R absent, and duplicate E? Not valid.
- ""euros"": E U R O S → R and S absent.
- ""ethos"": E T H O S → T and S absent.
- ""expos"": E X P O S → S absent.

Less common:
- ""enfix"": not common.
- ""enzym"": E N Z Y M → Z, Y, M.

But let's consider common words.

Another one: ""enrol"" but R absent.

""envoi"": E N V O I → similar to ""envoy"", but with I at the end. ""envoi"" is a word (a concluding stanza).

So E N V O I.

""envoy"" is E N V O Y.

Both are valid.

We also have ""ebony"", but it doesn't fit the pattern.

""elbow"" has W absent.

""endow"" we already tried, and D and W absent.

Another word: ""euros"" but R and S absent.

""ethos"" T and S absent.

""epoxy"" E P O X Y → but position 2 is P? E P O X Y → not E N ? O ? 

We need N in position 2.

So back to ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" or ""enjoy"".

""enjoy"" has J, which is less common.

""envoy"" has V and Y.

""envoi"" has V and I.

I is more common than Y.

But we don't know.

We can also consider ""ennui"" but duplicate N.

Another common word: ""enough"" → 6 letters.

""ensue"" → E N S U E → S absent and duplicate E.

Not.

So possible words: ""envoy"", ""envoi"", ""enzym"" (less common), ""enjoy"".

We should choose one that tests common letters.

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses common letters for position 3 and 5.

Common consonants: L, H, P, M, etc.

But in the pattern E N ? O ?, what words have common letters?

For example, ""enhol"" not a word.

""enmew"" not a word.

Perhaps ""eupad"" not a word.

I think ""envoy"" is a reasonable choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L or H.

""enol"" is 4 letters.

""enols"" has S absent.

""enrol"" has R absent.

""ethol"" not a word.

So ""envoy"" might be the best.

But we have another option: since we know E, N, O are fixed, we can try to solve for the remaining letters.

We have position 3 and 5 to fill.

We can guess a word that has common letters, say L and H, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""enol k"" not.

Perhaps ""belch"" not matching.

I think we have to choose from the available words.

Another word: ""euros"" not.

""educe"" E D U C E → D and C absent.

Not.

So I think ""envoy"" is a good guess.

But in ""envoy"", we have V and Y. V is not extremely common, but it's possible.

""envoi"" has V and I, which might be better because I is a vowel and more common.

""envoi"" is a valid word, meaning a concluding part of a poem.

Similarly, ""envoy"" is a messenger.

Both are acceptable.

I'll go with ""envoi"" because I is more common than Y.

But let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess ""envoi"":
- Position 1: E (should be ✓, since we know it's correct)
- Position 2: N (✓)
- Position 3: V (if V is in the word, we get feedback; if not, x)
- Position 4: O (✓)
- Position 5: I (if I is in the word, we get feedback)

Similarly for ""envoy"".

But we need to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.

Since we have only two positions, and we know the word is E N ? O ?, we might even guess it.

But we don't know the letters.

Another common word: ""euros"" not.

""piano"" not matching.

I recall that ""genoa"" but G not in position 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""knoll"" not.

I think ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" are fine.

But let's choose ""envoy"" as it is more common.

To be systematic, we can list all possible words.

Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

For position 5: same, but must form a valid word.

Common words:
- envoy (V and Y)
- envoi (V and I)
- enjoy (J and Y) — J is less common
- enzym (Z and M) — less common
- enfix (F and X) — rare

Also, ""enmew"" not a word.

""enbow"" but W absent.

So between ""envoy"" and ""envoi"", I'll pick ""envoy"" because it's more familiar.

But we have feedback that might help.

We know the word is E N _ O _

With the middle letter and last letter to be guessed.

We can also consider that in the first guess, no other letters were present, and in the second, only O and E were present besides N, and in the third, only E, N, O were correct and D and W absent.

So the word has exactly three of the letters we've tested? But we tested more.

Actually, we tested C,R,A,N,E in first; O,N,S,E,T in second; E,N,D,O,W in third.

The present letters are E, N, O, and no others from the tested ones.

So the remaining two letters are from the untested set.

Untested letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need to choose two of these for positions 3 and 5.

Common combinations: for example, L and D, but D is absent.

D is absent.

So not.

H and Y? But what word?

E N H O Y? Not a word.

U and L: E N U O L? Not a word.

I and L: E N I O L? Not a word.

V and Y: E N V O Y → envoy, which is a word.

V and I: E N V O I → envoi.

So those are the only common words.

Therefore, we can guess ""envoy"".

But let's see if there is a word with H.

E N H O ? 

""enhol"" not.

""enhop"" not.

Or with G: ""engot"" not.

So I think ""envoy"" is the best choice.

We'll guess ""envoy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** 
     - C, R, A are absent (x).
     - N is present but not in position 4 (-).
     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""onset""):** 
     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - S and T are absent (x).
     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""endow""):** 
     - E is correct in position 1 (✓).
     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).
     - D is absent (x).
     - O is correct in position 4 (✓).
     - W is absent (x).

2. **Deductions:**
   - **Confirmed Positions:**
     - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" ✓ and ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" ✓).
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W (all marked x in previous guesses).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must be of the form `E N ? O ?`, where:
     - The third and fifth positions need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.
     - The letters must be from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, S, T, D, W are eliminated).
   - **Constraints from Feedback:**
     - E cannot be in position 5 (from ""crane"" -), but this is already satisfied as E is fixed at position 1.
     - O cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" -), but this is satisfied as O is fixed at position 4.
     - N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" -), but this is satisfied as N is fixed at position 2.
   - **No Duplicates Likely:** Previous feedback showed no evidence of duplicate letters (e.g., only one N and E were ever marked), so we assume no duplicates for simplicity.

3. **Identify Possible Words:**
   - The secret word is `E N ? O ?`. We need valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern, using letters not in the absent list.
   - Common options:
     - **""envoy""**: E N V O Y (V in position 3, Y in position 5).
     - **""envoi""**: E N V O I (V in position 3, I in position 5).
     - **""enjoy""**: E N J O Y (J in position 3, Y in position 5), but J is less common.
     - Other possibilities like ""enzym"" (E N Z Y M) are rare and less ideal.
   - ""envoy"" is chosen because:
     - It uses common letters (V and Y are reasonably frequent).
     - It tests high-value positions (3 and 5) with new letters.
     - It is a familiar English word (meaning a messenger), increasing the likelihood of being valid.
     - Alternatives like ""envoi"" (less common) or ""enjoy"" (J is infrequent) are weaker.

4. **Strategy for This Guess:**
   - **Goal:** Resolve the two unknown positions (3 and 5) by testing V and Y.
   - **Expected Feedback:**
     - E (position 1), N (position 2), and O (position 4) will be correct (✓) again.
     - V (position 3) and Y (position 5) will provide new feedback: ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, or x if absent.
     - If ""envoy"" is incorrect, feedback will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if V or Y is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other letters like I, L, or H for the next guess).

5. **Final Decision:** ""envoy"" is the best guess to maximize information and progress toward the solution.

We need to make the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids repeats. Common vowels and consonants are important.\n\nI recall that some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"" because they have a mix of common letters. However, let\'s pick one that might be effective.\n\nOne suggestion is to use words with unique letters and a mix of common vowels and consonants. The word ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, it contains the letter \'S\' which is very common.\n\nAlternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word that is sometimes used as a starting word because it has a high frequency of common letters, but it may not be very common in everyday language. Another good one is ""SLATE"".\n\nSince the instructions don\'t specify a word list, I\'ll pick a common word: ""CRANE"". \n\nLet me consider ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, A, N, E: five distinct letters.\n- Contains two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n- These letters are fairly common.\n\nBut note: the word ""CRANE"" might be more effective because it has a good mix.

But we don\'t know what is in position 1.\n\nWe have to choose a word that includes N and E, and avoids C, R, A.\n\nWe can also try to use other common letters to get more coverage.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nWe should avoid repeating the same letters unless necessary, but we know we must include N and E.\n\nWe also note that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.\n\nPossible positions for N: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\nPossible positions for E: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\nWe can try to put N and E in positions we haven\'t tested and also test other letters.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by testing new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.\n\nSome words: \n- ""lines"": but we don\'t know if L, I, S are in the word? But we can use it to test. However, note that we have to avoid C, R, A. ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. No C, R, A. But we have 5 letters, so ""lines"" is 5 letters.\n\nBut wait, we have feedback that N is in the word but not in position 4. In ""lines"", N is in position 3? Let me spell: L-I-N-E-S -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S.\n\nBut we know that E is in the word but not in position 5? Actually, in ""lines"", E is in position 4. That\'s allowed because we only know E is not in position 5. Similarly, N is in position 3, which is not 4, so that\'s allowed.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing new letters: L, I, S.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W. Positions: 1:S, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:W. But note that E is in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). But we are testing S, I, W.\n\nAnother word: ""tense"": T-E-N-S-E. But this has two E\'s? Actually, it has E at position 2 and 5. But we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one E and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guessed one E, it would show as present, but we don\'t know about duplicates. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, maybe we should stick to words with unique letters until we have more information.\n\nHowever, ""tense"" has two E\'s, so we might not get full information.\n\nAnother word: ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, we know that N is in the word but not in position 4. If we put N in position 4, that would be the same position we tried before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting N in position 4. Similarly, E in position 5: we know E is not in position 5. So we cannot put E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""spine"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we must avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, ""lines"" has E in position 4 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (allowed). So that\'s okay.\n\nBut let me check: in ""lines"", position 4 is E. We know E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is okay. Position 3 is N, and we know N is not in position 4, but position 3 is different, so that\'s okay.\n\nAnother word: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. This puts N in position 2 (allowed) and E in position 4 (allowed). And we test I, L, T.\n\nWe also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\nSo both ""lines"" and ""inlet"" are candidates.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe have 5 positions. We know two letters that must be in the word: N and E. So we have to use them. The other three letters should be new and common.\n\nWe have already eliminated C, R, A. So we have 23 letters left? But we are going to use two of them (N and E) again, so we can test three new ones.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n\n- ""tones"": T-O-N-E-S. But note: positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. We know E is not in position 5? Here it\'s in position 4, which is okay. N is in position 3, okay. But we are testing T, O, S.\n\n- ""tunes"": T-U-N-E-S. Positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. Same as above, but with U instead of O.\n\n- ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S. But B is less common? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we don\'t know the positions of N and E. We should try to put them in positions we haven\'t tested before to see if they fit.\n\nIn the first guess, we had N in position 4 and E in position 5. Now we are trying N in position 3 and E in position 4? That might be okay, but we are not testing position 1 or 2 for N and E.\n\nWe could try putting N in position 1 and E in position 2, for example.\n\nWord: ""newly"": N-E-W-L-Y. But that has Y, which is less common. Also, we are testing W, L, Y.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAnother word: ""nudge"": N-U-D-G-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we know E is not in position 5? We have E in position 5, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""nudge"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid position 5 for E and position 4 for N.\n\nSo E cannot be in position 5, and N cannot be in position 4.\n\nTherefore, for E, allowed positions: 1,2,3,4\nFor N, allowed positions: 1,2,3,5\n\nWe should try to cover new positions.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested N in position 1,2,3,5 and E in 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the first guess, we tested N in 4 (wrong) and E in 5 (wrong). So we have no information about positions 1,2,3 for both.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and E in position 2? Or N in position 5 and E in position 1, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that have N and E in different positions.\n\nFor instance:\n- ""noise"": N-O-I-S-E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. So invalid.\n\n- ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But N is in position 4 (not allowed) and E in position 5 (not allowed). Invalid.\n\n- ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. Positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E. Again, N in 4 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.\n\nWe must avoid having N in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\nSo let\'s try to put N in position 1 and E in position 3? For example.\n\nWord: ""needs"": but has duplicate E? N-E-E-D-S. Duplicate E, and E in position 2 and 5? Position 5 is not allowed for E. So invalid.\n\nWord: ""nerdy"": N-E-R-D-Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word because in the first guess, R was in position 2 and marked x (absent). So we cannot use R. We must avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, A.\n\nSo ""nerdy"" has R, which is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""noble"": N-O-B-L-E. Positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E. But E is in position 5? Not allowed. Invalid.\n\nWord: ""nymph"": N-Y-M-P-H. But no E? We must include E because it is in the word. So we have to include E.\n\nSo we need a word that has both N and E.\n\nWord: ""inlet"": I-N-L-E-T. Positions: 1:I, 2:N, 3:L, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N is in position 2 (allowed, since not 4)\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since not 5)\n- We test I, L, T.\n\nThis seems valid.\n\nWord: ""onset"": O-N-S-E-T. Positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. \n- N in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests O, S, T.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nWord: ""unset"": U-N-S-E-T. Similar to above.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is common.\n\nWord: ""inset"": I-N-S-E-T. Same as above but with I.\n\nAll these are similar.\n\nAnother word: ""dines"": D-I-N-E-S. Positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. \n- N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok). Tests D, I, S.\n\nBut note that in ""dines"", E is in position 4, which is the same position we are testing? But we know E is not in position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay to test E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, N in position 3 is okay.\n\nWe could also try to put E in a different position, like position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, word: ""elint"" - not a word? Not valid.\n\nWord: ""enemy"": E-N-E-M-Y. Duplicate E? And E in position 1 and 3? But we have duplicate, and we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, Y is less common.\n\nWord: ""enter"": E-N-T-E-R. Duplicate E, and R is forbidden (we know R is absent). So invalid.\n\nWord: ""event"": E-V-E-N-T. Duplicate E, and E in position 1 and 3? Also, we are putting N in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, it would be wrong. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N in position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to put E in position 1.\n\nWord: ""eclat"" - but has C and A, which are forbidden. Also, C and A are absent.\n\nWord: ""edify"": E-D-I-F-Y. But no N? We must include N.\n\nWord: ""elbow"": E-L-B-O-W. No N.\n\nWe need both N and E.\n\nWord: ""endow"": E-N-D-O-W. Positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W. \n- E in position 1 (allowed)\n- N in position 2 (allowed)\n- Tests D, O, W.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""inlet"", ""onset"", ""dines"", ""endow"" are all candidates.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, N (but N we know), E we know. So we should test S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n""inlet"" tests I, L, T\n""onset"" tests O, S, T\n""dines"" tests D, I, S\n""endow"" tests D, O, W\n\nS and T are very common, so ""onset"" or ""dines"" might be good.\n\n""onset"" has O, S, T. O is a vowel, which might be common.\n\nBut we already know that the word has E and N, so vowels are partially covered.\n\nWe can also consider that we have no information about the first letter. We tried C and it was absent, so we can try a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, we have no information about position 2,3,4,5 except that position 4 is not N and position 5 is not E.\n\nBut we don\'t know what is in those positions.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that has letters we haven\'t tried and that are common.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo we have 21 letters left to test? But we are reusing N and E.\n\nWe should test three new letters that are common.\n\nThe most common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... but we have eliminated A and R, and we know E and N are in.\n\nSo we should test T, O, I, S, L, D, etc.\n\n""onset"" uses O, N, S, E, T -> new letters: O, S, T. All common.\n\n""inlet"" uses I, N, L, E, T -> new: I, L, T.\n\n""tones"" uses T, O, N, E, S -> but we cannot use ""tones"" because it has N in position 3 and E in position 4, which is allowed, but we are testing T, O, S. However, we already considered ""onset"", which is similar.\n\n""onset"" is O-N-S-E-T.\n\n""tones"" is T-O-N-E-S, but that has E in position 4 and S in position 5? But we know that position 5 is not E, but it could be S? We don\'t know. But in ""tones"", we have E in position 4 (ok) and N in position 3 (ok). But the word ""tones"" is valid.\n\nBut note: in ""tones"", the letter S is in position 5. We have no information about position 5, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid using E in position 5, which we are not.\n\nSo ""tones"" is also a candidate.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n- ""onset"": O in position 1, N in 2, S in 3, E in 4, T in 5.\n- ""tones"": T in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBoth are valid and test the same set of letters: O, S, T, and reuse N and E.\n\nSimilarly, ""dines"": D in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nWe could choose any.\n\nBut we might want to avoid having E in the same position as before? In the first guess, E was in position 5, now we are putting it in position 4. That\'s different, so it\'s good to test a new position.\n\nSimilarly, N was in position 4, now we are putting it in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nIn ""onset"", N is in position 2, which is new.\n\nIn ""tones"", N is in position 3, which is new.\n\nIn ""dines"", N is in position 3.\n\nIn ""inlet"", N is in position 2.\n\nAll are new positions.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a good choice because it tests O, S, T, which are common, and it puts N and E in positions we haven\'t tested before (N in 2, E in 4).\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 2 for any letter? We know R was in position 2 and was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about the letter that is actually there.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 had C (absent), so we are testing O in position 1.\n\nPosition 3 had A (absent), so we are testing S in position 3.\n\nPosition 4 had N (but we know it\'s not N, so we are testing E in position 4? But we know E is in the word, so if E is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or x.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 had E (absent in that position), so we are testing T in position 5.\n\nSo ""onset"" tests:\n- Position 1: O (new)\n- Position 2: N (we know N is in the word, so if it\'s in position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus because it\'s present but wrong position)\n- Position 3: S (new)\n- Position 4: E (if E is in position 4, check; else minus)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nThis should give us a lot of information.\n\nSimilarly, ""tones"" would test T in position 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut in ""onset"", we are testing position 1 with O, which is a vowel, and position 5 with T, a consonant.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""onset"" because it starts with a vowel, which might be less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""lines"", but ""lines"" has L, I, N, E, S. We test L and I instead of O and T.\n\nL and I are also common, but S is common in both.\n\nBut ""onset"" has T, which is very common.\n\nI think ""onset"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo I will guess ""onset"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""onset"" is a valid English word? Yes, meaning the beginning or start.\n\nSo, next guess: onset.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, we need a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes N and E (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoids C, R, A (since they are absent).\n- Places N in a position other than 4 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5).\n- Places E in a position other than 5 (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 4).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, O, L, I).\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""inlet"", ""dines"", ""tones"", and ""onset"", ""onset"" is chosen because:\n- It contains N (position 2) and E (position 4), both in new untested positions.\n- It tests three new common letters: O (position 1), S (position 3), and T (position 5).\n- It avoids C, R, A and uses distinct letters.\n- The word is valid and provides good coverage of positions and common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""onset""\n- O: - (in the word, but not in position 1)\n- N: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. Confirmed letters:\n   - N is in the word and in position 2 (since we got a ✓ for N in position 2).\n\n2. Present letters (but wrong position):\n   - E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since the word has 5 positions, E must be in position 1 or 3 (because position 2 is taken by N).\n   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess). So O must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (but note position 2 is taken by N).\n\n3. Absent letters:\n   - C, R, A, S, T are not in the word.\n\n4. Therefore, the secret word has:\n   - Position 2: N\n   - E in position 1 or 3\n   - O in position 3, 4, or 5 (but cannot be in position 1, and position 2 is taken)\n\nAlso, note that E and O are both present, so they must be in the remaining positions.\n\nNow, the word structure so far:\n\nPosition 1: Either E or another letter (but if E is not in position 1, then E must be in position 3, and position 1 is a new letter).\nPosition 2: N (fixed)\nPosition 3: Could be E (if not in 1) or O or another letter, but note that if E is in position 1, then position 3 is open, and if E is in position 3, then position 1 is open.\nPosition 4: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 4).\nPosition 5: Could be O or another letter (but not E, because E is not in position 5).\n\nBut we also know that O is present and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T (with C,R,A,S,T absent; N,E,O present).\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, S, T\n\nSo we must avoid these.\n\nNow, we know the word has at least three letters: N (in pos2), E, and O.\n\nSince there are 5 positions, we need two more letters.\n\nWe have to find a word that fits: _ N _ _ _\n\nWith E in either position 1 or 3, and O in one of 3,4,5 (but if E is in 3, then O cannot be in 3, so O in 4 or 5; if E is not in 3, then O can be in 3,4,5).\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, R, A, S, T.\n\nWe need to make a guess that helps us determine the positions of E and O and the other two letters.\n\nWe should try to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\nFirst, let\'s list the possibilities for E:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1.\nThen the word is: E N _ _ _\nAnd E is fixed in pos1. Then O must be in pos3,4, or5. And we have two more letters to fill pos3,4,5 (if O is in one of them) or all three if O is not in one of them? But O is present, so it must be in one of 3,4,5.\n\nActually, the word has E, N, O, and two other letters.\n\nCase 2: E in position 3.\nThen the word is: _ N E _ _\nAnd O must be in pos4 or pos5 (since pos3 is taken by E).\n\nWe can also consider that we might have duplicates? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe should choose a word that can test these cases.\n\nWe also want to test common letters that are not yet tried.\n\nLetters not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon ones: L, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words that fit the constraints.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 1, then the word is E N _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill positions 3,4,5 with O and two other letters, one of which is O.\n\nFor example, possible words: \n- E N O _ _ \n- E N _ O _\n- E N _ _ O\n\nBut we don\'t know the other letters.\n\nSimilarly, if E is in position 3, then _ N E _ _ and O in 4 or 5.\n\nWe should make a guess that can distinguish between these cases and also test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that have N in position 2 and include E and O.\n\nBut we don\'t know where E is.\n\nWe could try to put E in position 1 in our guess to see if it\'s correct.\n\nOr we could put E in position 3.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know N is fixed in position 2, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and O in a different position, and also test other common letters.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""enjoy"": E N J O Y. But J and Y are less common.\n\nOr ""endow"": but we know T is absent? ""endow"" has D, O, W. But we haven\'t tried D, O, W. However, in the second guess, we tried O and it was present (but wrong position), so O is in the word. But ""endow"" has E in position 1, N in 2, D in 3, O in 4, W in 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D and W are in the word.\n\nBut we can use this to test.\n\nHowever, we must avoid S, T, etc.\n\n""endow"" avoids C,R,A,S,T.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback for ""onset"" told us O is present but not in position 1, so if we put O in position 4, that might be good.\n\nSimilarly, E in position 1: if E is actually in position 1, we get a ✓; if not, we get a minus.\n\nBut we know E is either in 1 or 3.\n\nSo if we guess ""endow"", we can get information about E and O.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If E is in position 1, we get ✓ for E in pos1.\n- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for E in pos1 (since E is present but wrong position).\n\nSimilarly, O is in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if O is in position 3 or 5, we get a minus.\n\nAlso, we test D and W.\n\nBut D and W are not very common; we might want to test more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""embed"": but has B and D, and E in position 1? But also, it has M? E M B E D? Duplicate E? Not good.\n\n""elope"": E L O P E? Duplicate E, and P. But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n""elbow"": E L B O W. Positions: E in 1, L in 2? But position 2 is N, so we cannot put L in position 2 because we know N is fixed there. In our guess, we must have N in position 2 because it\'s correct.\n\nImportant: in the next guess, we must keep N in position 2 because it\'s confirmed. So position 2 must be N.\n\nSo the guess must have the form: ? N ? ? ?\n\nWith the first ? being a letter for position 1, etc.\n\nSo we cannot change position 2; it has to be N.\n\nTherefore, for ""elbow"", it would be E L B O W, but position 2 is L, which is not N, so that would be wrong. We must have N in position 2.\n\nSo the guess must have N as the second letter.\n\nSo we are guessing: [letter1] N [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd we know letter1 and letter3 are candidates for E? Or other letters.\n\nNow, we need to choose letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5.\n\nWe know that E must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, O must be in position 3,4, or5.\n\nBut if we put E in position 1, then position 3 cannot be E (assuming no duplicates), so O can be in 3,4,5.\n\nIf we put E in position 3, then position 1 is not E, and O can be in 4 or5.\n\nWe should choose a guess that helps us determine where E and O are.\n\nFor example, if we put E in position 1, then:\n- If E is actually in position 1, we get ✓ for position 1.\n- If not, then E must be in position 3, so we get a minus for position 1 (since E is present but not here).\n\nSimilarly, if we put O in position 4, for example, then:\n- If O is in position 4, we get ✓.\n- If not, we get a minus (since O is present but not in 4).\n\nBut we can also put O in a position that might be likely.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should also test other common letters.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.\n\nThe word must contain E and O, and have N in position 2.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- If E in 1: then words like E N _ _ _\n  - With O in 3: e.g., E N O _ _ -> possible: ""enols"" (but S is absent), ""enols"" has S, which is absent. Not allowed.\n  - With O in 4: e.g., E N ? O ? \n    - ""endow"" (D, O, W) -> E N D O W\n    - ""enrol"" (but R is absent) -> invalid\n    - ""envoy"" (V, O, Y) -> E N V O Y\n  - With O in 5: e.g., E N ? ? O\n    - ""endue"" (D, U, E) but duplicate E? E N D U E -> duplicate, not good.\n    - ""ennui"" (N, U, I) but duplicate N? E N N U I -> duplicate N, and we don\'t know if N is duplicated. But in first guess, N was present once, so maybe not duplicated. Avoid.\n    - ""ebony"" (B, O, N, Y) but N duplicate? E B O N Y -> position 2 is B? No, we must have N in position 2. So ""ebony"" is E B O N Y, so position 2 is B, not N. Invalid.\n\n- If E in 3: then words like _ N E _ _\n  - With O in 4: e.g., ? N E O ? \n    - ""one"" is three letters, not five.\n    - ""dined"" but D and D, duplicate? D I N E D -> duplicate D, and positions: D in1, N in2, E in3, D in5? But we need 5 letters. ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so position 1:D, 2:N, 3:E, 4:? Wait, it\'s 5 letters: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D? No, ""dined"" is D-I-N-E-D, so positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 2 to be N, so if we have ""dined"", position 2 is I, not N. So invalid for our pattern.\n\nWe need to have N in position 2.\n\nSo for E in 3: the pattern is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAnd O must be in letter4 or letter5.\n\nFor example:\n- O in 4: [letter1] N E O [letter5]\n  - e.g., ""inept"" (I, N, E, P, T) but T is absent -> invalid\n  - ""unfed"" (U, N, F, E, D) but E is in position 4? Pattern: U N F E D -> position 3 is F, not E.

But O is present, but in ""onery"", O is in position 1, but we know O is not in position 1 from guess2 feedback)\n\nFrom guess2, O is not in position 1, so in the secret word, O cannot be in position 1.\n\nSo for E in position 3, the word is [letter1] N E [letter4] [letter5] with letter1 not O (since O not in 1), and O in 4 or 5.\n\nAnd letter1 cannot be C,R,A,S,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- B N E O ?  (O in 4) -> ""bnebo"" not a word.\n- D N E O ?  ""dnebo"" not a word.\n- G N E O ?  ""gnebo"" not a word.\n- H N E O ?  ""hnebo"" not a word.\n- L N E O ?  ""lnebo"" not a word.\n- M N E O ?  ""mnebo"" not a word.\n- P N E O ?  ""pnebo"" not a word.\n- U N E O ?  ""uneo"" not five letters.\n\nWith O in 5: [letter1] N E [letter4] O\n- ""dunno"" D U N N O -> duplicate N, and position 2 is N, position 3 is N? ""dunno"" is D-U-N-N-O, so positions:1:D, 2:U, 3:N, 4:N, 5:O -> position 2 is U, not N. Invalid.\n- ""bingo"" B I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.\n- ""bongo"" B O N G O -> position 2 is O, not N, and duplicate O.\n- ""lingo"" L I N G O -> position 3 is N, not E.\n- ""mango"" M A N G O -> A absent.\n- ""tango"" T A N G O -> T and A absent.\n- ""bento"" B E N T O -> T absent, and positions: B1, E2, N3, T4, O5 -> not position 2 for N.\n\nIt\'s hard to find common words with E in position 3.\n\nPerhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> not matching.\n\nOr ""bagel"" B A G E L -> A absent, and E in position 4.\n\nI think it\'s more likely that E is in position 1.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess, we can assume E in position 1 and test ""endow"" or ""envoy"".\n\nBut we can also choose a word that works for both cases.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has E in position 3 to directly test if E is in position 3.\n\nFor example, guess a word like: ? N E ? ?\n\nWith ? being common letters.\n\nFor instance, ""unfed"" but F, E, D, and position 3 is F, not E.\n\nWe need position 3 to be E.\n\n""  ""unpeg"" U N P E G -> positions:1:U, 2:N, 3:P, 4:E, 5:G -> not E in position 3.\n\n""baked"" B A K E D -> A absent.\n\n""joked"" J O K E D -> O in position 2?

Not.\n\nPerhaps ""newel"" N E W E L -> duplicate E, and position 1 is N, but we need position 2 to be N, so position 1 is not N.\n\nI think it\'s challenging.\n\nMaybe ""honey"" H O N E Y -> positions:1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:Y -> position 2 is O, not N.\n\nNot.\n\n""money"" M O N E Y -> position 2 is O, not N.\n\nNot.\n\nSo perhaps there are no common words with E in position 3 and N in position 2.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that E is in position 1.\n\nSo we can guess a word with E in position 1 and N in position 2.\n\nFor example, ""endow"".\n\n""endow"" is E N D O W.\n\nThis tests:\n- E in position 1: if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since E is in the word but not here, meaning E is in position 3).\n- N in position 2: we know it\'s correct, so we get ✓.\n- D in position 3: new letter.\n- O in position 4: if O is in position 4, we get ✓; if not, we get - (since O is present but not here).\n- W in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis will give us information about the position of E and O, and also test D and W.\n\nIf we are lucky, we might even guess the word.\n\nAnother option: ""envoy"" E N V O Y.\n\nBut V and Y are less common.\n\n""endow"" is better because D and W are more common than V and Y? D is common, W is less common, but V and Y are also less common.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""endow"".\n\nWe have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""ebony"" but position 2 is B, not N, so invalid.\n\n""eclat"" has C and A absent.\n\nSo ""endow"" seems a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""input"" but T is absent, and no E.\n\nMust include E.\n\nSo I think ""endow"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""endow"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (absent), A (absent), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position)\n- **Guess 2: ""onset""** → O (present, wrong position), N (correct position), S (absent), E (present, wrong position), T (absent)\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed letters and positions:**\n   - N is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (from ""onset"" feedback).\n   - E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n   - O is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\n2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T are not in the word and must be avoided.\n\n3. **Word structure:** The secret word has the form `[position1] N [position3] [position4] [position5]`, where:\n   - Position 1 or 3 must be E.\n   - One of positions 3, 4, or 5 must be O (but position 3 cannot hold both E and O, so if E is in position 3, O must be in 4 or 5).\n   - The remaining positions must be filled with new letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, A, S, T).\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- We need to test the position of E (position 1 vs. 3) and O (positions 3, 4, or 5) while gathering information on new common letters.\n- Since N is fixed at position 2, the guess must retain `[?] N [?] [?] [?]`.\n- We prioritize testing E in position 1 (to directly check if it is correct) and O in a new position (e.g., position 4) to resolve ambiguity.\n- We also test new high-frequency consonants like D, L, or H to maximize information.\n- After evaluating options (e.g., ""endow"", ""envoy"", ""unfed""), ""endow"" is chosen because:\n  - It tests E in position 1 (resolving if E is there or forcing it to position 3).\n  - It tests O in position 4 (helping locate O).\n  - It introduces new common letters D (position 3) and W (position 5), avoiding absent letters.\n  - It is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints.\n\n### Expected Feedback from ""endow"":\n- If E is in position 1, it will be marked correct (✓); if not, it will be marked present but wrong position (-) since E must be in position 3.\n- N in position 2 will be correct (✓).\n- O in position 4 will be correct (✓) if O is there, or present but wrong position (-) otherwise.\n- D and W will provide new information (✓, -, or x).\n\n<guess>endow</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\n  - C, R, A are absent.\n  - N is present but not in position 4.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)\n  - O is present but not in position 1.\n  - N is correct in position 2.\n  - S is absent.\n  - E is present but not in position 4.\n  - T is absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)\n  - E is correct in position 1.\n  - N is correct in position 2.\n  - D is absent.\n  - O is correct in position 4.\n  - W is absent.\n\nNow, from this feedback, we can deduce:\n\n1. **Correct letters in known positions:**\n   - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" feedback)\n   - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" and confirmed in ""endow"")\n   - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" feedback)\n\n2. **Absent letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W are not in the word.\n\n3. **Present letters from previous feedback:**\n   - We know E, N, O are in the word and now we know their positions: E in 1, N in 2, O in 4.\n\n4. **Word structure so far:**\n   - The secret word is: E N _ O _\n   - We need to fill positions 3 and 5.\n\n5. **Constraints for positions 3 and 5:**\n   - The letters must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, W.\n   - We have two letters to determine.\n\n6. **Additional information:**\n   - From guess 1, we know that N is not in position 4 (but we now know it\'s in position 2) and E is not in position 5 (but we now know it\'s in position 1). So no new constraints for positions 3 and 5 from that.\n   - From guess 2, we know O is not in position 1 (but now in 4) and E is not in position 4 (now in 1). Also, S and T are absent.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form E N ? O ? \n\nThe missing letters (position 3 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent letters.\n\nAbsent letters: A, C, D, R, S, T, W\n\nRemaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we should focus on common letters.\n\nWe have two positions to fill, and we need to guess a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nPossible common letters for position 3 and 5: L, I, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\nWe can list possible words that fit E N ? O ? \n\nFor example:\n- E N I O R → but R is absent.\n- E N O O ? → duplicate O? But we don\'t know if O is duplicated. However, in ""endow"", O was in position 4 and marked correct, so if there were two O\'s, we might have seen it? But in ""onset"", O was in position 1 and marked present but wrong position, but we now know O is in position 4. Since we haven\'t seen a second O marked, it\'s possible but less likely. We\'ll assume no duplicates for now.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""enrol"" → E N R O L → but R is absent and L in position 5? Also, R absent.\n- ""envoy"" → E N V O Y → V and Y. We haven\'t tried V or Y. But in guess 3, we tried ""endow"" and D and W were absent, so V and Y are possible.\n- ""ebony"" → E B O N Y → but position 2 is B? No, we have E B O N Y, so position 3 is O? But we need position 4 to be O, and in ""ebony"", position 4 is N, which is already in position 2. So not matching.\n- ""elbow"" → E L B O W → but W is absent (from guess 3).\n- ""endue"" → E N D U E → D absent and duplicate E? Not good.\n- ""ennui"" → E N N U I → duplicate N? And we know N is only one? Not necessarily, but in guess 1, N was present once, and in guess 2 and 3, only one N. But we can avoid duplicates.\n\nLet\'s list valid words:\n\n- ""enoki"" → a type of mushroom. E N O K I → but position 4 is O? In ""enoki"", positions: 1:E, 2:N, 3:O, 4:K, 5:I → but we need position 4 to be O, so this has O in position 3, not 4. So not matching.\n\nWe need position 4 to be O, so the word must be E N ? O ? \n\nSo position 3 is unknown, position 5 is unknown.\n\nExamples:\n- ""envoy"": E N V O Y → V in position 3, Y in position 5.\n- ""enjoy"": E N J O Y → J in position 3, Y in position 5.\n- ""enmity"": too long, 6 letters.\n- ""enter"": E N T E R → T and R absent, and duplicate E? Not valid.\n- ""euros"": E U R O S → R and S absent.\n- ""ethos"": E T H O S → T and S absent.\n- ""expos"": E X P O S → S absent.\n\nLess common:\n- ""enfix"": not common.\n- ""enzym"": E N Z Y M → Z, Y, M.\n\nBut let\'s consider common words.\n\nAnother one: ""enrol"" but R absent.\n\n""envoi"": E N V O I → similar to ""envoy"", but with I at the end. ""envoi"" is a word (a concluding stanza).\n\nSo E N V O I.\n\n""envoy"" is E N V O Y.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe also have ""ebony"", but it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\n""elbow"" has W absent.\n\n""endow"" we already tried, and D and W absent.\n\nAnother word: ""euros"" but R and S absent.\n\n""ethos"" T and S absent.\n\n""epoxy"" E P O X Y → but position 2 is P? E P O X Y → not E N ? O ? \n\nWe need N in position 2.\n\nSo back to ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" or ""enjoy"".\n\n""enjoy"" has J, which is less common.\n\n""envoy"" has V and Y.\n\n""envoi"" has V and I.\n\nI is more common than Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider ""ennui"" but duplicate N.\n\nAnother common word: ""enough"" → 6 letters.\n\n""ensue"" → E N S U E → S absent and duplicate E.\n\nNot.\n\nSo possible words: ""envoy"", ""envoi"", ""enzym"" (less common), ""enjoy"".\n\nWe should choose one that tests common letters.\n\nSince we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses common letters for position 3 and 5.\n\nCommon consonants: L, H, P, M, etc.\n\nBut in the pattern E N ? O ?, what words have common letters?\n\nFor example, ""enhol"" not a word.\n\n""enmew"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""eupad"" not a word.\n\nI think ""envoy"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with L or H.\n\n""enol"" is 4 letters.\n\n""enols"" has S absent.\n\n""enrol"" has R absent.\n\n""ethol"" not a word.\n\nSo ""envoy"" might be the best.\n\nBut we have another option: since we know E, N, O are fixed, we can try to solve for the remaining letters.\n\nWe have position 3 and 5 to fill.\n\nWe can guess a word that has common letters, say L and H, but we need a valid word.\n\nFor example, ""enol k"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""belch"" not matching.\n\nI think we have to choose from the available words.\n\nAnother word: ""euros"" not.\n\n""educe"" E D U C E → D and C absent.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think ""envoy"" is a good guess.\n\nBut in ""envoy"", we have V and Y. V is not extremely common, but it\'s possible.\n\n""envoi"" has V and I, which might be better because I is a vowel and more common.\n\n""envoi"" is a valid word, meaning a concluding part of a poem.\n\nSimilarly, ""envoy"" is a messenger.\n\nBoth are acceptable.\n\nI\'ll go with ""envoi"" because I is more common than Y.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we can get.\n\nIf we guess ""envoi"":\n- Position 1: E (should be ✓, since we know it\'s correct)\n- Position 2: N (✓)\n- Position 3: V (if V is in the word, we get feedback; if not, x)\n- Position 4: O (✓)\n- Position 5: I (if I is in the word, we get feedback)\n\nSimilarly for ""envoy"".\n\nBut we need to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.\n\nSince we have only two positions, and we know the word is E N ? O ?, we might even guess it.\n\nBut we don\'t know the letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""euros"" not.\n\n""piano"" not matching.\n\nI recall that ""genoa"" but G not in position 1.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""knoll"" not.\n\nI think ""envoy"" or ""envoi"" are fine.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""envoy"" as it is more common.\n\nTo be systematic, we can list all possible words.\n\nPossible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nFor position 5: same, but must form a valid word.\n\nCommon words:\n- envoy (V and Y)\n- envoi (V and I)\n- enjoy (J and Y) — J is less common\n- enzym (Z and M) — less common\n- enfix (F and X) — rare\n\nAlso, ""enmew"" not a word.\n\n""enbow"" but W absent.\n\nSo between ""envoy"" and ""envoi"", I\'ll pick ""envoy"" because it\'s more familiar.\n\nBut we have feedback that might help.\n\nWe know the word is E N _ O _\n\nWith the middle letter and last letter to be guessed.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, no other letters were present, and in the second, only O and E were present besides N, and in the third, only E, N, O were correct and D and W absent.\n\nSo the word has exactly three of the letters we\'ve tested? But we tested more.\n\nActually, we tested C,R,A,N,E in first; O,N,S,E,T in second; E,N,D,O,W in third.\n\nThe present letters are E, N, O, and no others from the tested ones.\n\nSo the remaining two letters are from the untested set.\n\nUntested letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to choose two of these for positions 3 and 5.\n\nCommon combinations: for example, L and D, but D is absent.\n\nD is absent.\n\nSo not.\n\nH and Y? But what word?\n\nE N H O Y? Not a word.\n\nU and L: E N U O L? Not a word.\n\nI and L: E N I O L? Not a word.\n\nV and Y: E N V O Y → envoy, which is a word.\n\nV and I: E N V O I → envoi.\n\nSo those are the only common words.\n\nTherefore, we can guess ""envoy"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with H.\n\nE N H O ? \n\n""enhol"" not.\n\n""enhop"" not.\n\nOr with G: ""engot"" not.\n\nSo I think ""envoy"" is the best choice.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""envoy"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** \n     - C, R, A are absent (x).\n     - N is present but not in position 4 (-).\n     - E is present but not in position 5 (-).\n   - **Guess 2 (""onset""):** \n     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).\n     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).\n     - S and T are absent (x).\n     - E is present but not in position 4 (-).\n   - **Guess 3 (""endow""):** \n     - E is correct in position 1 (✓).\n     - N is correct in position 2 (✓).\n     - D is absent (x).\n     - O is correct in position 4 (✓).\n     - W is absent (x).\n\n2. **Deductions:**\n   - **Confirmed Positions:**\n     - Position 1: E (from ""endow"" ✓).\n     - Position 2: N (from ""onset"" ✓ and ""endow"" ✓).\n     - Position 4: O (from ""endow"" ✓).\n   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W (all marked x in previous guesses).\n   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must be of the form `E N ? O ?`, where:\n     - The third and fifth positions need to be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n     - The letters must be from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since C, R, A, S, T, D, W are eliminated).\n   - **Constraints from Feedback:**\n     - E cannot be in position 5 (from ""crane"" -), but this is already satisfied as E is fixed at position 1.\n     - O cannot be in position 1 (from ""onset"" -), but this is satisfied as O is fixed at position 4.\n     - N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" -), but this is satisfied as N is fixed at position 2.\n   - **No Duplicates Likely:** Previous feedback showed no evidence of duplicate letters (e.g., only one N and E were ever marked), so we assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\n3. **Identify Possible Words:**\n   - The secret word is `E N ? O ?`. We need valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern, using letters not in the absent list.\n   - Common options:\n     - **""envoy""**: E N V O Y (V in position 3, Y in position 5).\n     - **""envoi""**: E N V O I (V in position 3, I in position 5).\n     - **""enjoy""**: E N J O Y (J in position 3, Y in position 5), but J is less common.\n     - Other possibilities like ""enzym"" (E N Z Y M) are rare and less ideal.\n   - ""envoy"" is chosen because:\n     - It uses common letters (V and Y are reasonably frequent).\n     - It tests high-value positions (3 and 5) with new letters.\n     - It is a familiar English word (meaning a messenger), increasing the likelihood of being valid.\n     - Alternatives like ""envoi"" (less common) or ""enjoy"" (J is infrequent) are weaker.\n\n4. **Strategy for This Guess:**\n   - **Goal:** Resolve the two unknown positions (3 and 5) by testing V and Y.\n   - **Expected Feedback:**\n     - E (position 1), N (position 2), and O (position 4) will be correct (✓) again.\n     - V (position 3) and Y (position 5) will provide new feedback: ✓ if correct, - if present but wrong position, or x if absent.\n     - If ""envoy"" is incorrect, feedback will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if V or Y is absent, we eliminate them and focus on other letters like I, L, or H for the next guess).\n\n5. **Final Decision:** ""envoy"" is the best guess to maximize information and progress toward the solution.\n\n<guess>envoy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(✓) S(x) E(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: endow -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓) W(x)\nGuess 4: envoy -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) V(x) O(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
- C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)
- O present but not pos1; N correct pos2; S and T absent; E present but not pos4.

Guess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)
- E correct pos1; N correct pos2; D absent; O correct pos4; W absent.

Guess 4: ""envoy"" → E(✓), N(✓), V(x), O(✓), Y(✓)
- E correct pos1; N correct pos2; V absent; O correct pos4; Y correct pos5.

Now, combining the feedback:

1. **Correct Positions (✓):**
   - Position 1: E
   - Position 2: N
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: Y (from guess 4)

2. **Absent Letters (x):** C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V

3. **Word Structure:** The secret word is E N ? O Y, with only position 3 missing.

4. **Constraints for Position 3:**
   - Must be a letter not in the absent list: C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V are out.
   - The letter must form a valid English word with ""E N ? O Y"".
   - Must avoid duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated).

We need to find a letter for position 3 that, when added, forms a valid 5-letter word. The word is ""E N _ O Y"".

Possible letters for position 3 (from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Z

Common English words matching ""E N _ O Y"":
- ""enjoy"": E N J O Y → but J is not yet tested? Let's check validity. However, in ""envoy"", Y is in position 5 and marked correct, so if we use ""enjoy"", it would have J in position 3 and Y in position 5. Since Y is already confirmed, we just need J.

Possible words:
- **""enjoy""**: E N J O Y → uses J (absent? not yet, but we haven't tested J). J is possible since no feedback on it.
- Others: 
  - ""enmoy""? Not a word.
  - ""enloy""? Not common.
  - ""ennoy""? No.
  - ""enpoy""? No.
  - ""empoi""? Not.
- Common known words: Only ""enjoy"" fits this pattern.

But is ""enjoy"" the only option? Let's confirm:
- ""soy"" is 3 letters, not.
- ""boy"" is 3 letters.
- We need 5 letters starting with E N and ending with O Y.

Yes, ""enjoy"" is a word meaning to take pleasure in.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""enjoy"".

Moreover, the feedback rules: position 3 must be filled with J (for ""enjoy"") or another letter if it exists, but ""enjoy"" is the primary candidate.

Since we have position 5 confirmed as Y from ""envoy"" feedback, and E,N,O positions fixed, the word must be ""enjoy"" unless there's another word. But no other common word exists for E N ? O Y.

Possible obscure words? For example:
- ""enok"" is 4 letters.
- ""enol"" is 4 letters.
- ""enrock""? Not 5 letters.

Therefore, ""enjoy"" is the only plausible word.

Hence, the secret word must be ""enjoy"".

In the feedback, for ""envoy"", we got Y(✓) in position 5, meaning the secret word has Y in position 5. And for earlier guesses, we know E in 1, N in 2, O in 4. So position 3 is the only unknown.

Therefore, we can confidently guess ""enjoy"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C, R, A absent (x). N present but not position 4 (-). E present but not position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""onset""):** O present but not position 1 (-). N correct in position 2 (✓). S, T absent (x). E present but not position 4 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""endow""):** E correct position 1 (✓). N correct position 2 (✓). D absent (x). O correct position 4 (✓). W absent (x).
   - **Guess 4 (""envoy""):** E correct position 1 (✓). N correct position 2 (✓). V absent (x). O correct position 4 (✓). Y correct position 5 (✓).

2. **Deductions:**
   - **Confirmed Positions:**
     - Position 1: E (fixed from ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 2: N (fixed from ""onset"" ✓).
     - Position 4: O (fixed from ""endow"" ✓).
     - Position 5: Y (fixed from ""envoy"" ✓).
   - **Absent Letters:** C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V (all marked x).
   - **Word Structure:** The secret word must be `E N ? O Y`, with only position 3 unknown.
   - **Constraints for Position 3:**
     - Must be a letter not in the absent list (so excluded: C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V).
     - Must form a valid English word with `E N ? O Y`.
     - Likely a common letter, with no duplicates (no prior feedback suggests duplicates).

3. **Identify Position 3 Letter:**
   - Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
   - Only **""enjoy""** (E N J O Y) fits the pattern as a valid 5-letter English word.
   - Other combinations like E N B O Y, E N F O Y, etc., do not form valid words based on common English vocabulary (e.g., ""enb oy"" or ""enf oy"" are nonsense).
   - Given that all other positions are confirmed, and ""enjoy"" uses the untested letter J (which hasn't been ruled out), this must be the solution.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The secret word is ""enjoy"". After filling position 3 with J, the word satisfies all feedback:
   - E (position 1), N (position 2), O (position 4), Y (position 5) are correct as previously confirmed.
   - J is tested for position 3 and will be marked ✓.

<guess>enjoy</guess>",enjoy,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)
- C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Guess 2: ""onset"" → O(-), N(✓), S(x), E(-), T(x)
- O present but not pos1; N correct pos2; S and T absent; E present but not pos4.

Guess 3: ""endow"" → E(✓), N(✓), D(x), O(✓), W(x)
- E correct pos1; N correct pos2; D absent; O correct pos4; W absent.

Guess 4: ""envoy"" → E(✓), N(✓), V(x), O(✓), Y(✓)
- E correct pos1; N correct pos2; V absent; O correct pos4; Y correct pos5.

Now, combining the feedback:

1. **Correct Positions (✓):**
   - Position 1: E
   - Position 2: N
   - Position 4: O
   - Position 5: Y (from guess 4)

2. **Absent Letters (x):** C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V

3. **Word Structure:** The secret word is E N ? O Y, with only position 3 missing.

4. **Constraints for Position 3:**
   - Must be a letter not in the absent list: C, R, A, S, T, D, W, V are out.
   - The letter must form a valid English word with ""E N ? O Y"".
   - Must avoid duplicate letters (since no duplicates have been indicated).
