We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We know that the word has N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

 Since N is in the word (but not in position 4), it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, E is in the word (but not in position 5), so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent E from being in position 4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 was taken by N and we know N is not in the correct position there, but that doesn't conflict with E being elsewhere.

 Also, we have eliminated three letters: C, R, A.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Contains N and E (since we know they are in the word) and three new letters.
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - We can try to put N and E in new positions to get more information.

 Additionally, we should consider common letters. Since we have two letters already (N and E), we can try to cover more frequent letters.

 Possible positions for N: we tried position 4 and it was wrong. So we can try putting N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was tried in position 5 and was wrong, so we can try positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have two '-' for N and E. That means they must appear in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So if we put N in the same position again, it would be a waste? Actually, we are required to make a valid word.

 Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that have N and E and don't use C, R, A.

 Some examples: 
   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don't know about S, P, I yet.
   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let's form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.

 However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.

 Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don't have much constraint.

 Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don't know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven't tried E at position 1 yet.

 But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.

 But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can't ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it's not required to reuse all known letters, but it's a good strategy because we can get more information about them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.

 How about ""LINEN""? It has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one '-', so that doesn't tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters.

 But ""LINEN"" has two N's and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.

 But let me check: ""LINEN"": 
   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

 But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn't been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.

 So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:
   N in position 3? That hasn't been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That's new.

 But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? 

 Other words: 
   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? 
   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.

 List: 
   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)
   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   We haven't tried E in position 2, and we haven't tried N in position 5? So that's okay.

   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.

   This word introduces B, G, I.

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). 
   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a '-', meaning it's not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it's wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it's wrong.

   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.

 Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we'll get '-' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we'll get either '-' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be '-' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.

   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 Therefore, possible words: 
   We can try: 
     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)
     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)

 So let's pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?
   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.

 How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don't have to, but then we wouldn't get information about E? And we know E is present? So it's better to include E? Because if we don't, then we don't know about the position of E? So we should.

 So let's consider: 
   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? 
   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). 
   But wait: what about E? We haven't tried position 4 for E? So that's good? 
   And N: we haven't tried position 3? So that's good? 
   Also, introduces M, I, D.

   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.

   Let's check: 
      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as 'x', so not present. So avoid C.

 How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position 
   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? 
   So that's okay? 
   But note: we haven't tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? 
   Also, introduces U, S, T.

   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.

 However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don't know? But common.

 But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? 

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? 
   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it's not there? 
   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? 

 We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.

 How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? 
   Positions: 
      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? 
      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? 
   So that works? 
   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.

   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.

   Similarly, E at 3? new.

   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it's a valid guess? 

   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? 
   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.

   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn't tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? 
   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? 

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.

   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as 'x'. So avoid A.

   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.

   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. 

   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.

   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? 

   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn't get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don't know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? 

   We should try to cover positions we haven't covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? 

   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   Considering: ""STEIN"" 
      Position1: S (new)
      Position2: T (new)
      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don't know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don't know? 
      Position4: I (new)
      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn't been tested? 

   So if we get feedback: 
        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's not? Then we get '-' if E is somewhere else? 
        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's in the word but not at 5? Then '-'? 

   Also, we learn about S, T, I? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": 
        Position1: B (new)
        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn't tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then '-'? )
        Position3: G (new)
        Position4: I (new)
        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else '-'? )

   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? 

   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? 

   But let me check: The first guess didn't reveal any letter? So the secret word's first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? 

   We don't have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It's good? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? 

   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven't used mandatory N? So we must include N? 

   So ""STEIN"" seems good? 

   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? 

   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? 

   So we must include N? 

   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? 

   So our guess: ""STEIN""

   Let me write the guess: STEIN

   Expected positions: 
        S at 1? 
        T at 2?
        E at 3?
        I at 4?
        N at 5?

   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven't done? And N in position 5? which we haven't done? 

   So it should be okay?

   We'll see the feedback and make the next guess accordingly.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess, we need a word that includes N and E (since they're confirmed present) and avoids C, R, A. We should also prioritize:
- Testing N in a new position (not 4)
- Testing E in a new position (not 5)
- Introducing new high-frequency letters like S, T, or I.
  
A strong candidate is **""stein""** (valid 5-letter word):  
- Places E in position 3 (new, untested position)  
- Places N in position 5 (new, untested position)  
- Introduces S, T, I (common letters not yet tested)  
- Avoids C, R, A.  

This guess efficiently probes new letters and placement for the known letters N and E.  

<guess>stein</guess>",stein,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We know that the word has N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

 Since N is in the word (but not in position 4), it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, E is in the word (but not in position 5), so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent E from being in position 4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 was taken by N and we know N is not in the correct position there, but that doesn't conflict with E being elsewhere.

 Also, we have eliminated three letters: C, R, A.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Contains N and E (since we know they are in the word) and three new letters.
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - We can try to put N and E in new positions to get more information.

 Additionally, we should consider common letters. Since we have two letters already (N and E), we can try to cover more frequent letters.

 Possible positions for N: we tried position 4 and it was wrong. So we can try putting N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was tried in position 5 and was wrong, so we can try positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have two '-' for N and E. That means they must appear in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So if we put N in the same position again, it would be a waste? Actually, we are required to make a valid word.

 Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that have N and E and don't use C, R, A.

 Some examples: 
   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don't know about S, P, I yet.
   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let's form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.

 However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.

 Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don't have much constraint.

 Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don't know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven't tried E at position 1 yet.

 But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.

 But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can't ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it's not required to reuse all known letters, but it's a good strategy because we can get more information about them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.

 How about ""LINEN""? It has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one '-', so that doesn't tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters.

 But ""LINEN"" has two N's and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.

 But let me check: ""LINEN"": 
   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

 But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn't been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.

 So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:
   N in position 3? That hasn't been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That's new.

 But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? 

 Other words: 
   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? 
   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.

 List: 
   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)
   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   We haven't tried E in position 2, and we haven't tried N in position 5? So that's okay.

   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.

   This word introduces B, G, I.

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). 
   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a '-', meaning it's not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it's wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it's wrong.

   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.

 Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we'll get '-' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we'll get either '-' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be '-' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.

   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 Therefore, possible words: 
   We can try: 
     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)
     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)

 So let's pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?
   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.

 How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don't have to, but then we wouldn't get information about E? And we know E is present? So it's better to include E? Because if we don't, then we don't know about the position of E? So we should.

 So let's consider: 
   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? 
   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). 
   But wait: what about E? We haven't tried position 4 for E? So that's good? 
   And N: we haven't tried position 3? So that's good? 
   Also, introduces M, I, D.

   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.

   Let's check: 
      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as 'x', so not present. So avoid C.

 How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position 
   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? 
   So that's okay? 
   But note: we haven't tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? 
   Also, introduces U, S, T.

   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.

 However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don't know? But common.

 But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? 

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? 
   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it's not there? 
   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? 

 We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.

 How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? 
   Positions: 
      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? 
      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? 
   So that works? 
   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.

   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.

   Similarly, E at 3? new.

   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it's a valid guess? 

   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? 
   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.

   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn't tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? 
   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? 

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.

   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as 'x'. So avoid A.

   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.

   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. 

   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.

   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? 

   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn't get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don't know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? 

   We should try to cover positions we haven't covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? 

   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   Considering: ""STEIN"" 
      Position1: S (new)
      Position2: T (new)
      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don't know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don't know? 
      Position4: I (new)
      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn't been tested? 

   So if we get feedback: 
        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's not? Then we get '-' if E is somewhere else? 
        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's in the word but not at 5? Then '-'? 

   Also, we learn about S, T, I? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": 
        Position1: B (new)
        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn't tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then '-'? )
        Position3: G (new)
        Position4: I (new)
        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else '-'? )

   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? 

   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? 

   But let me check: The first guess didn't reveal any letter? So the secret word's first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? 

   We don't have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It's good? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? 

   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven't used mandatory N? So we must include N? 

   So ""STEIN"" seems good? 

   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? 

   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? 

   So we must include N? 

   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? 

   So our guess: ""STEIN""

   Let me write the guess: STEIN

   Expected positions: 
        S at 1? 
        T at 2?
        E at 3?
        I at 4?
        N at 5?

   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven't done? And N in position 5? which we haven't done? 

   So it should be okay?

   We'll see the feedback and make the next guess accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess, we need a word that includes N and E (since they're confirmed present) and avoids C, R, A. We should also prioritize:
- Testing N in a new position (not 4)
- Testing E in a new position (not 5)
- Introducing new high-frequency letters like S, T, or I.
  
A strong candidate is **""stein""** (valid 5-letter word):  
- Places E in position 3 (new, untested position)  
- Places N in position 5 (new, untested position)  
- Introduces S, T, I (common letters not yet tested)  
- Avoids C, R, A.  

This guess efficiently probes new letters and placement for the known letters N and E.",Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,inlet,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We know that the word has N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

 Since N is in the word (but not in position 4), it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, E is in the word (but not in position 5), so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent E from being in position 4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 was taken by N and we know N is not in the correct position there, but that doesn't conflict with E being elsewhere.

 Also, we have eliminated three letters: C, R, A.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Contains N and E (since we know they are in the word) and three new letters.
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - We can try to put N and E in new positions to get more information.

 Additionally, we should consider common letters. Since we have two letters already (N and E), we can try to cover more frequent letters.

 Possible positions for N: we tried position 4 and it was wrong. So we can try putting N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was tried in position 5 and was wrong, so we can try positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have two '-' for N and E. That means they must appear in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So if we put N in the same position again, it would be a waste? Actually, we are required to make a valid word.

 Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that have N and E and don't use C, R, A.

 Some examples: 
   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don't know about S, P, I yet.
   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let's form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.

 However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.

 Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don't have much constraint.

 Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don't know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven't tried E at position 1 yet.

 But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.

 But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can't ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it's not required to reuse all known letters, but it's a good strategy because we can get more information about them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.

 How about ""LINEN""? It has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one '-', so that doesn't tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters.

 But ""LINEN"" has two N's and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.

 But let me check: ""LINEN"": 
   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

 But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn't been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.

 So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:
   N in position 3? That hasn't been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That's new.

 But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? 

 Other words: 
   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? 
   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.

 List: 
   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)
   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   We haven't tried E in position 2, and we haven't tried N in position 5? So that's okay.

   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.

   This word introduces B, G, I.

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). 
   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a '-', meaning it's not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it's wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it's wrong.

   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.

 Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we'll get '-' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we'll get either '-' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be '-' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.

   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 Therefore, possible words: 
   We can try: 
     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)
     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)

 So let's pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?
   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.

 How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don't have to, but then we wouldn't get information about E? And we know E is present? So it's better to include E? Because if we don't, then we don't know about the position of E? So we should.

 So let's consider: 
   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? 
   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). 
   But wait: what about E? We haven't tried position 4 for E? So that's good? 
   And N: we haven't tried position 3? So that's good? 
   Also, introduces M, I, D.

   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.

   Let's check: 
      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as 'x', so not present. So avoid C.

 How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position 
   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? 
   So that's okay? 
   But note: we haven't tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? 
   Also, introduces U, S, T.

   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.

 However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don't know? But common.

 But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? 

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? 
   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it's not there? 
   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? 

 We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.

 How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? 
   Positions: 
      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? 
      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? 
   So that works? 
   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.

   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.

   Similarly, E at 3? new.

   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it's a valid guess? 

   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? 
   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.

   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn't tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? 
   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? 

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.

   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as 'x'. So avoid A.

   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.

   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. 

   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.

   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? 

   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn't get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don't know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? 

   We should try to cover positions we haven't covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? 

   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   Considering: ""STEIN"" 
      Position1: S (new)
      Position2: T (new)
      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don't know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don't know? 
      Position4: I (new)
      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn't been tested? 

   So if we get feedback: 
        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's not? Then we get '-' if E is somewhere else? 
        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's in the word but not at 5? Then '-'? 

   Also, we learn about S, T, I? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": 
        Position1: B (new)
        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn't tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then '-'? )
        Position3: G (new)
        Position4: I (new)
        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else '-'? )

   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? 

   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? 

   But let me check: The first guess didn't reveal any letter? So the secret word's first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? 

   We don't have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It's good? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? 

   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven't used mandatory N? So we must include N? 

   So ""STEIN"" seems good? 

   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? 

   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? 

   So we must include N? 

   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? 

   So our guess: ""STEIN""

   Let me write the guess: STEIN

   Expected positions: 
        S at 1? 
        T at 2?
        E at 3?
        I at 4?
        N at 5?

   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven't done? And N in position 5? which we haven't done? 

   So it should be okay?

   We'll see the feedback and make the next guess accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess, we need a word that includes N and E (since they're confirmed present) and avoids C, R, A. We should also prioritize:
- Testing N in a new position (not 4)
- Testing E in a new position (not 5)
- Introducing new high-frequency letters like S, T, or I.
  
A strong candidate is **""stein""** (valid 5-letter word):  
- Places E in position 3 (new, untested position)  
- Places N in position 5 (new, untested position)  
- Introduces S, T, I (common letters not yet tested)  
- Avoids C, R, A.  

This guess efficiently probes new letters and placement for the known letters N and E.

So we must avoid these letters.\n\n Now, we have to make a second guess. We know that the word has N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.\n\n Since N is in the word (but not in position 4), it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, E is in the word (but not in position 5), so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n However, note that the feedback doesn\'t prevent E from being in position 4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and we got a \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 was taken by N and we know N is not in the correct position there, but that doesn\'t conflict with E being elsewhere.\n\n Also, we have eliminated three letters: C, R, A.\n\n We should choose a word that:\n   - Contains N and E (since we know they are in the word) and three new letters.\n   - Does not contain C, R, A.\n   - We can try to put N and E in new positions to get more information.\n\n Additionally, we should consider common letters. Since we have two letters already (N and E), we can try to cover more frequent letters.\n\n Possible positions for N: we tried position 4 and it was wrong. So we can try putting N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n Similarly, E was tried in position 5 and was wrong, so we can try positions 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n However, note: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have two \'-\' for N and E. That means they must appear in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So if we put N in the same position again, it would be a waste? Actually, we are required to make a valid word.\n\n Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.\n\n Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have N and E and don\'t use C, R, A.\n\n Some examples: \n   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don\'t know about S, P, I yet.\n   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let\'s form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.\n\n However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don\'t have much constraint.\n\n Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don\'t know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven\'t tried E at position 1 yet.\n\n But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.\n\n But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can\'t ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it\'s not required to reuse all known letters, but it\'s a good strategy because we can get more information about them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.\n\n How about ""LINEN""? It has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one \'-\', so that doesn\'t tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\n But ""LINEN"" has two N\'s and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.\n\n But let me check: ""LINEN"": \n   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.\n\n But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn\'t been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.\n\n So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:\n   N in position 3? That hasn\'t been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That\'s new.\n\n But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? \n\n Other words: \n   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? \n   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.\n\n We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.\n\n List: \n   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)\n   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? \n   We haven\'t tried E in position 2, and we haven\'t tried N in position 5? So that\'s okay.\n\n   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.\n\n   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.\n\n   This word introduces B, G, I.\n\n Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). \n   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it\'s wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it\'s wrong.\n\n   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it\'s in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we\'ll get \'-\' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we\'ll get either \'-\' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be \'-\' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.\n\n   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.\n\n Therefore, possible words: \n   We can try: \n     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)\n     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)\n\n So let\'s pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.\n\n ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?\n   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.\n\n How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don\'t have to, but then we wouldn\'t get information about E? And we know E is present? So it\'s better to include E? Because if we don\'t, then we don\'t know about the position of E? So we should.\n\n So let\'s consider: \n   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? \n   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). \n   But wait: what about E? We haven\'t tried position 4 for E? So that\'s good? \n   And N: we haven\'t tried position 3? So that\'s good? \n   Also, introduces M, I, D.\n\n   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n   Let\'s check: \n      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as \'x\', so not present. So avoid C.\n\n How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> \n   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position \n   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? \n   So that\'s okay? \n   But note: we haven\'t tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? \n   Also, introduces U, S, T.\n\n   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.\n\n However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don\'t know? But common.\n\n But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? \n\n Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? \n   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it\'s not there? \n   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? \n\n We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.\n\n How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? \n   Positions: \n      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? \n      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? \n   So that works? \n   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.\n\n   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.\n\n   Similarly, E at 3? new.\n\n   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it\'s a valid guess? \n\n   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? \n   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.\n\n   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn\'t tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? \n   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? \n\n   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.\n\n   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as \'x\'. So avoid A.\n\n   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.\n\n   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. \n\n   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.\n\n   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? \n\n   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn\'t get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don\'t know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? \n\n   We should try to cover positions we haven\'t covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? \n\n   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? \n\n   Considering: ""STEIN"" \n      Position1: S (new)\n      Position2: T (new)\n      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don\'t know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don\'t know? \n      Position4: I (new)\n      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn\'t been tested? \n\n   So if we get feedback: \n        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s not? Then we get \'-\' if E is somewhere else? \n        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but not at 5? Then \'-\'? \n\n   Also, we learn about S, T, I? \n\n   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": \n        Position1: B (new)\n        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn\'t tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then \'-\'? )\n        Position3: G (new)\n        Position4: I (new)\n        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else \'-\'? )\n\n   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? \n\n   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? \n\n   But let me check: The first guess didn\'t reveal any letter? So the secret word\'s first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? \n\n   We don\'t have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It\'s good? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".\n\n   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? \n\n   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? \n\n   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven\'t used mandatory N? So we must include N? \n\n   So ""STEIN"" seems good? \n\n   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? \n\n   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? \n\n   So we must include N? \n\n   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".\n\n   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? \n\n   So our guess: ""STEIN""\n\n   Let me write the guess: STEIN\n\n   Expected positions: \n        S at 1? \n        T at 2?\n        E at 3?\n        I at 4?\n        N at 5?\n\n   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven\'t done?

We are given feedback from the second guess ""stein"":
  S: x -> not in the word
  T: - -> in the word but wrong position
  E: - -> in the word but wrong position (but note: we already knew E was in the word from the first guess)
  I: - -> in the word but wrong position
  N: - -> in the word but wrong position (but we already knew N was in the word)

So, to summarize:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T, E, I, N are in the word, but none of them are in the positions we guessed in ""stein"":
    T is not in position 2
    E is not in position 3
    I is not in position 4
    N is not in position 5

Additionally, from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is not in position 4 (already known, and now also not in position 5 from this guess).
- E is not in position 5 (already known, and now also not in position 3 from this guess).

So, the letters we know are in the word: T, E, I, N (and we already had E and N from before, now we add T and I).

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, S.

We have two guesses so far, and we have 6 tries total, so we are on the third guess.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains T, E, I, N (since all are in the word) and one new letter (because we have 4 known letters and one unknown).
- Avoids C, R, A, S.
- Does not place T in position 2, E in position 3, I in position 4, N in position 5 (because we know they are wrong for these positions).
- Also, from the first guess, we know N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Moreover, we have to consider the positions that are still possible for each letter.

Let's list the possible positions for each known letter:

For T:
  We know T is not in position 2 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried T in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? 
  But note: in the first guess, we had no T? So we only have the constraint from the second guess: not position 2.

For E:
  We know E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""stein"").
  So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.
  Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For I:
  We know I is not in position 4 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried I in other positions? So I can be in 1, 2, 3, 5.

For N:
  We know N is not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""stein"").
  So N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Now, we have to include all four: T, E, I, N, and one new letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter that we haven't tried? But we have to avoid C, R, A, S.

We also note that the word must have exactly these five letters? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? But we can't be sure? However, to maximize information, we try to use distinct letters? But we have to use T, E, I, N? and one more? So we need a word that has these four and one new letter? 

But wait: we have four known letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed? And we have to avoid C, R, A, S? 

We have guessed: 
  First guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know C,R,A are absent, and N,E are present.
  Second guess: S, T, E, I, N -> we know S is absent, and T, I are present (and we already knew E and N).

So the absent letters: C, R, A, S.

The present letters: T, E, I, N.

So the secret word must contain T, E, I, N and one more letter that is not C, R, A, S and not any of the present ones? Actually, the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't guessed? Or it could be one of the present ones? But we have four distinct letters? So the fifth is a new letter? 

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, two T's? But we don't have any indication? So we assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, we need a word that has T, E, I, N and one new letter (say X) that is not in {C, R, A, S} and not in {T, E, I, N}? So X is a letter we haven't tried? 

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So the new letter must be from the remaining letters? 

The alphabet: A to Z, minus the ones we've tried? 
  Tried: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T -> so missing: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose any of these? But we want a common letter? 

Now, we have to form a word with T, E, I, N and one new letter? And we have to assign them to positions 1 to 5? 

But we have constraints on the positions for E and N? 
  E: must be in 1, 2, or 4.
  N: must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, T: cannot be in 2? But can be in 1,3,4,5? 
I: cannot be in 4? But can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have to avoid placing any of these letters in the positions we know they are wrong? 

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies these constraints? 

Let me try to think of words that have T, E, I, N and one more letter? 

For example, ""TEN"" is three letters? We need five? 

Possible words: 
  ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> 
      Letters: I, N, L, E, T -> that's the four known and L? 
      But we have to check positions? 
      We can assign: 
        I: can be in 1? 
        N: can be in 2? 
        L: new letter? 
        E: can be in 4? 
        T: can be in 5? 

      But we have to form the word ""INLET"": 
        I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

      Now, check constraints:
        T: in position 5? Is that allowed? We know T cannot be in position 2? 5 is okay? 
        E: in position 4? We know E can be in 4? (since E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in position 1? We know I cannot be in 4? 1 is okay? 
        N: in position 2? We know N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is okay? 

      Also, we are introducing L? which is new? 

      So ""INLET"" seems a candidate? 

  But note: we have to avoid S? and we do? 

  Another candidate: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
      Letters: U, N, I, T, E -> that's the four and U? 
      Word: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5)? 
      But wait: E is in position 5? We know E cannot be in position 5? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      Alternatively, we can form ""UNITE"" as U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at 5 is forbidden? 

      How about ""UNTIE"": U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? forbidden? 

      So we cannot have E at 5? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": but missing E? 

  Another: ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)? 
      But E is in position 3? We know E cannot be in position 3? (from ""stein"" feedback: E at 3 was marked as wrong position? meaning E is not at 3? So we cannot put E at 3 again? 

      So ""INEPT"" with E at 3 is invalid? 

      But if we rearrange? The word must be a valid English word? 

  How about ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> missing E? 

  We must have E? 

  Another: ""TOWIE""? not a word? 

  ""TINE"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENOR"": has R? R is not allowed? 

  ""TIGER"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""TIDES"": has S? not allowed? 

  ""TILED"": T, I, L, E, D -> 
      Letters: T, I, L, E, D -> that's T, I, E and L and D? But we are missing N? We must have N? 

  So we must include N? 

  Back to ""INLET"": it has I, N, L, E, T -> that's all four? 

  Another: ""ELINT"" (a word? meaning electronic intelligence) -> E, L, I, N, T -> 
      We can assign: 
        E in 1? -> allowed? (E can be in 1,2,4) -> 1 is allowed? 
        L in 2? 
        I in 3? 
        N in 4? -> but wait: N cannot be in position 4? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      If we try to rearrange? But the word is fixed? 

  ""ELINT"" is E(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N in 4? not allowed? 

  How about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> 
      L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
      Check constraints:
        N: in 3? allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 3 is allowed)
        E: in 4? allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in 2? allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 2 is allowed)
        T: missing? we must have T? 

  But ""LINED"" does not have T? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need a word with T, E, I, N and one more? 

  How about ""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> missing N? 

  ""TINED""? not a word? 

  ""TINY"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENCH""? has C? not allowed? 

  ""BENT"" is 4? 

  ""INLET"" seems the best so far? 

  But let me check: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

  Constraints:
    I: position 1 -> allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 1 is allowed) 
    N: position 2 -> allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
    L: new letter? 
    E: position 4 -> allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
    T: position 5 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 5 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 5? 

  Also, we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So ""INLET"" is a valid guess? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 5? and we know T is in the word? but we haven't tried T in 5? so that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> missing T and E? 

  ""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> 
      T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
        N in 4? not allowed? 
        E in 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""TWICE"": has C? not allowed? 

  ""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> missing N? 

  ""TRITE"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""WHITE"": missing N? 

  ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> has R? not allowed? 

  ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5) -> 
        E in 3? not allowed? (from ""stein"", E at 3 was wrong) 
        N in 2? allowed? 
        T in 5? allowed? 
        But E in 3 is forbidden? 

  How about ""NITER"": has R? 

  ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> missing N? 

  ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> 
      M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
        This has T? no? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need T? 

  After some thought, ""INLET"" seems a good candidate? 

  But let me see if there is a word that uses a more common letter? 

  ""TITLE"": T, I, T, L, E -> duplicate T? and missing N? 

  ""LENT"" is 4? 

  ""INTEL"": I, N, T, E, L -> 
      I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> 
        Check constraints:
          I: 1 -> allowed
          N: 2 -> allowed (1,2,3)
          T: 3 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 3 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 3? 
          E: 4 -> allowed? (1,2,4) -> 4 is allowed? 
          L: new? 
        Also, avoids C,R,A,S? 

      So ""INTEL"" is a valid word? 

      But note: we have T in position 3? and we haven't tried T in 3? 

      Also, we have I in 1? and we haven't tried I in 1? 

      This is similar to ""INLET""? 

      Actually, ""INTEL"" has the same letters? I,N,T,E,L? 

      But arranged as I,N,T,E,L? 

      So both ""INLET"" and ""INTEL"" are anagrams? 

      But ""INTEL"" is a proper noun? But Wordle accepts it? 

      We can use either? 

      Let me choose ""INTEL"" because it has T in the middle? 

      But note: in ""INTEL"", we are putting T in position 3? and we know T is not in position 2? but 3 is new? 

      Also, E in 4? which is allowed? 

      So both are acceptable? 

      I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's a common word? 

  But wait: we have to consider the feedback we might get? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we cannot because of E at 5? 

  Another word: ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> 
      U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> 
        E at 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": no E? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good choice? 

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong? 

  In ""INTEL"": 
      I at 1: we haven't tried I at 1? 
      N at 2: we haven't tried N at 2? 
      T at 3: we haven't tried T at 3? 
      E at 4: we haven't tried E at 4? 
      L at 5: new? 

  And we know E can be at 4? and N can be at 2? 

  So it's valid? 

  Therefore, we guess ""INTEL"". 

  But let me double-check: 
      We know T is in the word? and we are putting it at 3? 
      We know E is in the word? and we put at 4? 
      We know I is in the word? and we put at 1? 
      We know N is in the word? and we put at 2? 

  And L is new? 

  And we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So yes? 

  But note: the word ""INTEL"" is 5 letters? 

  So we'll go with that? 

  However, what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we have to try? 

  Alternatively, we might consider ""TENOR"" but R is not allowed? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good guess? 

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a position we haven't tried? 

  We are trying I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5? 

  We might get some correct? 

  So let's make the guess: ""INTEL""

  But note: we have to output in the format: <guess>intel</guess>? 

  However, let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel? But we have I and E? 

  Another candidate: ""OFTEN"": O, F, T, E, N -> 
      O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        But N at 5? not allowed? (from ""stein"", N at 5 was wrong) -> so invalid? 

  ""OFTEN"" has N at 5? which we know is wrong? 

  So no? 

  Therefore, I choose ""INTEL"". 

  But wait: what about ""INLET""? It's also valid? 

  Actually, ""INLET"" has the same set of letters? and we can form: 
      I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
        T at 5? which is allowed? 

  But in ""INTEL"", we have T at 3? 

  Which one is better? 

  We know that T cannot be at 2? but we haven't tried T at 3 or 5? 

  Similarly, we haven't tried E at 4? 

  So both are equally good? 

  But note: in ""INTEL"", we are trying T at 3? and in ""INLET"", we are trying T at 5? 

  We don't have any information about T at 3 or 5? 

  So we can choose either? 

  I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's more common? 

  But let me check: ""INTEL"" is a brand? but it's accepted? 

  Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose ""INLET""? 

  But I think both are acceptable? 

  I'll choose ""INTEL"". 

  So the guess is ""INTEL"". 

  But note: the feedback from the second guess: 
      S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)

  So we know T, E, I, N are present? 

  And we are using them? 

  So we are good? 

  Let's output: <guess>intel</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)`  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N and E** are **present** but in the wrong positions (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → Feedback: `S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)`  
  - **S** is **absent**.  
  - **T, E, I, N** are **present** but in the wrong positions:  
    - T not in position 2  
    - E not in position 3  
    - I not in position 4  
    - N not in position 5  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: T, E, I, N (all must appear).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S.  
- **Positional constraints**:  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.  
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2.  
  - I cannot be in position 4.  
- The word must include **one new letter** (not C, R, A, S, T, E, I, N).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word containing **T, E, I, N** + **one new letter** (e.g., L, D, M, P, O, etc.).  
- Avoid forbidden positions for known letters.  
- Prioritize common letters and test new positions:  
  - E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
  - T can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
  - I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  

### Chosen Guess: **INTEL**
- **I** in position 1 (allowed, not position 4).  
- **N** in position 2 (allowed, not position 4 or 5).  
- **T** in position 3 (allowed, not position 2).  
- **E** in position 4 (allowed, not position 3 or 5).  
- **L** (new letter) in position 5.  
- **Why this works**:  
  - Tests all known letters (T, E, I, N) in new, valid positions.  
  - Introduces **L** (high-frequency consonant) to probe for the last unknown letter.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, S) and adheres to positional constraints.  

<guess>intel</guess>",intel,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""stein"":
  S: x -> not in the word
  T: - -> in the word but wrong position
  E: - -> in the word but wrong position (but note: we already knew E was in the word from the first guess)
  I: - -> in the word but wrong position
  N: - -> in the word but wrong position (but we already knew N was in the word)

So, to summarize:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T, E, I, N are in the word, but none of them are in the positions we guessed in ""stein"":
    T is not in position 2
    E is not in position 3
    I is not in position 4
    N is not in position 5

Additionally, from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is not in position 4 (already known, and now also not in position 5 from this guess).
- E is not in position 5 (already known, and now also not in position 3 from this guess).

So, the letters we know are in the word: T, E, I, N (and we already had E and N from before, now we add T and I).

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, S.

We have two guesses so far, and we have 6 tries total, so we are on the third guess.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains T, E, I, N (since all are in the word) and one new letter (because we have 4 known letters and one unknown).
- Avoids C, R, A, S.
- Does not place T in position 2, E in position 3, I in position 4, N in position 5 (because we know they are wrong for these positions).
- Also, from the first guess, we know N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Moreover, we have to consider the positions that are still possible for each letter.

Let's list the possible positions for each known letter:

For T:
  We know T is not in position 2 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried T in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? 
  But note: in the first guess, we had no T? So we only have the constraint from the second guess: not position 2.

For E:
  We know E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""stein"").
  So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.
  Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For I:
  We know I is not in position 4 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried I in other positions? So I can be in 1, 2, 3, 5.

For N:
  We know N is not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""stein"").
  So N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Now, we have to include all four: T, E, I, N, and one new letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter that we haven't tried? But we have to avoid C, R, A, S.

We also note that the word must have exactly these five letters? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? But we can't be sure? However, to maximize information, we try to use distinct letters? But we have to use T, E, I, N? and one more? So we need a word that has these four and one new letter? 

But wait: we have four known letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed? And we have to avoid C, R, A, S? 

We have guessed: 
  First guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know C,R,A are absent, and N,E are present.
  Second guess: S, T, E, I, N -> we know S is absent, and T, I are present (and we already knew E and N).

So the absent letters: C, R, A, S.

The present letters: T, E, I, N.

So the secret word must contain T, E, I, N and one more letter that is not C, R, A, S and not any of the present ones? Actually, the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't guessed? Or it could be one of the present ones? But we have four distinct letters? So the fifth is a new letter? 

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, two T's? But we don't have any indication? So we assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, we need a word that has T, E, I, N and one new letter (say X) that is not in {C, R, A, S} and not in {T, E, I, N}? So X is a letter we haven't tried? 

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So the new letter must be from the remaining letters? 

The alphabet: A to Z, minus the ones we've tried? 
  Tried: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T -> so missing: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose any of these? But we want a common letter? 

Now, we have to form a word with T, E, I, N and one new letter? And we have to assign them to positions 1 to 5? 

But we have constraints on the positions for E and N? 
  E: must be in 1, 2, or 4.
  N: must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, T: cannot be in 2? But can be in 1,3,4,5? 
I: cannot be in 4? But can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have to avoid placing any of these letters in the positions we know they are wrong? 

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies these constraints? 

Let me try to think of words that have T, E, I, N and one more letter? 

For example, ""TEN"" is three letters? We need five? 

Possible words: 
  ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> 
      Letters: I, N, L, E, T -> that's the four known and L? 
      But we have to check positions? 
      We can assign: 
        I: can be in 1? 
        N: can be in 2? 
        L: new letter? 
        E: can be in 4? 
        T: can be in 5? 

      But we have to form the word ""INLET"": 
        I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

      Now, check constraints:
        T: in position 5? Is that allowed? We know T cannot be in position 2? 5 is okay? 
        E: in position 4? We know E can be in 4? (since E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in position 1? We know I cannot be in 4? 1 is okay? 
        N: in position 2? We know N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is okay? 

      Also, we are introducing L? which is new? 

      So ""INLET"" seems a candidate? 

  But note: we have to avoid S? and we do? 

  Another candidate: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
      Letters: U, N, I, T, E -> that's the four and U? 
      Word: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5)? 
      But wait: E is in position 5? We know E cannot be in position 5? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      Alternatively, we can form ""UNITE"" as U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at 5 is forbidden? 

      How about ""UNTIE"": U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? forbidden? 

      So we cannot have E at 5? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": but missing E? 

  Another: ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)? 
      But E is in position 3? We know E cannot be in position 3? (from ""stein"" feedback: E at 3 was marked as wrong position? meaning E is not at 3? So we cannot put E at 3 again? 

      So ""INEPT"" with E at 3 is invalid? 

      But if we rearrange? The word must be a valid English word? 

  How about ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> missing E? 

  We must have E? 

  Another: ""TOWIE""? not a word? 

  ""TINE"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENOR"": has R? R is not allowed? 

  ""TIGER"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""TIDES"": has S? not allowed? 

  ""TILED"": T, I, L, E, D -> 
      Letters: T, I, L, E, D -> that's T, I, E and L and D? But we are missing N? We must have N? 

  So we must include N? 

  Back to ""INLET"": it has I, N, L, E, T -> that's all four? 

  Another: ""ELINT"" (a word? meaning electronic intelligence) -> E, L, I, N, T -> 
      We can assign: 
        E in 1? -> allowed? (E can be in 1,2,4) -> 1 is allowed? 
        L in 2? 
        I in 3? 
        N in 4? -> but wait: N cannot be in position 4? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      If we try to rearrange? But the word is fixed? 

  ""ELINT"" is E(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N in 4? not allowed? 

  How about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> 
      L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
      Check constraints:
        N: in 3? allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 3 is allowed)
        E: in 4? allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in 2? allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 2 is allowed)
        T: missing? we must have T? 

  But ""LINED"" does not have T? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need a word with T, E, I, N and one more? 

  How about ""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> missing N? 

  ""TINED""? not a word? 

  ""TINY"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENCH""? has C? not allowed? 

  ""BENT"" is 4? 

  ""INLET"" seems the best so far? 

  But let me check: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

  Constraints:
    I: position 1 -> allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 1 is allowed) 
    N: position 2 -> allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
    L: new letter? 
    E: position 4 -> allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
    T: position 5 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 5 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 5? 

  Also, we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So ""INLET"" is a valid guess? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 5? and we know T is in the word? but we haven't tried T in 5? so that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> missing T and E? 

  ""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> 
      T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
        N in 4? not allowed? 
        E in 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""TWICE"": has C? not allowed? 

  ""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> missing N? 

  ""TRITE"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""WHITE"": missing N? 

  ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> has R? not allowed? 

  ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5) -> 
        E in 3? not allowed? (from ""stein"", E at 3 was wrong) 
        N in 2? allowed? 
        T in 5? allowed? 
        But E in 3 is forbidden? 

  How about ""NITER"": has R? 

  ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> missing N? 

  ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> 
      M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
        This has T? no? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need T? 

  After some thought, ""INLET"" seems a good candidate? 

  But let me see if there is a word that uses a more common letter? 

  ""TITLE"": T, I, T, L, E -> duplicate T? and missing N? 

  ""LENT"" is 4? 

  ""INTEL"": I, N, T, E, L -> 
      I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> 
        Check constraints:
          I: 1 -> allowed
          N: 2 -> allowed (1,2,3)
          T: 3 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 3 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 3? 
          E: 4 -> allowed? (1,2,4) -> 4 is allowed? 
          L: new? 
        Also, avoids C,R,A,S? 

      So ""INTEL"" is a valid word? 

      But note: we have T in position 3? and we haven't tried T in 3? 

      Also, we have I in 1? and we haven't tried I in 1? 

      This is similar to ""INLET""? 

      Actually, ""INTEL"" has the same letters? I,N,T,E,L? 

      But arranged as I,N,T,E,L? 

      So both ""INLET"" and ""INTEL"" are anagrams? 

      But ""INTEL"" is a proper noun? But Wordle accepts it? 

      We can use either? 

      Let me choose ""INTEL"" because it has T in the middle? 

      But note: in ""INTEL"", we are putting T in position 3? and we know T is not in position 2? but 3 is new? 

      Also, E in 4? which is allowed? 

      So both are acceptable? 

      I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's a common word? 

  But wait: we have to consider the feedback we might get? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we cannot because of E at 5? 

  Another word: ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> 
      U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> 
        E at 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": no E? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good choice? 

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong? 

  In ""INTEL"": 
      I at 1: we haven't tried I at 1? 
      N at 2: we haven't tried N at 2? 
      T at 3: we haven't tried T at 3? 
      E at 4: we haven't tried E at 4? 
      L at 5: new? 

  And we know E can be at 4? and N can be at 2? 

  So it's valid? 

  Therefore, we guess ""INTEL"". 

  But let me double-check: 
      We know T is in the word? and we are putting it at 3? 
      We know E is in the word? and we put at 4? 
      We know I is in the word? and we put at 1? 
      We know N is in the word? and we put at 2? 

  And L is new? 

  And we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So yes? 

  But note: the word ""INTEL"" is 5 letters? 

  So we'll go with that? 

  However, what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we have to try? 

  Alternatively, we might consider ""TENOR"" but R is not allowed? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good guess? 

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a position we haven't tried? 

  We are trying I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5? 

  We might get some correct? 

  So let's make the guess: ""INTEL""

  But note: we have to output in the format: <guess>intel</guess>? 

  However, let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel? But we have I and E? 

  Another candidate: ""OFTEN"": O, F, T, E, N -> 
      O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        But N at 5? not allowed? (from ""stein"", N at 5 was wrong) -> so invalid? 

  ""OFTEN"" has N at 5? which we know is wrong? 

  So no? 

  Therefore, I choose ""INTEL"". 

  But wait: what about ""INLET""? It's also valid? 

  Actually, ""INLET"" has the same set of letters? and we can form: 
      I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
        T at 5? which is allowed? 

  But in ""INTEL"", we have T at 3? 

  Which one is better? 

  We know that T cannot be at 2? but we haven't tried T at 3 or 5? 

  Similarly, we haven't tried E at 4? 

  So both are equally good? 

  But note: in ""INTEL"", we are trying T at 3? and in ""INLET"", we are trying T at 5? 

  We don't have any information about T at 3 or 5? 

  So we can choose either? 

  I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's more common? 

  But let me check: ""INTEL"" is a brand? but it's accepted? 

  Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose ""INLET""? 

  But I think both are acceptable? 

  I'll choose ""INTEL"". 

  So the guess is ""INTEL"". 

  But note: the feedback from the second guess: 
      S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)

  So we know T, E, I, N are present? 

  And we are using them? 

  So we are good? 

  Let's output: <guess>intel</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)`  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N and E** are **present** but in the wrong positions (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → Feedback: `S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)`  
  - **S** is **absent**.  
  - **T, E, I, N** are **present** but in the wrong positions:  
    - T not in position 2  
    - E not in position 3  
    - I not in position 4  
    - N not in position 5  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: T, E, I, N (all must appear).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S.  
- **Positional constraints**:  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.  
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2.  
  - I cannot be in position 4.  
- The word must include **one new letter** (not C, R, A, S, T, E, I, N).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word containing **T, E, I, N** + **one new letter** (e.g., L, D, M, P, O, etc.).  
- Avoid forbidden positions for known letters.  
- Prioritize common letters and test new positions:  
  - E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
  - T can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
  - I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  

### Chosen Guess: **INTEL**
- **I** in position 1 (allowed, not position 4).  
- **N** in position 2 (allowed, not position 4 or 5).  
- **T** in position 3 (allowed, not position 2).  
- **E** in position 4 (allowed, not position 3 or 5).  
- **L** (new letter) in position 5.  
- **Why this works**:  
  - Tests all known letters (T, E, I, N) in new, valid positions.  
  - Introduces **L** (high-frequency consonant) to probe for the last unknown letter.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, S) and adheres to positional constraints.",Guess 3: intel -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) T(-) E(✓) L(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,inlet,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in position 4 and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 We also note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we have to make a second guess. We know that the word has N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

 Since N is in the word (but not in position 4), it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, E is in the word (but not in position 5), so it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that the feedback doesn't prevent E from being in position 4? Actually, in the first guess, E was in position 5 and we got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 4? Actually, position 4 was taken by N and we know N is not in the correct position there, but that doesn't conflict with E being elsewhere.

 Also, we have eliminated three letters: C, R, A.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Contains N and E (since we know they are in the word) and three new letters.
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - We can try to put N and E in new positions to get more information.

 Additionally, we should consider common letters. Since we have two letters already (N and E), we can try to cover more frequent letters.

 Possible positions for N: we tried position 4 and it was wrong. So we can try putting N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.
 Similarly, E was tried in position 5 and was wrong, so we can try positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

 However, note: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have two '-' for N and E. That means they must appear in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So if we put N in the same position again, it would be a waste? Actually, we are required to make a valid word.

 Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.

 Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that have N and E and don't use C, R, A.

 Some examples: 
   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don't know about S, P, I yet.
   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let's form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.

 However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.

 Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don't have much constraint.

 Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don't know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven't tried E at position 1 yet.

 But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got '-' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.

 But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can't ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it's not required to reuse all known letters, but it's a good strategy because we can get more information about them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.

 How about ""LINEN""? It has two N's? But we don't know if the word has two N's? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one '-', so that doesn't tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it's better to use distinct letters.

 But ""LINEN"" has two N's and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.

 But let me check: ""LINEN"": 
   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

 But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn't been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.

 So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:
   N in position 3? That hasn't been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That's new.

 But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.

 Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? 

 Other words: 
   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? 
   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.

 We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.

 List: 
   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)
   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   We haven't tried E in position 2, and we haven't tried N in position 5? So that's okay.

   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.

   This word introduces B, G, I.

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). 
   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a '-', meaning it's not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it's wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it's wrong.

   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.

 Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it's in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we'll get '-' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we'll get either '-' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be '-' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.

   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.

 Therefore, possible words: 
   We can try: 
     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)
     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)

 So let's pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.

 ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?
   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.

 How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don't have to, but then we wouldn't get information about E? And we know E is present? So it's better to include E? Because if we don't, then we don't know about the position of E? So we should.

 So let's consider: 
   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? 
   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). 
   But wait: what about E? We haven't tried position 4 for E? So that's good? 
   And N: we haven't tried position 3? So that's good? 
   Also, introduces M, I, D.

   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.

   Let's check: 
      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.

   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as 'x', so not present. So avoid C.

 How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position 
   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? 
   So that's okay? 
   But note: we haven't tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? 
   Also, introduces U, S, T.

   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.

 However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don't know? But common.

 But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? 

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? 
   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it's not there? 
   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? 

 We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.

 How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? 
   Positions: 
      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? 
      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? 
   So that works? 
   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.

   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.

   Similarly, E at 3? new.

   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it's a valid guess? 

   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? 
   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.

   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn't tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? 
   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? 

   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.

   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as 'x'. So avoid A.

   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.

   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. 

   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.

   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? 

   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn't get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don't know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? 

   We should try to cover positions we haven't covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? 

   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? 

   Considering: ""STEIN"" 
      Position1: S (new)
      Position2: T (new)
      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don't know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don't know? 
      Position4: I (new)
      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn't been tested? 

   So if we get feedback: 
        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's not? Then we get '-' if E is somewhere else? 
        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it's in the word but not at 5? Then '-'? 

   Also, we learn about S, T, I? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": 
        Position1: B (new)
        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn't tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then '-'? )
        Position3: G (new)
        Position4: I (new)
        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else '-'? )

   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? 

   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? 

   But let me check: The first guess didn't reveal any letter? So the secret word's first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? 

   We don't have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It's good? 

   Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? 

   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? 

   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven't used mandatory N? So we must include N? 

   So ""STEIN"" seems good? 

   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? 

   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? 

   So we must include N? 

   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? 

   So our guess: ""STEIN""

   Let me write the guess: STEIN

   Expected positions: 
        S at 1? 
        T at 2?
        E at 3?
        I at 4?
        N at 5?

   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven't done? And N in position 5? which we haven't done? 

   So it should be okay?

   We'll see the feedback and make the next guess accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
  
For the second guess, we need a word that includes N and E (since they're confirmed present) and avoids C, R, A. We should also prioritize:
- Testing N in a new position (not 4)
- Testing E in a new position (not 5)
- Introducing new high-frequency letters like S, T, or I.
  
A strong candidate is **""stein""** (valid 5-letter word):  
- Places E in position 3 (new, untested position)  
- Places N in position 5 (new, untested position)  
- Introduces S, T, I (common letters not yet tested)  
- Avoids C, R, A.  

This guess efficiently probes new letters and placement for the known letters N and E.

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""stein"":
  S: x -> not in the word
  T: - -> in the word but wrong position
  E: - -> in the word but wrong position (but note: we already knew E was in the word from the first guess)
  I: - -> in the word but wrong position
  N: - -> in the word but wrong position (but we already knew N was in the word)

So, to summarize:
- S is not in the word at all.
- T, E, I, N are in the word, but none of them are in the positions we guessed in ""stein"":
    T is not in position 2
    E is not in position 3
    I is not in position 4
    N is not in position 5

Additionally, from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- C, R, A are not in the word.
- N is not in position 4 (already known, and now also not in position 5 from this guess).
- E is not in position 5 (already known, and now also not in position 3 from this guess).

So, the letters we know are in the word: T, E, I, N (and we already had E and N from before, now we add T and I).

We also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, S.

We have two guesses so far, and we have 6 tries total, so we are on the third guess.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word.
- Contains T, E, I, N (since all are in the word) and one new letter (because we have 4 known letters and one unknown).
- Avoids C, R, A, S.
- Does not place T in position 2, E in position 3, I in position 4, N in position 5 (because we know they are wrong for these positions).
- Also, from the first guess, we know N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

Moreover, we have to consider the positions that are still possible for each letter.

Let's list the possible positions for each known letter:

For T:
  We know T is not in position 2 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried T in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? 
  But note: in the first guess, we had no T? So we only have the constraint from the second guess: not position 2.

For E:
  We know E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""stein"").
  So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.
  Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

For I:
  We know I is not in position 4 (from ""stein"").
  We haven't tried I in other positions? So I can be in 1, 2, 3, 5.

For N:
  We know N is not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""stein"").
  So N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
  Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Now, we have to include all four: T, E, I, N, and one new letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter that we haven't tried? But we have to avoid C, R, A, S.

We also note that the word must have exactly these five letters? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? But we can't be sure? However, to maximize information, we try to use distinct letters? But we have to use T, E, I, N? and one more? So we need a word that has these four and one new letter? 

But wait: we have four known letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed? And we have to avoid C, R, A, S? 

We have guessed: 
  First guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know C,R,A are absent, and N,E are present.
  Second guess: S, T, E, I, N -> we know S is absent, and T, I are present (and we already knew E and N).

So the absent letters: C, R, A, S.

The present letters: T, E, I, N.

So the secret word must contain T, E, I, N and one more letter that is not C, R, A, S and not any of the present ones? Actually, the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't guessed? Or it could be one of the present ones? But we have four distinct letters? So the fifth is a new letter? 

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, two T's? But we don't have any indication? So we assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, we need a word that has T, E, I, N and one new letter (say X) that is not in {C, R, A, S} and not in {T, E, I, N}? So X is a letter we haven't tried? 

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So the new letter must be from the remaining letters? 

The alphabet: A to Z, minus the ones we've tried? 
  Tried: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T -> so missing: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can choose any of these? But we want a common letter? 

Now, we have to form a word with T, E, I, N and one new letter? And we have to assign them to positions 1 to 5? 

But we have constraints on the positions for E and N? 
  E: must be in 1, 2, or 4.
  N: must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Also, T: cannot be in 2? But can be in 1,3,4,5? 
I: cannot be in 4? But can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have to avoid placing any of these letters in the positions we know they are wrong? 

Now, we need to choose a word that satisfies these constraints? 

Let me try to think of words that have T, E, I, N and one more letter? 

For example, ""TEN"" is three letters? We need five? 

Possible words: 
  ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> 
      Letters: I, N, L, E, T -> that's the four known and L? 
      But we have to check positions? 
      We can assign: 
        I: can be in 1? 
        N: can be in 2? 
        L: new letter? 
        E: can be in 4? 
        T: can be in 5? 

      But we have to form the word ""INLET"": 
        I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

      Now, check constraints:
        T: in position 5? Is that allowed? We know T cannot be in position 2? 5 is okay? 
        E: in position 4? We know E can be in 4? (since E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in position 1? We know I cannot be in 4? 1 is okay? 
        N: in position 2? We know N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is okay? 

      Also, we are introducing L? which is new? 

      So ""INLET"" seems a candidate? 

  But note: we have to avoid S? and we do? 

  Another candidate: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> 
      Letters: U, N, I, T, E -> that's the four and U? 
      Word: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5)? 
      But wait: E is in position 5? We know E cannot be in position 5? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      Alternatively, we can form ""UNITE"" as U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at 5 is forbidden? 

      How about ""UNTIE"": U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? forbidden? 

      So we cannot have E at 5? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": but missing E? 

  Another: ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)? 
      But E is in position 3? We know E cannot be in position 3? (from ""stein"" feedback: E at 3 was marked as wrong position? meaning E is not at 3? So we cannot put E at 3 again? 

      So ""INEPT"" with E at 3 is invalid? 

      But if we rearrange? The word must be a valid English word? 

  How about ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> missing E? 

  We must have E? 

  Another: ""TOWIE""? not a word? 

  ""TINE"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENOR"": has R? R is not allowed? 

  ""TIGER"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""TIDES"": has S? not allowed? 

  ""TILED"": T, I, L, E, D -> 
      Letters: T, I, L, E, D -> that's T, I, E and L and D? But we are missing N? We must have N? 

  So we must include N? 

  Back to ""INLET"": it has I, N, L, E, T -> that's all four? 

  Another: ""ELINT"" (a word? meaning electronic intelligence) -> E, L, I, N, T -> 
      We can assign: 
        E in 1? -> allowed? (E can be in 1,2,4) -> 1 is allowed? 
        L in 2? 
        I in 3? 
        N in 4? -> but wait: N cannot be in position 4? (from first guess) -> so invalid? 

      If we try to rearrange? But the word is fixed? 

  ""ELINT"" is E(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N in 4? not allowed? 

  How about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> 
      L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
      Check constraints:
        N: in 3? allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 3 is allowed)
        E: in 4? allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
        I: in 2? allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 2 is allowed)
        T: missing? we must have T? 

  But ""LINED"" does not have T? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need a word with T, E, I, N and one more? 

  How about ""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> missing N? 

  ""TINED""? not a word? 

  ""TINY"" is 4 letters? 

  ""TENCH""? has C? not allowed? 

  ""BENT"" is 4? 

  ""INLET"" seems the best so far? 

  But let me check: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

  Constraints:
    I: position 1 -> allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 1 is allowed) 
    N: position 2 -> allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is allowed)
    L: new letter? 
    E: position 4 -> allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)
    T: position 5 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 5 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 5? 

  Also, we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So ""INLET"" is a valid guess? 

  But note: we are putting T in position 5? and we know T is in the word? but we haven't tried T in 5? so that's okay? 

  Another candidate: ""OWING"" -> missing T and E? 

  ""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> 
      T(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
        N in 4? not allowed? 
        E in 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""TWICE"": has C? not allowed? 

  ""QUITE"": Q, U, I, T, E -> missing N? 

  ""TRITE"": has R? not allowed? 

  ""WHITE"": missing N? 

  ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> has R? not allowed? 

  ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> 
      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5) -> 
        E in 3? not allowed? (from ""stein"", E at 3 was wrong) 
        N in 2? allowed? 
        T in 5? allowed? 
        But E in 3 is forbidden? 

  How about ""NITER"": has R? 

  ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> missing N? 

  ""MINED"": M, I, N, E, D -> 
      M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> 
        This has T? no? 

  We must have T? 

  So we need T? 

  After some thought, ""INLET"" seems a good candidate? 

  But let me see if there is a word that uses a more common letter? 

  ""TITLE"": T, I, T, L, E -> duplicate T? and missing N? 

  ""LENT"" is 4? 

  ""INTEL"": I, N, T, E, L -> 
      I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), L(5) -> 
        Check constraints:
          I: 1 -> allowed
          N: 2 -> allowed (1,2,3)
          T: 3 -> allowed? (T can be in 1,3,4,5 -> 3 is allowed? and we haven't tried T in 3? 
          E: 4 -> allowed? (1,2,4) -> 4 is allowed? 
          L: new? 
        Also, avoids C,R,A,S? 

      So ""INTEL"" is a valid word? 

      But note: we have T in position 3? and we haven't tried T in 3? 

      Also, we have I in 1? and we haven't tried I in 1? 

      This is similar to ""INLET""? 

      Actually, ""INTEL"" has the same letters? I,N,T,E,L? 

      But arranged as I,N,T,E,L? 

      So both ""INLET"" and ""INTEL"" are anagrams? 

      But ""INTEL"" is a proper noun? But Wordle accepts it? 

      We can use either? 

      Let me choose ""INTEL"" because it has T in the middle? 

      But note: in ""INTEL"", we are putting T in position 3? and we know T is not in position 2? but 3 is new? 

      Also, E in 4? which is allowed? 

      So both are acceptable? 

      I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's a common word? 

  But wait: we have to consider the feedback we might get? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we cannot because of E at 5? 

  Another word: ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> 
      U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> 
        E at 5? not allowed? 

  How about ""UNLIT"": no E? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good choice? 

  But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong? 

  In ""INTEL"": 
      I at 1: we haven't tried I at 1? 
      N at 2: we haven't tried N at 2? 
      T at 3: we haven't tried T at 3? 
      E at 4: we haven't tried E at 4? 
      L at 5: new? 

  And we know E can be at 4? and N can be at 2? 

  So it's valid? 

  Therefore, we guess ""INTEL"". 

  But let me double-check: 
      We know T is in the word? and we are putting it at 3? 
      We know E is in the word? and we put at 4? 
      We know I is in the word? and we put at 1? 
      We know N is in the word? and we put at 2? 

  And L is new? 

  And we avoid C, R, A, S? 

  So yes? 

  But note: the word ""INTEL"" is 5 letters? 

  So we'll go with that? 

  However, what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But we have to try? 

  Alternatively, we might consider ""TENOR"" but R is not allowed? 

  So I think ""INTEL"" is a good guess? 

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter in a position we haven't tried? 

  We are trying I at 1, N at 2, T at 3, E at 4, L at 5? 

  We might get some correct? 

  So let's make the guess: ""INTEL""

  But note: we have to output in the format: <guess>intel</guess>? 

  However, let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel? But we have I and E? 

  Another candidate: ""OFTEN"": O, F, T, E, N -> 
      O(1), F(2), T(3), E(4), N(5) -> 
        But N at 5? not allowed? (from ""stein"", N at 5 was wrong) -> so invalid? 

  ""OFTEN"" has N at 5? which we know is wrong? 

  So no? 

  Therefore, I choose ""INTEL"". 

  But wait: what about ""INLET""? It's also valid? 

  Actually, ""INLET"" has the same set of letters? and we can form: 
      I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> 
        T at 5? which is allowed? 

  But in ""INTEL"", we have T at 3? 

  Which one is better? 

  We know that T cannot be at 2? but we haven't tried T at 3 or 5? 

  Similarly, we haven't tried E at 4? 

  So both are equally good? 

  But note: in ""INTEL"", we are trying T at 3? and in ""INLET"", we are trying T at 5? 

  We don't have any information about T at 3 or 5? 

  So we can choose either? 

  I'll go with ""INTEL"" because it's more common? 

  But let me check: ""INTEL"" is a brand? but it's accepted? 

  Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose ""INLET""? 

  But I think both are acceptable? 

  I'll choose ""INTEL"". 

  So the guess is ""INTEL"". 

  But note: the feedback from the second guess: 
      S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)

  So we know T, E, I, N are present? 

  And we are using them? 

  So we are good? 

  Let's output: <guess>intel</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)`  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the word.  
  - **N and E** are **present** but in the wrong positions (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → Feedback: `S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)`  
  - **S** is **absent**.  
  - **T, E, I, N** are **present** but in the wrong positions:  
    - T not in position 2  
    - E not in position 3  
    - I not in position 4  
    - N not in position 5  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: T, E, I, N (all must appear).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S.  
- **Positional constraints**:  
  - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.  
  - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.  
  - T cannot be in position 2.  
  - I cannot be in position 4.  
- The word must include **one new letter** (not C, R, A, S, T, E, I, N).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Use a word containing **T, E, I, N** + **one new letter** (e.g., L, D, M, P, O, etc.).  
- Avoid forbidden positions for known letters.  
- Prioritize common letters and test new positions:  
  - E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
  - T can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
  - I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  

### Chosen Guess: **INTEL**
- **I** in position 1 (allowed, not position 4).  
- **N** in position 2 (allowed, not position 4 or 5).  
- **T** in position 3 (allowed, not position 2).  
- **E** in position 4 (allowed, not position 3 or 5).  
- **L** (new letter) in position 5.  
- **Why this works**:  
  - Tests all known letters (T, E, I, N) in new, valid positions.  
  - Introduces **L** (high-frequency consonant) to probe for the last unknown letter.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, S) and adheres to positional constraints.

Actually, we are required to make a valid word.\n\n Since we have two known letters, we should try to use them and also test new letters.\n\n Also, note that the word must be 5 letters and not contain C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have N and E and don\'t use C, R, A.\n\n Some examples: \n   - ""SPINE"": has S, P, I, N, E -> we can use this? But note: we don\'t know about S, P, I yet.\n   - ""INEPT"": has I, N, E, P, T -> but note that E is in position 3 and N in position 2? Actually, let\'s form: positions: I in 1, N in 2, E in 3, P in 4, T in 5.\n\n However, consider our feedback: we know N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong, so if we put N in position 2 now, that might be acceptable. Similarly, E was in position 5 and we now put in position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider words that put N and E in positions that were not tried. But we don\'t have much constraint.\n\n Another candidate: ""EXIST"" -> but we are avoiding R? Actually, ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> avoids C,R,A? Also, E is at position 1? But wait, we don\'t know if E can be at position 1? Actually, we haven\'t tried E at position 1 yet.\n\n But note: in the first guess, E was at position 5 and we got \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at 5. It could be at 1. However, we also know that N must be in the word but not at 4.\n\n But ""EXIST"" does not contain N, so we cannot use that because we must include N? Actually, we know N is in the word, so we can\'t ignore it. We have to use N and E in our guess? Actually, it\'s not required to reuse all known letters, but it\'s a good strategy because we can get more information about them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word without one of them, but that would waste an opportunity to gain positional information. So we should include both N and E.\n\n How about ""LINEN""? It has two N\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one N (because we had only one). But the secret word might have two? However, we guessed only one N and it showed one \'-\', so that doesn\'t tell us. But we should try to avoid repeating letters unless necessary? To maximize information, it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\n But ""LINEN"" has two N\'s and also the letter L and I. However, we have no information about L and I, and note that L and I are vowels/consonants? Also, we know A, R, C are missing. L is allowed? Yes.\n\n But let me check: ""LINEN"": \n   L in 1, I in 2, N in 3, E in 4, N in 5.\n\n But note: we have E in position 4? We know E must be in the word but not in position 5? Position 4 hasn\'t been tried for E. And we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But in ""LINEN"", we are putting N in positions 3 and 5, and E in 4.\n\n So, if we use ""LINEN"", we are putting:\n   N in position 3? That hasn\'t been tried? And N in position 5? Also, E in position 4? That\'s new.\n\n But wait: the word ""LINEN"" has L, I, N, E, N. So we are introducing L and I.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose a word that uses more common consonants? \n\n Other words: \n   ""NEEDS"" -> but repeats E? and S? Also, N is in position 1? \n   ""SENT"" -> too short? Must be 5 letters.\n\n We need a 5-letter word that includes N and E and does not contain C, R, A.\n\n List: \n   BEGIN -> B,E,G,I,N -> positions: B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5)\n   But note: E in position 2? and N in position 5? \n   We haven\'t tried E in position 2, and we haven\'t tried N in position 5? So that\'s okay.\n\n   However, we know E is not in position 5? Yes. And N is not in position 4? Yes.\n\n   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C, R, A.\n\n   This word introduces B, G, I.\n\n Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O,P,I,N,E -> O(1),P(2),I(3),N(4),E(5). \n   But we know N was already tried in position 4 and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s not in position 4? So if we put N in position 4 again, it will be a waste? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said position 4 was N and it\'s wrong, so putting N in position 4 again will likely be wrong again? But we have to avoid repeating the same position if we know it\'s wrong.\n\n   So we should not put N in position 4 again. Therefore, ""OPINE"" is not good because we put N in position 4.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put E in position 5? Yes, we know that E is not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 again would be wrong? Actually, we can try? But the feedback already told us it\'s in the word but not at 5. So if we put it at 5, we know we\'ll get \'-\' again? Actually, no: if we put it at 5 and the secret word has E at 5? no, because we know E is not at 5. So we\'ll get either \'-\' at 5 again? Actually, no: the symbol for E at 5 would be \'-\' again only if E is still not at 5? But we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information? So we should avoid putting E in position 5? Similarly for N in position 4?.\n\n   So we avoid positions that we know are wrong for these letters.\n\n Therefore, possible words: \n   We can try: \n     N in positions 1, 2, 3, 5? (avoiding 4)\n     E in positions 1, 2, 3, 4? (avoiding 5)\n\n So let\'s pick a word that puts N and E in new positions and introduces three new letters.\n\n ""NOISE"": N(1),O(2),I(3),S(4),E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? We must avoid E in position 5 for sure? Because we know from the previous feedback that E is not in position 5?\n   So this is invalid: we would be putting E in position 5 again? It will not be the correct position. But we can still use the word? However, we want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So avoid known wrong positions.\n\n How about ""NOISY""? No E? But we need to use E? Actually, we don\'t have to, but then we wouldn\'t get information about E? And we know E is present? So it\'s better to include E? Because if we don\'t, then we don\'t know about the position of E? So we should.\n\n So let\'s consider: \n   ""MINED"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> This avoids E in position 5 and N in position 4? \n   Yes: N at 3 (not 4), E at 4 (not 5). \n   But wait: what about E? We haven\'t tried position 4 for E? So that\'s good? \n   And N: we haven\'t tried position 3? So that\'s good? \n   Also, introduces M, I, D.\n\n   But note: the word ""MINED"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\n   Let\'s check: \n      M, I, N, E, D -> All distinct? Yes.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ONCE""? but has C? We already know C is not in the word? In the first guess, C was marked as \'x\', so not present. So avoid C.\n\n How about ""UNSET"": U(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5) -> \n   N at position 2? (we had at 4 previously? we avoid 4) -> new position \n   E at position 4? -> new position? and avoids position 5? \n   So that\'s okay? \n   But note: we haven\'t tried position 4 for E? Actually, we tried E at position 5? So 4 is new for E? \n   Also, introduces U, S, T.\n\n   But wait: the word ""UNSET"" is valid? Yes.\n\n However, note that the secret word might have S or T? We don\'t know? But common.\n\n But in our feedback from first guess, we know that the word does not contain A, R, C? So U, S, T are okay? \n\n Another candidate: ""STONE"": S(1), T(2), O(3), N(4), E(5)? \n   But here we put N in position 4? That was tried and found wrong? So we know it\'s not there? \n   Also, E in position 5? That was also tried and wrong? So bad? \n\n We must avoid that? So ""STONE"" is not good.\n\n How about ""STEIN"": S(1), T(2), E(3), I(4), N(5)? \n   Positions: \n      E at 3 -> not 5? okay? \n      N at 5 -> not 4? okay? \n   So that works? \n   Also, S, T, E, I, N -> distinct? Yes.\n\n   But wait: N was only known to be not in 4? 5 is a new position? Yes.\n\n   Similarly, E at 3? new.\n\n   So ""STEIN"" is a valid word? Yes, an alternative spelling? Actually, in Wordle, it\'s a valid guess? \n\n   Another candidate: ""BEING"": B(1), E(2), I(3), N(4), G(5)? \n   But N in position 4? That we know is wrong? From first guess? So we avoid.\n\n   ""BEGIN"": B(1), E(2), G(3), I(4), N(5) -> N in position 5? That wasn\'t tried? And E in position 2? Not tried? \n   So avoid position 4? So we are safe? \n\n   Also, ""BEGIN"" avoids C,R,A? Yes.\n\n   We might also consider ""STAIN"": but has A? A is not in the word? Because the first guess had A marked as \'x\'. So avoid A.\n\n   So now, we choose between ""STEIN"", ""UNSET"", ""MINED"", ""BEGIN"" etc.\n\n   We want to cover more common letters? Letters like S, T, L, N, E are common? But we know N and E are already present. \n\n   We might introduce S, T? Because they are common.\n\n   So ""STEIN"": has S, T, E, I, N -> which contains both N and E? and S, T, I? \n\n   Also, note: in the first guess, we didn\'t get any hits at positions 1,2,3? That is, letters C, R, A were wrong? So the secret word has no letters in position 1,2,3? Actually, we don\'t know that? It might have other letters? We only know that C,R,A are missing? \n\n   We should try to cover positions we haven\'t covered? Actually, we covered all positions? In the first guess we covered: position1: C, position2: R, position3: A, position4: N, position5: E? So we got two letters that are present? but in the wrong positions? \n\n   For second guess, we can choose a word that tests new letters? \n\n   Considering: ""STEIN"" \n      Position1: S (new)\n      Position2: T (new)\n      Position3: E (we put E there? We know E is in the word? But we don\'t know where? If it is in position 3, then we get a ✓? But we don\'t know? \n      Position4: I (new)\n      Position5: N (new? We know N is in the word? But not position 4? Position 5 hasn\'t been tested? \n\n   So if we get feedback: \n        If E is at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s not? Then we get \'-\' if E is somewhere else? \n        Similarly for N at position 5: If N is at 5, then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but not at 5? Then \'-\'? \n\n   Also, we learn about S, T, I? \n\n   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"": \n        Position1: B (new)\n        Position2: E (we try E at 2? which wasn\'t tried? If E is at 2, then ✓. If not? Then \'-\'? )\n        Position3: G (new)\n        Position4: I (new)\n        Position5: N (new? If N is at 5, ✓? else \'-\'? )\n\n   Both are good? But ""STEIN"" introduces S and T? Which are very common? So we might get more information? \n\n   Also, note the secret word: we know from first guess that the first letter is not C, so S or T? Not necessarily? \n\n   But let me check: The first guess didn\'t reveal any letter? So the secret word\'s first letter could be S? Or T? Or many others? \n\n   We don\'t have any constraint on position 1? So testing S and T? It\'s good? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".\n\n   But note: the word ""STEIN"" is valid? Yes, it means a beer mug? But sometimes used? \n\n   Alternatively, ""BEGIN"" is also good? \n\n   How about ""STOLE"": but without E at ending? Actually, we would use E? But we know E is in the word? So we want to test E? And in ""STOLE"", we put E at position 4? But wait: we haven\'t used mandatory N? So we must include N? \n\n   So ""STEIN"" seems good? \n\n   But wait: what if we get lucky and the word is ""STEIN""? But more importantly, we are introducing common consonants? \n\n   Another option: ""SLIME"": but without N? We skip N? We know N is present? So we want to include? \n\n   So we must include N? \n\n   Therefore, I will choose ""STEIN"".\n\n   But note: the word must be 5 letters? And ""STEIN"" is 5 letters? \n\n   So our guess: ""STEIN""\n\n   Let me write the guess: STEIN\n\n   Expected positions: \n        S at 1? \n        T at 2?\n        E at 3?\n        I at 4?\n        N at 5?\n\n   We are trying E in position 3? which we haven\'t done? And N in position 5? which we haven\'t done? \n\n   So it should be okay?\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and make the next guess accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: x, N: -, E: -), we know:\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n  \nFor the second guess, we need a word that includes N and E (since they\'re confirmed present) and avoids C, R, A. We should also prioritize:\n- Testing N in a new position (not 4)\n- Testing E in a new position (not 5)\n- Introducing new high-frequency letters like S, T, or I.\n  \nA strong candidate is **""stein""** (valid 5-letter word):  \n- Places E in position 3 (new, untested position)  \n- Places N in position 5 (new, untested position)  \n- Introduces S, T, I (common letters not yet tested)  \n- Avoids C, R, A.  \n\nThis guess efficiently probes new letters and placement for the known letters N and E.\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""stein"":\n  S: x -> not in the word\n  T: - -> in the word but wrong position\n  E: - -> in the word but wrong position (but note: we already knew E was in the word from the first guess)\n  I: - -> in the word but wrong position\n  N: - -> in the word but wrong position (but we already knew N was in the word)\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- S is not in the word at all.\n- T, E, I, N are in the word, but none of them are in the positions we guessed in ""stein"":\n    T is not in position 2\n    E is not in position 3\n    I is not in position 4\n    N is not in position 5\n\nAdditionally, from the first guess ""crane"", we know:\n- C, R, A are not in the word.\n- N is not in position 4 (already known, and now also not in position 5 from this guess).\n- E is not in position 5 (already known, and now also not in position 3 from this guess).\n\nSo, the letters we know are in the word: T, E, I, N (and we already had E and N from before, now we add T and I).\n\nWe also know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, S.\n\nWe have two guesses so far, and we have 6 tries total, so we are on the third guess.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Is a 5-letter word.\n- Contains T, E, I, N (since all are in the word) and one new letter (because we have 4 known letters and one unknown).\n- Avoids C, R, A, S.\n- Does not place T in position 2, E in position 3, I in position 4, N in position 5 (because we know they are wrong for these positions).\n- Also, from the first guess, we know N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.\n\nMoreover, we have to consider the positions that are still possible for each letter.\n\nLet\'s list the possible positions for each known letter:\n\nFor T:\n  We know T is not in position 2 (from ""stein"").\n  We haven\'t tried T in positions 1, 3, 4, 5? \n  But note: in the first guess, we had no T? So we only have the constraint from the second guess: not position 2.\n\nFor E:\n  We know E is not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""stein"").\n  So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5.\n  Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nFor I:\n  We know I is not in position 4 (from ""stein"").\n  We haven\'t tried I in other positions? So I can be in 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nFor N:\n  We know N is not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 5 (from ""stein"").\n  So N cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n  Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nNow, we have to include all four: T, E, I, N, and one new letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter that we haven\'t tried? But we have to avoid C, R, A, S.\n\nWe also note that the word must have exactly these five letters? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates? So we assume distinct? But we can\'t be sure? However, to maximize information, we try to use distinct letters? But we have to use T, E, I, N? and one more? So we need a word that has these four and one new letter? \n\nBut wait: we have four known letters? So the fifth letter must be one we haven\'t guessed? And we have to avoid C, R, A, S? \n\nWe have guessed: \n  First guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we know C,R,A are absent, and N,E are present.\n  Second guess: S, T, E, I, N -> we know S is absent, and T, I are present (and we already knew E and N).\n\nSo the absent letters: C, R, A, S.\n\nThe present letters: T, E, I, N.\n\nSo the secret word must contain T, E, I, N and one more letter that is not C, R, A, S and not any of the present ones? Actually, the fifth letter must be a letter we haven\'t guessed? Or it could be one of the present ones? But we have four distinct letters? So the fifth is a new letter? \n\nBut note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, two T\'s? But we don\'t have any indication? So we assume no duplicates? \n\nTherefore, we need a word that has T, E, I, N and one new letter (say X) that is not in {C, R, A, S} and not in {T, E, I, N}? So X is a letter we haven\'t tried? \n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, I. So the new letter must be from the remaining letters? \n\nThe alphabet: A to Z, minus the ones we\'ve tried? \n  Tried: A, C, E, I, N, R, S, T -> so missing: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can choose any of these? But we want a common letter? \n\nNow, we have to form a word with T, E, I, N and one new letter? And we have to assign them to positions 1 to 5? \n\nBut we have constraints on the positions for E and N? \n  E: must be in 1, 2, or 4.\n  N: must be in 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, T: cannot be in 2? But can be in 1,3,4,5? \nI: cannot be in 4? But can be in 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also have to avoid placing any of these letters in the positions we know they are wrong? \n\nNow, we need to choose a word that satisfies these constraints? \n\nLet me try to think of words that have T, E, I, N and one more letter? \n\nFor example, ""TEN"" is three letters? We need five? \n\nPossible words: \n  ""INLET"": I, N, L, E, T -> \n      Letters: I, N, L, E, T -> that\'s the four known and L? \n      But we have to check positions? \n      We can assign: \n        I: can be in 1? \n        N: can be in 2? \n        L: new letter? \n        E: can be in 4? \n        T: can be in 5? \n\n      But we have to form the word ""INLET"": \n        I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.\n\n      Now, check constraints:\n        T: in position 5? Is that allowed? We know T cannot be in position 2? 5 is okay? \n        E: in position 4? We know E can be in 4? (since E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)\n        I: in position 1? We know I cannot be in 4? 1 is okay? \n        N: in position 2? We know N must be in 1,2,3 -> 2 is okay? \n\n      Also, we are introducing L? which is new? \n\n      So ""INLET"" seems a candidate? \n\n  But note: we have to avoid S? and we do? \n\n  Another candidate: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> \n      Letters: U, N, I, T, E -> that\'s the four and U? \n      Word: U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5)? \n      But wait: E is in position 5? We know E cannot be in position 5? (from first guess) -> so invalid? \n\n      Alternatively, we can form ""UNITE"" as U(1), N(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at 5 is forbidden? \n\n      How about ""UNTIE"": U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5) -> again E at 5? forbidden? \n\n      So we cannot have E at 5? \n\n  How about ""UNLIT"": but missing E? \n\n  Another: ""INEPT"": I, N, E, P, T -> \n      I(1), N(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)? \n      But E is in position 3? We know E cannot be in position 3? (from ""stein"" feedback: E at 3 was marked as wrong position? meaning E is not at 3? So we cannot put E at 3 again? \n\n      So ""INEPT"" with E at 3 is invalid? \n\n      But if we rearrange? The word must be a valid English word? \n\n  How about ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> missing E? \n\n  We must have E? \n\n  Another: ""TOWIE""? not a word? \n\n  ""TINE"" is 4 letters? \n\n  ""TENOR"": has R? R is not allowed? \n\n  ""TIGER"": has R? not allowed? \n\n  ""TIDES"": has S? not allowed? \n\n  ""TILED"": T, I, L, E, D -> \n      Letters: T, I, L, E, D -> that\'s T, I, E and L and D? But we are missing N? We must have N? \n\n  So we must include N? \n\n  Back to ""INLET"": it has I, N, L, E, T -> that\'s all four? \n\n  Another: ""ELINT"" (a word? meaning electronic intelligence) -> E, L, I, N, T -> \n      We can assign: \n        E in 1? -> allowed? (E can be in 1,2,4) -> 1 is allowed? \n        L in 2? \n        I in 3? \n        N in 4? -> but wait: N cannot be in position 4? (from first guess) -> so invalid? \n\n      If we try to rearrange? But the word is fixed? \n\n  ""ELINT"" is E(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> N in 4? not allowed? \n\n  How about ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> \n      L(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> \n      Check constraints:\n        N: in 3? allowed? (N must be in 1,2,3 -> 3 is allowed)\n        E: in 4? allowed? (E must be in 1,2,4 -> 4 is allowed)\n        I: in 2? allowed? (I can be in 1,2,3,5 -> 2 is allowed)\n        T: missing? we must have T? \n\n  But ""LINED"" does not have T? \n\n  We must have T? \n\n  So we need a word with T, E, I, N and one more? \n\n  How about ""TILDE"": T, I, L, D, E -> missing N? \n\n  ""TINED""? not a word? \n\n  ""TINY"" is 4 letters? \n\n  ""TENCH""? has C? not allowed? \n\n  ""BENT"" is 4? \n\n  ""INLET"" seems the best so far? \n\n  But let me check: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n  Constraints:\n    I: position 1 -> allowed?

We are given feedback for the third guess ""intel"":
  I(✓) -> I is in the correct position (position 1)
  N(✓) -> N is in the correct position (position 2)
  T(-) -> T is in the word but wrong position (position 3)
  E(✓) -> E is in the correct position (position 4)
  L(-) -> L is in the word but wrong position (position 5)

So, we know:
- The secret word has I in position 1, N in position 2, and E in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- The word contains T, E, I, N, and L (since L is now confirmed present).
- The word does not contain C, R, A, S.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: I _ N _ E
- Position 1: I (fixed)
- Position 2: N (fixed)
- Position 3: ? (but we know it cannot be T, because T is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback says T is in the word but not in position 3, so position 3 is not T. But we don't know what it is yet.)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (but we know L is in the word and not in position 5, so position 5 is not L. Also, we know T is not in position 5? Not necessarily? We only know T is not in position 3? It could be in position 5? But we have position 5 open.)

We also know that T must be in the word, but not in position 3. The only positions left are position 3 and 5? But position 3 is the only one that is not fixed? Actually, positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.

But note: we have two unknowns: position 3 and position 5. And we have two letters that must be placed: T and L? But we know the word has exactly these five letters? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have evidence of duplicates? 

We know the word has I, N, T, E, L? And we have five positions? So the word must be composed of these five letters? 

But we have two positions open: position 3 and 5? And two letters to place: T and L? 

But we know T cannot be in position 3? So T must be in position 5? And then L must be in position 3? 

But we also know L cannot be in position 5? So if we put T in position 5 and L in position 3, then:

  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: T

So the word would be ""INLET"".

But we have to check if that matches all constraints? 

From the feedback of the third guess ""intel"", we had:
  I(✓) -> correct
  N(✓) -> correct
  T(-) -> T is present but not in position 3? In ""INLET"", T is in position 5? So that would be okay? 
  E(✓) -> correct
  L(-) -> L is present but not in position 5? In ""INLET"", L is in position 3? So that would be okay? 

Also, we know from the first guess: 
  In ""crane"", we had N in position 4? But in ""INLET"", N is in position 2? That's fine? 
  And E in position 5? But in ""INLET"", E is in position 4? So that's fine? 

From the second guess ""stein"":
  We had T in position 2? But in ""INLET"", T is in position 5? So that's okay? 
  E in position 3? But in ""INLET"", E is in position 4? 
  I in position 4? But in ""INLET"", I is in position 1? 
  N in position 5? But in ""INLET"", N is in position 2? 

So all constraints are satisfied? 

Therefore, the secret word should be ""INLET"".

But let me confirm: 
  The word ""INLET"" has:
    I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

  Feedback for ""intel"" (which was I,N,T,E,L) would be:
    I(1) -> ✓
    N(2) -> ✓
    T(3) -> but in the secret word, position 3 is L, not T? So T is not at 3? But T is in the word at position 5? So we get '-' for T? 
    E(4) -> ✓
    L(5) -> but in the secret word, position 5 is T, not L? So L is not at 5? But L is in the word at position 3? So we get '-' for L? 

  That matches the feedback: I(✓) N(✓) T(-) E(✓) L(-)

Also, the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: not in ""INLET"" -> x
  R: not in -> x
  A: not in -> x
  N: in ""INLET"" at position 2? but we guessed at position 4? so not in position 4 -> -
  E: in ""INLET"" at position 4? but we guessed at position 5? so not in position 5 -> -

Second guess ""stein"":
  S: not in -> x
  T: in ""INLET"" at position 5? but we guessed at position 2? so not in position 2 -> -
  E: in ""INLET"" at position 4? but we guessed at position 3? so not in position 3 -> -
  I: in ""INLET"" at position 1? but we guessed at position 4? so not in position 4 -> -
  N: in ""INLET"" at position 2? but we guessed at position 5? so not in position 5 -> -

So everything matches.

Therefore, we can confidently guess ""INLET"" for the fourth guess.

But note: we are to make a new 5-letter word guess? And we are on the fourth guess? 

So we output: <guess>inlet</guess>

However, let me see if there is any other possibility? 

What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two T's? But we have no indication? And we have five distinct letters? 

But in this case, we have exactly the five letters: I, N, L, E, T? and we have placed them? 

So ""INLET"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore, we guess ""INLET"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)`  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent**.  
  - **N and E** are **present** but misplaced (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → Feedback: `S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)`  
  - **S** is **absent**.  
  - **T, E, I, N** are **present** but misplaced (T not in position 2, E not in position 3, I not in position 4, N not in position 5).  

- **Guess 3: INTEL** → Feedback: `I(✓) N(✓) T(-) E(✓) L(-)`  
  - **I, N, E** are **correct** in positions 1, 2, and 4.  
  - **T and L** are **present** but misplaced (T not in position 3, L not in position 5).  

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `I N _ E _`  
   - Position 1: **I** (fixed)  
   - Position 2: **N** (fixed)  
   - Position 4: **E** (fixed)  
   - Positions 3 and 5: Unknown, but must be **T** and **L** (since all 5 letters are now confirmed: I, N, T, E, L).  

2. **Positional constraints**:  
   - **T** cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - **L** cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - Thus, **T must be in position 5** and **L must be in position 3**.  

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S (eliminated from previous feedback).  

### Final Solution:
The only word fitting `I N _ E _` with **T** in position 5 and **L** in position 3 is **INLET**.  
- **I N L E T** → Positions: `I(1)`, `N(2)`, `L(3)`, `E(4)`, `T(5)`.  

This satisfies all constraints:  
- T is present but not in position 3 (it is in position 5).  
- L is present but not in position 5 (it is in position 3).  
- All previously absent letters (C, R, A, S) are avoided.  

<guess>inlet</guess>",inlet,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""intel"":
  I(✓) -> I is in the correct position (position 1)
  N(✓) -> N is in the correct position (position 2)
  T(-) -> T is in the word but wrong position (position 3)
  E(✓) -> E is in the correct position (position 4)
  L(-) -> L is in the word but wrong position (position 5)

So, we know:
- The secret word has I in position 1, N in position 2, and E in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- The word contains T, E, I, N, and L (since L is now confirmed present).
- The word does not contain C, R, A, S.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: I _ N _ E
- Position 1: I (fixed)
- Position 2: N (fixed)
- Position 3: ? (but we know it cannot be T, because T is not in position 3? Actually, the feedback says T is in the word but not in position 3, so position 3 is not T. But we don't know what it is yet.)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: ? (but we know L is in the word and not in position 5, so position 5 is not L. Also, we know T is not in position 5? Not necessarily? We only know T is not in position 3? It could be in position 5? But we have position 5 open.)

We also know that T must be in the word, but not in position 3. The only positions left are position 3 and 5? But position 3 is the only one that is not fixed? Actually, positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.

But note: we have two unknowns: position 3 and position 5. And we have two letters that must be placed: T and L? But we know the word has exactly these five letters? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have evidence of duplicates? 

We know the word has I, N, T, E, L? And we have five positions? So the word must be composed of these five letters? 

But we have two positions open: position 3 and 5? And two letters to place: T and L? 

But we know T cannot be in position 3? So T must be in position 5? And then L must be in position 3? 

But we also know L cannot be in position 5? So if we put T in position 5 and L in position 3, then:

  Position 1: I
  Position 2: N
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: T

So the word would be ""INLET"".

But we have to check if that matches all constraints? 

From the feedback of the third guess ""intel"", we had:
  I(✓) -> correct
  N(✓) -> correct
  T(-) -> T is present but not in position 3? In ""INLET"", T is in position 5? So that would be okay? 
  E(✓) -> correct
  L(-) -> L is present but not in position 5? In ""INLET"", L is in position 3? So that would be okay? 

Also, we know from the first guess: 
  In ""crane"", we had N in position 4? But in ""INLET"", N is in position 2? That's fine? 
  And E in position 5? But in ""INLET"", E is in position 4? So that's fine? 

From the second guess ""stein"":
  We had T in position 2? But in ""INLET"", T is in position 5? So that's okay? 
  E in position 3? But in ""INLET"", E is in position 4? 
  I in position 4? But in ""INLET"", I is in position 1? 
  N in position 5? But in ""INLET"", N is in position 2? 

So all constraints are satisfied? 

Therefore, the secret word should be ""INLET"".

But let me confirm: 
  The word ""INLET"" has:
    I in 1, N in 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

  Feedback for ""intel"" (which was I,N,T,E,L) would be:
    I(1) -> ✓
    N(2) -> ✓
    T(3) -> but in the secret word, position 3 is L, not T? So T is not at 3? But T is in the word at position 5? So we get '-' for T? 
    E(4) -> ✓
    L(5) -> but in the secret word, position 5 is T, not L? So L is not at 5? But L is in the word at position 3? So we get '-' for L? 

  That matches the feedback: I(✓) N(✓) T(-) E(✓) L(-)

Also, the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: not in ""INLET"" -> x
  R: not in -> x
  A: not in -> x
  N: in ""INLET"" at position 2? but we guessed at position 4? so not in position 4 -> -
  E: in ""INLET"" at position 4? but we guessed at position 5? so not in position 5 -> -

Second guess ""stein"":
  S: not in -> x
  T: in ""INLET"" at position 5? but we guessed at position 2? so not in position 2 -> -
  E: in ""INLET"" at position 4? but we guessed at position 3? so not in position 3 -> -
  I: in ""INLET"" at position 1? but we guessed at position 4? so not in position 4 -> -
  N: in ""INLET"" at position 2? but we guessed at position 5? so not in position 5 -> -

So everything matches.

Therefore, we can confidently guess ""INLET"" for the fourth guess.

But note: we are to make a new 5-letter word guess? And we are on the fourth guess? 

So we output: <guess>inlet</guess>

However, let me see if there is any other possibility? 

What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two T's? But we have no indication? And we have five distinct letters? 

But in this case, we have exactly the five letters: I, N, L, E, T? and we have placed them? 

So ""INLET"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore, we guess ""INLET"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)`  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent**.  
  - **N and E** are **present** but misplaced (N not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: STEIN** → Feedback: `S(x) T(-) E(-) I(-) N(-)`  
  - **S** is **absent**.  
  - **T, E, I, N** are **present** but misplaced (T not in position 2, E not in position 3, I not in position 4, N not in position 5).  

- **Guess 3: INTEL** → Feedback: `I(✓) N(✓) T(-) E(✓) L(-)`  
  - **I, N, E** are **correct** in positions 1, 2, and 4.  
  - **T and L** are **present** but misplaced (T not in position 3, L not in position 5).  

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `I N _ E _`  
   - Position 1: **I** (fixed)  
   - Position 2: **N** (fixed)  
   - Position 4: **E** (fixed)  
   - Positions 3 and 5: Unknown, but must be **T** and **L** (since all 5 letters are now confirmed: I, N, T, E, L).  

2. **Positional constraints**:  
   - **T** cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - **L** cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - Thus, **T must be in position 5** and **L must be in position 3**.  

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S (eliminated from previous feedback).  

### Final Solution:
The only word fitting `I N _ E _` with **T** in position 5 and **L** in position 3 is **INLET**.  
- **I N L E T** → Positions: `I(1)`, `N(2)`, `L(3)`, `E(4)`, `T(5)`.  

This satisfies all constraints:  
- T is present but not in position 3 (it is in position 5).  
- L is present but not in position 5 (it is in position 3).  
- All previously absent letters (C, R, A, S) are avoided.",Guess 4: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) L(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
