We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

We must avoid using C, A, and N in any new guess.

The word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We also know that E is in the word, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Includes the letter E (but not in the fifth position).
- Does not contain C, A, or N.

We want to test other common letters and positions to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E, and avoid C, A, N.

Some possibilities:
- ""PRESENT"" is 7 letters, too long.
- ""BREVE"" is 5 letters? But let's check: B R E V E -> 5 letters, but has two E's? Actually, ""breve"" is a word, but we have to consider the feedback.

But note: we have only 5 positions. We know E is in the word but not at the end. So let's try to put E in the first, third, or fourth position.

We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word:

Option 1: Put E in the first position: E R _ _ _
But we know E is not in the fifth, but we don't know about first. However, we have to avoid A, C, N.

Words: ERGOT, ERUPT, ERRED (but R is repeated, and we already know R is in the second position, so repeating R might not be efficient for information). 

But note: we are allowed to repeat letters? The rules don't say we can't, but to maximize information, we avoid repeating known correct letters unless necessary.

We know R is fixed in the second position, so we don't need to test it again. So we can avoid using R again? Actually, we can use other positions to test other letters.

But in this case, we have to have R in the second position.

Another idea: put E in the third position: _ R E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth.

Avoiding C, A, N.

Possible words: TREND (but N is not allowed, and we know N is not in the word), so no.

BREDE? Not a common word.

Put E in the fourth position: _ R _ E _

Words: ORBED (O R B E D) -> but we don't know if O, B, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T R I E D. This has E in the fourth position, which is allowed because we know E is not in the fifth. Also, it uses new letters: T, I, D.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, which we are.

So ""TRIED"" is a valid guess.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Second letter is R (correct).
- Contains E (in the fourth position, which is not the fifth, so okay).
- No C, A, N.

We can also consider other words like ""PRICE"" but C is not allowed.

""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E: but E is in the fifth position? We know E is not in the fifth because in the first guess, E was in the fifth and marked as wrong position. So if we put E in the fifth again, it would be incorrect. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in the fifth.

So ""DRIVE"" would put E in the fifth, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""BRINE"" -> but N is not allowed and E in fifth is not allowed.

So ""TRIED"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we are also allowed to use the letter E in the first position. For example, ""ERECT"" has E in first and then E again? But we don't know if E is repeated. Also, we have to avoid C.

""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> no C, A, N. And E is in the first position, which is not the fifth. This also tests U, P, T.

But we have two options: ""TRIED"" and ""ERUPT"". Which one is better?

We want to test as many new letters as possible. 

In ""TRIED"": new letters are T, I, E (we know E is present, but we are testing its position), D. So we test T, I, D.

In ""ERUPT"": new letters are E (known), R (known), U, P, T. So we test U, P, T.

But note: we already know R is in the second position, so we don't get new information about R. Similarly, E is known to be in the word, but we are testing its position.

In ""ERUPT"", we are putting E in the first position. If it turns out to be correct, we get a ✓, if not, we know E is not in the first.

Similarly, in ""TRIED"", we are putting E in the fourth position.

Both are valid. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

Another candidate: ""ROUSE"" -> R is in the first? But we need R in the second. So no.

""PRIME"" -> P R I M E: but E is in the fifth, which we know is wrong. So avoid.

""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: again, E in fifth.

So we must avoid E in the fifth.

Therefore, let's go with ""TRIED"".

But wait, we have another possibility: ""GREET"" -> G R E E T: but E is in the third and fourth? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, we are putting E in the third and fourth, but we know it's not in the fifth. However, we are repeating E, which might not be efficient.

So ""TRIED"" is better.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" is not common.

So I think ""TRIED"" is a good second guess.

But let's confirm: 
Guess: T R I E D

We are testing:
- T in first position
- R in second (already known, so we expect ✓)
- I in third position
- E in fourth position (we know E is in the word, but we are testing if it's in the fourth)
- D in fifth position

We will get feedback on T, I, E (position), and D.

If E is in the fourth, we get a ✓ for E? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a -.

But note: we know E is not in the fifth, but it could be in the first, third, or fourth.

By putting E in the fourth, we are testing that specific position.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first and I in the third.

So we are covering three new positions and one known position (R) and one new letter (D) in the fifth.

We are also testing D.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the first position to test that, like ""ERUPT"". But ""ERUPT"" uses U and P which are less common than T, I, D? 

In terms of letter frequency, in English:
T, I, D are common; U and P are less common than T and I.

But we are not sure. 

Since we have limited information, either is acceptable.

But let's go with ""TRIED"" because it uses more common letters.

So our second guess is ""TRIED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it's not in position 5).
- Avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.

For the second guess, I chose ""tried"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ _ (R is in the second position).
- It includes E in the fourth position (testing a possible location for E).
- It uses new, common letters (T, I, D) to gather more information.
- It avoids C, A, and N.

This guess will help test:
- T in position 1
- I in position 3
- E in position 4
- D in position 5
- While confirming R in position 2.

- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)

- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).

BREDE? Not a common word.

Another common word: ""TRIED"" -> T R I E D. This has E in the fourth position, which is allowed because we know E is not in the fifth. Also, it uses new letters: T, I, D.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, which we are.

So ""TRIED"" is a valid guess.

So ""DRIVE"" would put E in the fifth, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> no C, A, N. And E is in the first position, which is not the fifth. This also tests U, P, T.

- T in first position
- R in second (already known, so we expect ✓)
- I in third position
- E in fourth position (we know E is in the word, but we are testing if it's in the fourth)

We will get feedback on T, I, E (position), and D.

But note: we know E is not in the fifth, but it could be in the first, third, or fourth.

By putting E in the fourth, we are testing that specific position.

We can also consider other words like ""PRICE"" but C is not allowed.

""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E: but E is in the fifth position? We know E is not in the fifth because in the first guess, E was in the fifth and marked as wrong position. So if we put E in the fifth again, it would be incorrect. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in the fifth.

So ""DRIVE"" would put E in the fifth, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""BRINE"" -> but N is not allowed and E in fifth is not allowed.

So ""TRIED"" seems a good candidate.

But note: we are also allowed to use the letter E in the first position. For example, ""ERECT"" has E in first and then E again? But we don't know if E is repeated. Also, we have to avoid C.

""ERUPT"": E R U P T -> no C, A, N. And E is in the first position, which is not the fifth. This also tests U, P, T.

But we have two options: ""TRIED"" and ""ERUPT"". Which one is better?

We want to test as many new letters as possible. 

In ""TRIED"": new letters are T, I, E (we know E is present, but we are testing its position), D. So we test T, I, D.

In ""ERUPT"": new letters are E (known), R (known), U, P, T. So we test U, P, T.

But note: we already know R is in the second position, so we don't get new information about R. Similarly, E is known to be in the word, but we are testing its position.

In ""ERUPT"", we are putting E in the first position. If it turns out to be correct, we get a ✓, if not, we know E is not in the first.

Similarly, in ""TRIED"", we are putting E in the fourth position.

Both are valid. But let's see which one covers more common letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in a position we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

Another candidate: ""ROUSE"" -> R is in the first? But we need R in the second. So no.

""PRIME"" -> P R I M E: but E is in the fifth, which we know is wrong. So avoid.

""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: again, E in fifth.

So we must avoid E in the fifth.

Therefore, let's go with ""TRIED"".

But wait, we have another possibility: ""GREET"" -> G R E E T: but E is in the third and fourth? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, we are putting E in the third and fourth, but we know it's not in the fifth. However, we are repeating E, which might not be efficient.

So ""TRIED"" is better.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" is not common.

So I think ""TRIED"" is a good second guess.

But let's confirm: 
Guess: T R I E D

We are testing:
- T in first position
- R in second (already known, so we expect ✓)
- I in third position
- E in fourth position (we know E is in the word, but we are testing if it's in the fourth)
- D in fifth position

We will get feedback on T, I, E (position), and D.

If E is in the fourth, we get a ✓ for E? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a -.

But note: we know E is not in the fifth, but it could be in the first, third, or fourth.

By putting E in the fourth, we are testing that specific position.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first and I in the third.

So we are covering three new positions and one known position (R) and one new letter (D) in the fifth.

We are also testing D.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has E in the first position to test that, like ""ERUPT"". But ""ERUPT"" uses U and P which are less common than T, I, D? 

In terms of letter frequency, in English:
T, I, D are common; U and P are less common than T and I.

But we are not sure. 

Since we have limited information, either is acceptable.

But let's go with ""TRIED"" because it uses more common letters.

So our second guess is ""TRIED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (marked ""-"").

Key insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it's not in position 5).
- Avoid using C, A, or N in the new guess.

For the second guess, I chose ""tried"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ _ (R is in the second position).
- It includes E in the fourth position (testing a possible location for E).
- It uses new, common letters (T, I, D) to gather more information.
- It avoids C, A, and N.

This guess will help test:
- T in position 1
- I in position 3
- E in position 4
- D in position 5
- While confirming R in position 2.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tried""
- T: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [Note: This is the same E as before, but now we know it's not in position 4 either]
- D: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. Confirmed letters in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere, but not in position 4 or 5). Also, T is in the word but not in position 1.
3. Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I, D.

We also know that E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from the two guesses). Since the word is 5 letters, E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill (position 2 is fixed as R).

But we know E is in position 1 or 3. And T is in the word but not in 1, so T must be in 3, 4, or 5.

However, if E is in position 1, then T cannot be in 1 (which we know) and must be in 3,4,5. If E is in position 3, then T can be in 4 or 5.

But note: we have two unknowns: the position of E and T.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we know R and E, and T is also in the word, so at least three letters: R, E, T. But there might be more? Actually, we know the word has R, E, T, and two more letters.

Let's list the knowns:

- Position 2: R
- E is in the word: must be in position 1 or 3.
- T is in the word: must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

But note: if E is in position 3, then T cannot be in position 3 (because one letter per position). Similarly, if E is in position 1, then T can be in 3,4,5.

Also, we have two more letters to fill the remaining positions.

We also have eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, D. So we must avoid these.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes E (in position 1 or 3, to test which one) and T (in a position that is not 1, and not conflicting with E).
- Avoids C, A, N, I, D.

We want to test the positions of E and T and also discover the other letters.

Possible strategies:

Option 1: Assume E is in position 1 and T in position 3? But we don't know. We need to design a guess that can test multiple possibilities.

We can try to put E in position 1 and T in position 3? But then we have to fill the other positions.

But note: we don't know if E is in 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has E in 1 and T in 3, or E in 3 and T in 4, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use the known letters.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is: E R _ _ _

We know T is in the word and not in 1, so T must be in 3,4,5. Also, we have two more letters.

If E is in position 3, then the word is: _ R E _ _

And T must be in 4 or 5.

We can design a guess that covers both possibilities? For example, we can put E in position 1 and T in position 4? Then we can see the feedback.

Let's list possible words:

- If we put E in position 1: words like E R _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,A,N,I,D and include T in one of them.

For example: 
- ""ERUPT"" was considered earlier, but we now know I and D are not in the word, so ""ERUPT"" uses U, P, T. But we haven't tested U and P. However, in ""ERUPT"", T is in position 5.

But we also have the possibility that E is not in position 1. So if we guess ""ERUPT"", and if E is actually in position 3, then we might not get much information.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and T in position 4? For example, a word like _ R E T _

But we need a valid word. For instance, ""FRETS"" but S is not tested and we have 5 letters? ""FRETS"" is 5 letters: F R E T S.

But we don't know if F and S are in the word.

But we have to avoid C,A,N,I,D, so F and S are allowed.

However, we are not sure about the position of E and T.

Another idea: we can use a word that has E in position 1 and T in a different position, and also test other common letters.

But note: we have limited letters left to use. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,D (from the two guesses). So we can use other common letters like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Let's consider the feedback for E: we know E is not in 4 or 5, so only 1 or 3. We can test E in position 1 in this guess.

Similarly, for T, we know it's not in 1, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

To maximize information, we can put E in position 1 (to test if it's there) and T in a new position (say 5) and use common letters for the others.

For example: ""E R _ _ T""

What words? Like ""ERUPT"" (E R U P T) -> positions: E(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), T(5)

This tests:
- E in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, then E must be in position 3 (since we know it's in the word).
- T in position 5: if T is in the word, we can see if it's in 5 or not.

Also, we test U and P.

If we get E in position 1 correct, then we know the word starts with E R. If not, then we know E is in position 3.

Similarly, for T: if we get T in position 5 correct, then we know it's there. If not, but T is in the word (we know it is), then T must be in 3 or 4.

But note: in ""ERUPT"", position 3 is U and position 4 is P. If E is not in 1, then we don't get information about U and P? But we still get feedback on U and P.

Alternatively, we can put E in position 3 and T in position 4. For example, a word like ""P R E T Y"" but ""PRETY"" is not a word. ""PRETZ"" not a word. ""FRETS"" as I thought earlier: F R E T S.

""FRETS"" is a word.

So we have two main options: ""ERUPT"" and ""FRETS"".

Let's compare:

- ""ERUPT"": 
  - Tests E in position 1, T in position 5.
  - Uses U and P.

- ""FRETS"":
  - Tests E in position 3, T in position 4.
  - Uses F and S.

Which one is better? We don't know which letters are more likely. But we can consider letter frequency.

In English, S is very common at the end, and F is common. U and P are also common.

But note: we have position 5 open. In ""ERUPT"", we put T at the end, which might be common. In ""FRETS"", we put S at the end.

But we know T is in the word, so putting T at the end might be good if we think it's there.

But we don't have strong evidence.

Another factor: we want to resolve the position of E. If we guess ""ERUPT"" and E is not in position 1, then we know E must be in position 3. Similarly, if we guess ""FRETS"" and E is not in position 3, then E must be in position 1.

So both can resolve E's position.

But with ""ERUPT"", we also test T in position 5. If T is in position 5, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, we know T is in 3 or 4.

With ""FRETS"", we test T in position 4. If T is in 4, we get ✓; if not, then T is in 3 or 5.

But we have to consider that in ""FRETS"", if E is not in 3, then we know E is in 1, and T might be in 5.

I think both are reasonable.

But let's see if we can cover more possibilities.

We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third. We need to be efficient.

Another word: what about ""ROUSE""? But R is in position 1? We need R in position 2. So no.

""STREP"" -> S T R E P: but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So no.

We must have R in position 2.

So back to ""ERUPT"" and ""FRETS"".

I think I'll go with ""ERUPT"" because it tests E in position 1 and T in position 5, which are two critical positions we are unsure of.

So let's choose ""ERUPT"".

But note: in ""ERUPT"", we have E in 1 and T in 5. We know E might be in 1 or 3, and T might be in 3,4,5. If we put T in 5, and if T is actually in 3 or 4, we'll get a '-' for T, which is still informative.

Similarly, if E is in 3, we'll get a '-' for E in position 1.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, third guess: ""ERUPT""

But let's write it: E R U P T

Now, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,A,N,I,D. ""ERUPT"" has E,R,U,P,T. None of the forbidden letters, so it's valid.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (in word but wrong position). This reveals:
  - R is the second letter (position 2).
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""tried"")**: T (in word but wrong position), R (correct position), I (not in word), E (in word but wrong position), D (not in word). This adds:
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.
  - E is not in position 4 (since it was marked wrong there, and we already knew it wasn't in position 5).
  - I and D are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The word pattern is: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in position 2).
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R (position 2), E, and T.
  - E must be in position 1 or 3 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
  - T must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, D (cannot appear in any guess).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 3, 4, and 5 (with E and T occupying two of these, plus two unknown letters).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of E (position 1 or 3) and T (position 3, 4, or 5) while covering new common letters.
- Use a word that:
  - Has R in position 2.
  - Includes E and T (to verify their positions).
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, I, D).
  - Introduces new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, L, O, U, P) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ""ERUPT""** (E R U P T):
  - Puts E in position 1 (to test if it belongs there).
  - Puts T in position 5 (to test if it belongs at the end).
  - Uses U and P (common letters not yet tested).
  - Fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` and avoids eliminated letters.

This guess will help:
- Confirm or rule out E in position 1 (if E is correct, it gets ✓; if not, E must be in position 3).
- Confirm or rule out T in position 5 (if T is correct, it gets ✓; if not, T must be in position 3 or 4).
- Test U and P for presence and position.

- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [Note: This is the same E as before, but now we know it's not in position 4 either]
- D: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. Confirmed letters in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere, but not in position 4 or 5). Also, T is in the word but not in position 1.
3. Letters not in the word: C, A, N, I, D.

We also know that E is in the word but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from the two guesses). Since the word is 5 letters, E must be in position 1 or 3.

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 to fill (position 2 is fixed as R).

But we know E is in position 1 or 3. And T is in the word but not in 1, so T must be in 3, 4, or 5.

However, if E is in position 1, then T cannot be in 1 (which we know) and must be in 3,4,5. If E is in position 3, then T can be in 4 or 5.

But note: we have two unknowns: the position of E and T.

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word has 5 letters, and we know R and E, and T is also in the word, so at least three letters: R, E, T. But there might be more? Actually, we know the word has R, E, T, and two more letters.

Let's list the knowns:

- Position 2: R
- E is in the word: must be in position 1 or 3.
- T is in the word: must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

But note: if E is in position 3, then T cannot be in position 3 (because one letter per position). Similarly, if E is in position 1, then T can be in 3,4,5.

Also, we have two more letters to fill the remaining positions.

We also have eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, D. So we must avoid these.

Now, we need to make a third guess that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes E (in position 1 or 3, to test which one) and T (in a position that is not 1, and not conflicting with E).
- Avoids C, A, N, I, D.

We want to test the positions of E and T and also discover the other letters.

Possible strategies:

Option 1: Assume E is in position 1 and T in position 3? But we don't know. We need to design a guess that can test multiple possibilities.

We can try to put E in position 1 and T in position 3? But then we have to fill the other positions.

But note: we don't know if E is in 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has E in 1 and T in 3, or E in 3 and T in 4, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use the known letters.

First, if E is in position 1, then the word is: E R _ _ _

We know T is in the word and not in 1, so T must be in 3,4,5. Also, we have two more letters.

If E is in position 3, then the word is: _ R E _ _

And T must be in 4 or 5.

We can design a guess that covers both possibilities? For example, we can put E in position 1 and T in position 4? Then we can see the feedback.

Let's list possible words:

- If we put E in position 1: words like E R _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,A,N,I,D and include T in one of them.

For example: 
- ""ERUPT"" was considered earlier, but we now know I and D are not in the word, so ""ERUPT"" uses U, P, T. But we haven't tested U and P. However, in ""ERUPT"", T is in position 5.

But we also have the possibility that E is not in position 1. So if we guess ""ERUPT"", and if E is actually in position 3, then we might not get much information.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and T in position 4? For example, a word like _ R E T _

But we need a valid word. For instance, ""FRETS"" but S is not tested and we have 5 letters? ""FRETS"" is 5 letters: F R E T S.

But we don't know if F and S are in the word.

But we have to avoid C,A,N,I,D, so F and S are allowed.

However, we are not sure about the position of E and T.

Another idea: we can use a word that has E in position 1 and T in a different position, and also test other common letters.

But note: we have limited letters left to use. We have used: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,D (from the two guesses). So we can use other common letters like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc.

Let's consider the feedback for E: we know E is not in 4 or 5, so only 1 or 3. We can test E in position 1 in this guess.

Similarly, for T, we know it's not in 1, so we can put it in 3,4, or 5.

To maximize information, we can put E in position 1 (to test if it's there) and T in a new position (say 5) and use common letters for the others.

For example: ""E R _ _ T""

What words? Like ""ERUPT"" (E R U P T) -> positions: E(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), T(5)

This tests:
- E in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, then E must be in position 3 (since we know it's in the word).
- T in position 5: if T is in the word, we can see if it's in 5 or not.

Also, we test U and P.

If we get E in position 1 correct, then we know the word starts with E R. If not, then we know E is in position 3.

Similarly, for T: if we get T in position 5 correct, then we know it's there. If not, but T is in the word (we know it is), then T must be in 3 or 4.

But note: in ""ERUPT"", position 3 is U and position 4 is P. If E is not in 1, then we don't get information about U and P? But we still get feedback on U and P.

Alternatively, we can put E in position 3 and T in position 4. For example, a word like ""P R E T Y"" but ""PRETY"" is not a word. ""PRETZ"" not a word. ""FRETS"" as I thought earlier: F R E T S.

""FRETS"" is a word.

So we have two main options: ""ERUPT"" and ""FRETS"".

Let's compare:

- ""ERUPT"": 
  - Tests E in position 1, T in position 5.
  - Uses U and P.

- ""FRETS"":
  - Tests E in position 3, T in position 4.
  - Uses F and S.

Which one is better? We don't know which letters are more likely. But we can consider letter frequency.

In English, S is very common at the end, and F is common. U and P are also common.

But note: we have position 5 open. In ""ERUPT"", we put T at the end, which might be common. In ""FRETS"", we put S at the end.

But we know T is in the word, so putting T at the end might be good if we think it's there.

But we don't have strong evidence.

Another factor: we want to resolve the position of E. If we guess ""ERUPT"" and E is not in position 1, then we know E must be in position 3. Similarly, if we guess ""FRETS"" and E is not in position 3, then E must be in position 1.

So both can resolve E's position.

But with ""ERUPT"", we also test T in position 5. If T is in position 5, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, we know T is in 3 or 4.

With ""FRETS"", we test T in position 4. If T is in 4, we get ✓; if not, then T is in 3 or 5.

But we have to consider that in ""FRETS"", if E is not in 3, then we know E is in 1, and T might be in 5.

I think both are reasonable.

But let's see if we can cover more possibilities.

We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third. We need to be efficient.

Another word: what about ""ROUSE""? But R is in position 1? We need R in position 2. So no.

""STREP"" -> S T R E P: but R is in position 3? We need R in position 2. So no.

We must have R in position 2.

So back to ""ERUPT"" and ""FRETS"".

I think I'll go with ""ERUPT"" because it tests E in position 1 and T in position 5, which are two critical positions we are unsure of.

So let's choose ""ERUPT"".

But note: in ""ERUPT"", we have E in 1 and T in 5. We know E might be in 1 or 3, and T might be in 3,4,5. If we put T in 5, and if T is actually in 3 or 4, we'll get a '-' for T, which is still informative.

Similarly, if E is in 3, we'll get a '-' for E in position 1.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, third guess: ""ERUPT""

But let's write it: E R U P T

Now, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C,A,N,I,D. ""ERUPT"" has E,R,U,P,T. None of the forbidden letters, so it's valid.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (in word but wrong position). This reveals:
  - R is the second letter (position 2).
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""tried"")**: T (in word but wrong position), R (correct position), I (not in word), E (in word but wrong position), D (not in word). This adds:
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.
  - E is not in position 4 (since it was marked wrong there, and we already knew it wasn't in position 5).
  - I and D are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The word pattern is: `_ R _ _ _` (R is fixed in position 2).
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: R (position 2), E, and T.
  - E must be in position 1 or 3 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
  - T must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, D (cannot appear in any guess).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 3, 4, and 5 (with E and T occupying two of these, plus two unknown letters).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of E (position 1 or 3) and T (position 3, 4, or 5) while covering new common letters.
- Use a word that:
  - Has R in position 2.
  - Includes E and T (to verify their positions).
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, A, N, I, D).
  - Introduces new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, L, O, U, P) to gather more information.
- **Chosen word: ""ERUPT""** (E R U P T):
  - Puts E in position 1 (to test if it belongs there).
  - Puts T in position 5 (to test if it belongs at the end).
  - Uses U and P (common letters not yet tested).
  - Fits the pattern `_ R _ _ _` and avoids eliminated letters.

This guess will help:
- Confirm or rule out E in position 1 (if E is correct, it gets ✓; if not, E must be in position 3).
- Confirm or rule out T in position 5 (if T is correct, it gets ✓; if not, T must be in position 3 or 4).
- Test U and P for presence and position.",Guess 3: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) R(✓) U(✓) P(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
