We are starting the game. We have no information yet. It's the first guess.
 To maximize the information gained, we should choose a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let's pick one that uses common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"":
 - C, R, A, N, E are all common letters.

 This will give us good information about which letters are present and their positions.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 From this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter word.
 2. Must include the letter E (because we know it's in the word) and avoid using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. We have to choose letters that are still possible. Since we know E is somewhere in the word, we can try to put E in different positions.

 Also, we can use other common letters that haven't been ruled out. The absence of C, R, A, N means we have to choose from the remaining letters.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering the English language, we might want a word that has E and other common consonants and vowels.

 We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so we can try placing E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that we have very limited information. Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - We could try words starting with E? But note we don't know if E is at the start or not. Alternatively, we might try words where E is in the middle.

 Since we only know one letter (E) and it can be in many positions, we might also try to get more information about other vowels and common consonants.

 The word must contain E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's brainstorm some words:

 - Words ending with E are common, but we know E isn't at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it can't be the last letter. So words ending with E are not allowed? Actually, no: we can still use words that have E in other positions? Actually, it doesn't matter because we're not forced to have E at the end. But note our guess must be a valid word, and it can have E anywhere except the 5th? Actually, no: the secret word has E somewhere (but not at position 5). Our next guess can have E in any position because we don't know where it is in the secret word. However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - ""TABLE"": but has A? A is ruled out -> no, A is not allowed because it was marked absent. Similarly, ""STALE"" has A and E but A is not allowed.

 Let's think of words without A, C, R, N and including E.

 Some ideas: 
 - ""FIGHT"": no E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, we know the secret word has E, but our next guess doesn't have to include E? 
   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about other letters. But note: we are allowed to guess words without E, but that wouldn't help us confirm the E position. Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.

 So, we want a word that:
   includes E (to gain more positional info),
   avoids C, R, A, N,
   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.

 Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.

 Words without C, R, A, N: 
   Possible words: 
     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That's position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be '-' if the secret word has E in a different position? 

 Actually, note: 
   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. 
   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: 
        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be '-' (because it's in the secret but not at position 5).
        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don't know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.

 So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get '-' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word's E isn't at 5). But note: we don't know if there might be two E's? The word might have more than one E? But we haven't ruled that out.

 However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.

 Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it's correct.

 Let's consider: 
   Position 1: E
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: E

 We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.

 Example words: 
   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.
   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? 
      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? 
      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? 
      However, note: the secret word might not have two E's. But we don't know.

 But let's consider the letters: 
   E is known to be present (at least one). 
   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.

 Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? 
   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked '-' if the secret word has E elsewhere.

 However, if we put E at a position we haven't tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it's correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn't at 5 in the secret. 

 But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won't test a new position.

 Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.

 So, let's try to avoid putting E in position 5.

 Also, we want to test new letters: 
   What letters haven't been tried? 
   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we've tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.

 So, let me try to form a word that:
   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4
   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Words:

   Position 1: E
      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.
      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E's, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. 

   How about: 
      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don't know if E is the first letter. This is valid.

   Position 2: E
      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> 
      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.
      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.

   Position 3: E
      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? 
      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. 
      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.

      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? 
        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? 
        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.

   Position 4: E
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.

 So we have a few options: 
   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.
   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.
   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.

 But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.

 How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried? 
   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.

 Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?

 We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.

 Since we only know E is in the word, and we don't know about other vowels? We haven't tested O, I, U? 

 Let me check: 
   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven't tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U? And E is present? 

 The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don't know? 

 So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? 

 In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? 

 How about a word with O and E? 

 Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? 

 But O is a vowel we haven't tested? That's good? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That's fine? 

 Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it's okay.

 But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven't used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.

 But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.

 However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.

 So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.

 After considering, let's think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? 

 But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".

 Now, which word to pick? 

 Criteria: 
   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? 
   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? 
   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? 

 ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? 
 ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? 
 ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? 
 ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? 

 All distinct? 

 Let me compare: 
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it's green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don't know? But if it's amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? 

   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? 

   Since we don't know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? 

   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? 

   Which word tests more common letters? 

   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? 
   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? 
   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 

   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? 

   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don't know? 

   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? 

   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? 

   Also, S is the last letter? We haven't tested S? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don't test E? 

   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? 

   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? 

   Let me see: 
      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? 

   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don't know? But our guesses don't have duplicates? 

   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn't get any green? 

   Alternatively, let's try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven't eliminated? And also test many common letters? 

   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? 

   Words with E at position 2: 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? 
      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? 

   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? 

   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? 

   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? 

   Comparing:
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? 

   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? 

   Now, which gives more information? 
      For E: 
        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? 
        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? 
      But we don't know? Either way we narrow down? 

   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? 

   Since the first word ""crane"" didn't give any hits in any position? We have no information? 

   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? 

   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the frequency. 

   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? 
      Actually, E can be at many positions? 

   We can also consider word lists? But we don't have them.

   Given that, I'll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? 

   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? 

   After reconsidering: 
      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? 
      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? 

   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? 

   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? 

   Actually, we might get green? We don't know? 

   So, I think either is fine? 

   But note: we are also testing other letters? 

   The letter T: We haven't tested T? It's common? So let's test T? 

   Also, S is common so we might test S? 

   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? 

   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

   T is tested in both? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? 

   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? 

   Actually, we haven't tested B, L, U, S? 

   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? 

   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? 

   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? 

   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? 

   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? 

   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? 

   Therefore, I'll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? 

   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that's not an option? 

   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? 

   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don't know? 

   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? 

   This tests S, L, E, P, T? 

   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? 

   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? 

   But note: we haven't tried P and L? 

   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? 

   Making a decision: 
      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y
      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S
      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T

   Let me compare the letters: 
      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? 
      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S
      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? 

   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? 

   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? 

   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? 

   And we do not use any forbidden letter? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   This word seems very efficient? 

   How common are the letters? 
      T: very common? 
      E: known to be in? 
      S: very common? 
      L: common? 
      P: common? 

   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? 

   Final choice: ""SLEPT""

   But note: we haven't tried S, L, P, T? 

   So this tests five new letters? And E? 

   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? 

   Yes? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""SLEPT"".

   Steps: 
     SLEPT: 
        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)

   We hope for greens? 

   So: <guess>slept</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:
- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)
- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)
- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations
- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information

The word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)
- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities

<guess>slept</guess>",slept,"We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 From this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter word.
 2. Must include the letter E (because we know it's in the word) and avoid using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. We have to choose letters that are still possible. Since we know E is somewhere in the word, we can try to put E in different positions.

 Also, we can use other common letters that haven't been ruled out. The absence of C, R, A, N means we have to choose from the remaining letters.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering the English language, we might want a word that has E and other common consonants and vowels.

 We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so we can try placing E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that we have very limited information. Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - We could try words starting with E? But note we don't know if E is at the start or not. Alternatively, we might try words where E is in the middle.

 Since we only know one letter (E) and it can be in many positions, we might also try to get more information about other vowels and common consonants.

 The word must contain E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's brainstorm some words:

 - Words ending with E are common, but we know E isn't at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it can't be the last letter. So words ending with E are not allowed? Actually, no: we can still use words that have E in other positions? Actually, it doesn't matter because we're not forced to have E at the end. But note our guess must be a valid word, and it can have E anywhere except the 5th? Actually, no: the secret word has E somewhere (but not at position 5). Our next guess can have E in any position because we don't know where it is in the secret word. However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - ""TABLE"": but has A? A is ruled out -> no, A is not allowed because it was marked absent. Similarly, ""STALE"" has A and E but A is not allowed.

 Let's think of words without A, C, R, N and including E.

 Some ideas: 
 - ""FIGHT"": no E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, we know the secret word has E, but our next guess doesn't have to include E? 
   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about other letters. But note: we are allowed to guess words without E, but that wouldn't help us confirm the E position. Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.

 So, we want a word that:
   includes E (to gain more positional info),
   avoids C, R, A, N,
   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.

 Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.

 Words without C, R, A, N: 
   Possible words: 
     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That's position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be '-' if the secret word has E in a different position? 

 Actually, note: 
   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. 
   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: 
        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be '-' (because it's in the secret but not at position 5).
        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don't know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.

 So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get '-' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word's E isn't at 5). But note: we don't know if there might be two E's? The word might have more than one E? But we haven't ruled that out.

 However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.

 Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it's correct.

 Let's consider: 
   Position 1: E
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: E

 We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.

 Example words: 
   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.
   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? 
      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? 
      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? 
      However, note: the secret word might not have two E's. But we don't know.

 But let's consider the letters: 
   E is known to be present (at least one). 
   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.

 Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? 
   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked '-' if the secret word has E elsewhere.

 However, if we put E at a position we haven't tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it's correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn't at 5 in the secret. 

 But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won't test a new position.

 Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.

 So, let's try to avoid putting E in position 5.

 Also, we want to test new letters: 
   What letters haven't been tried? 
   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we've tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.

 So, let me try to form a word that:
   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4
   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Words:

   Position 1: E
      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.
      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E's, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. 

   How about: 
      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don't know if E is the first letter. This is valid.

   Position 2: E
      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> 
      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.
      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.

   Position 3: E
      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? 
      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. 
      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.

      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? 
        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? 
        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.

   Position 4: E
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.

 So we have a few options: 
   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.
   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.
   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.

 But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.

 How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried? 
   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.

 Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?

 We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.

 Since we only know E is in the word, and we don't know about other vowels? We haven't tested O, I, U? 

 Let me check: 
   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven't tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U? And E is present? 

 The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don't know? 

 So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? 

 In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? 

 How about a word with O and E? 

 Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? 

 But O is a vowel we haven't tested? That's good? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That's fine? 

 Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it's okay.

 But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven't used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.

 But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.

 However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.

 So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.

 After considering, let's think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? 

 But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".

 Now, which word to pick? 

 Criteria: 
   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? 
   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? 
   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? 

 ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? 
 ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? 
 ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? 
 ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? 

 All distinct? 

 Let me compare: 
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it's green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don't know? But if it's amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? 

   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? 

   Since we don't know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? 

   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? 

   Which word tests more common letters? 

   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? 
   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? 
   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 

   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? 

   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don't know? 

   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? 

   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? 

   Also, S is the last letter? We haven't tested S? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don't test E? 

   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? 

   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? 

   Let me see: 
      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? 

   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don't know? But our guesses don't have duplicates? 

   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn't get any green? 

   Alternatively, let's try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven't eliminated? And also test many common letters? 

   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? 

   Words with E at position 2: 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? 
      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? 

   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? 

   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? 

   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? 

   Comparing:
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? 

   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? 

   Now, which gives more information? 
      For E: 
        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? 
        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? 
      But we don't know? Either way we narrow down? 

   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? 

   Since the first word ""crane"" didn't give any hits in any position? We have no information? 

   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? 

   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the frequency. 

   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? 
      Actually, E can be at many positions? 

   We can also consider word lists? But we don't have them.

   Given that, I'll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? 

   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? 

   After reconsidering: 
      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? 
      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? 

   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? 

   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? 

   Actually, we might get green? We don't know? 

   So, I think either is fine? 

   But note: we are also testing other letters? 

   The letter T: We haven't tested T? It's common? So let's test T? 

   Also, S is common so we might test S? 

   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? 

   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

   T is tested in both? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? 

   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? 

   Actually, we haven't tested B, L, U, S? 

   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? 

   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? 

   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? 

   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? 

   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? 

   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? 

   Therefore, I'll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? 

   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that's not an option? 

   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? 

   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don't know? 

   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? 

   This tests S, L, E, P, T? 

   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? 

   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? 

   But note: we haven't tried P and L? 

   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? 

   Making a decision: 
      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y
      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S
      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T

   Let me compare the letters: 
      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? 
      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S
      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? 

   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? 

   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? 

   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? 

   And we do not use any forbidden letter? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   This word seems very efficient? 

   How common are the letters? 
      T: very common? 
      E: known to be in? 
      S: very common? 
      L: common? 
      P: common? 

   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? 

   Final choice: ""SLEPT""

   But note: we haven't tried S, L, P, T? 

   So this tests five new letters? And E? 

   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? 

   Yes? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""SLEPT"".

   Steps: 
     SLEPT: 
        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)

   We hope for greens? 

   So: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:
- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)
- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)
- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations
- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information

The word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)
- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities",Guess 2: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) E(-) P(x) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,HEFTY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet. It's the first guess.
 To maximize the information gained, we should choose a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let's pick one that uses common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"":
 - C, R, A, N, E are all common letters.

 This will give us good information about which letters are present and their positions.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 From this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter word.
 2. Must include the letter E (because we know it's in the word) and avoid using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. We have to choose letters that are still possible. Since we know E is somewhere in the word, we can try to put E in different positions.

 Also, we can use other common letters that haven't been ruled out. The absence of C, R, A, N means we have to choose from the remaining letters.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering the English language, we might want a word that has E and other common consonants and vowels.

 We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so we can try placing E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that we have very limited information. Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - We could try words starting with E? But note we don't know if E is at the start or not. Alternatively, we might try words where E is in the middle.

 Since we only know one letter (E) and it can be in many positions, we might also try to get more information about other vowels and common consonants.

 The word must contain E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's brainstorm some words:

 - Words ending with E are common, but we know E isn't at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it can't be the last letter. So words ending with E are not allowed? Actually, no: we can still use words that have E in other positions? Actually, it doesn't matter because we're not forced to have E at the end. But note our guess must be a valid word, and it can have E anywhere except the 5th? Actually, no: the secret word has E somewhere (but not at position 5). Our next guess can have E in any position because we don't know where it is in the secret word. However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - ""TABLE"": but has A? A is ruled out -> no, A is not allowed because it was marked absent. Similarly, ""STALE"" has A and E but A is not allowed.

 Let's think of words without A, C, R, N and including E.

 Some ideas: 
 - ""FIGHT"": no E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, we know the secret word has E, but our next guess doesn't have to include E? 
   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about other letters. But note: we are allowed to guess words without E, but that wouldn't help us confirm the E position. Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.

 So, we want a word that:
   includes E (to gain more positional info),
   avoids C, R, A, N,
   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.

 Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.

 Words without C, R, A, N: 
   Possible words: 
     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That's position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be '-' if the secret word has E in a different position? 

 Actually, note: 
   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. 
   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: 
        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be '-' (because it's in the secret but not at position 5).
        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don't know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.

 So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get '-' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word's E isn't at 5). But note: we don't know if there might be two E's? The word might have more than one E? But we haven't ruled that out.

 However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.

 Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it's correct.

 Let's consider: 
   Position 1: E
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: E

 We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.

 Example words: 
   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.
   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? 
      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? 
      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? 
      However, note: the secret word might not have two E's. But we don't know.

 But let's consider the letters: 
   E is known to be present (at least one). 
   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.

 Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? 
   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked '-' if the secret word has E elsewhere.

 However, if we put E at a position we haven't tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it's correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn't at 5 in the secret. 

 But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won't test a new position.

 Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.

 So, let's try to avoid putting E in position 5.

 Also, we want to test new letters: 
   What letters haven't been tried? 
   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we've tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.

 So, let me try to form a word that:
   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4
   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Words:

   Position 1: E
      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.
      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E's, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. 

   How about: 
      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don't know if E is the first letter. This is valid.

   Position 2: E
      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> 
      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.
      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.

   Position 3: E
      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? 
      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. 
      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.

      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? 
        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? 
        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.

   Position 4: E
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.

 So we have a few options: 
   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.
   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.
   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.

 But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.

 How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried? 
   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.

 Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?

 We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.

 Since we only know E is in the word, and we don't know about other vowels? We haven't tested O, I, U? 

 Let me check: 
   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven't tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U? And E is present? 

 The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don't know? 

 So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? 

 In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? 

 How about a word with O and E? 

 Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? 

 But O is a vowel we haven't tested? That's good? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That's fine? 

 Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it's okay.

 But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven't used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.

 But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.

 However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.

 So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.

 After considering, let's think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? 

 But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".

 Now, which word to pick? 

 Criteria: 
   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? 
   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? 
   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? 

 ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? 
 ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? 
 ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? 
 ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? 

 All distinct? 

 Let me compare: 
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it's green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don't know? But if it's amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? 

   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? 

   Since we don't know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? 

   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? 

   Which word tests more common letters? 

   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? 
   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? 
   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 

   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? 

   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don't know? 

   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? 

   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? 

   Also, S is the last letter? We haven't tested S? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don't test E? 

   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? 

   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? 

   Let me see: 
      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? 

   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don't know? But our guesses don't have duplicates? 

   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn't get any green? 

   Alternatively, let's try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven't eliminated? And also test many common letters? 

   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? 

   Words with E at position 2: 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? 
      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? 

   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? 

   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? 

   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? 

   Comparing:
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? 

   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? 

   Now, which gives more information? 
      For E: 
        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? 
        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? 
      But we don't know? Either way we narrow down? 

   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? 

   Since the first word ""crane"" didn't give any hits in any position? We have no information? 

   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? 

   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the frequency. 

   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? 
      Actually, E can be at many positions? 

   We can also consider word lists? But we don't have them.

   Given that, I'll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? 

   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? 

   After reconsidering: 
      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? 
      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? 

   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? 

   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? 

   Actually, we might get green? We don't know? 

   So, I think either is fine? 

   But note: we are also testing other letters? 

   The letter T: We haven't tested T? It's common? So let's test T? 

   Also, S is common so we might test S? 

   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? 

   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

   T is tested in both? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? 

   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? 

   Actually, we haven't tested B, L, U, S? 

   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? 

   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? 

   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? 

   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? 

   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? 

   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? 

   Therefore, I'll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? 

   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that's not an option? 

   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? 

   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don't know? 

   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? 

   This tests S, L, E, P, T? 

   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? 

   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? 

   But note: we haven't tried P and L? 

   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? 

   Making a decision: 
      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y
      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S
      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T

   Let me compare the letters: 
      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? 
      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S
      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? 

   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? 

   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? 

   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? 

   And we do not use any forbidden letter? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   This word seems very efficient? 

   How common are the letters? 
      T: very common? 
      E: known to be in? 
      S: very common? 
      L: common? 
      P: common? 

   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? 

   Final choice: ""SLEPT""

   But note: we haven't tried S, L, P, T? 

   So this tests five new letters? And E? 

   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? 

   Yes? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""SLEPT"".

   Steps: 
     SLEPT: 
        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)

   We hope for greens? 

   So: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:
- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)
- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)
- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations
- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information

The word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)
- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities

Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.\n\n So, we want a word that:\n   includes E (to gain more positional info),\n   avoids C, R, A, N,\n   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.\n\n Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n Words without C, R, A, N: \n   Possible words: \n     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That\'s position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be \'-\' if the secret word has E in a different position? \n\n Actually, note: \n   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. \n   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: \n        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be \'-\' (because it\'s in the secret but not at position 5).\n        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don\'t know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.\n\n So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get \'-\' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word\'s E isn\'t at 5). But note: we don\'t know if there might be two E\'s? The word might have more than one E? But we haven\'t ruled that out.\n\n However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it\'s correct.\n\n Let\'s consider: \n   Position 1: E\n   Position 2: E\n   Position 3: E\n   Position 4: E\n\n We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.\n\n Example words: \n   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.\n   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? \n      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? \n      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? \n      However, note: the secret word might not have two E\'s. But we don\'t know.\n\n But let\'s consider the letters: \n   E is known to be present (at least one). \n   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.\n\n Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? \n   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked \'-\' if the secret word has E elsewhere.\n\n However, if we put E at a position we haven\'t tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it\'s correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn\'t at 5 in the secret. \n\n But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won\'t test a new position.\n\n Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n So, let\'s try to avoid putting E in position 5.\n\n Also, we want to test new letters: \n   What letters haven\'t been tried? \n   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we\'ve tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.\n\n So, let me try to form a word that:\n   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4\n   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n Words:\n\n   Position 1: E\n      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.\n      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E\'s, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. \n\n   How about: \n      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don\'t know if E is the first letter. This is valid.\n\n   Position 2: E\n      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> \n      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.\n      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.\n\n   Position 3: E\n      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? \n      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. \n      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.\n\n      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? \n        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? \n        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.\n\n   Position 4: E\n      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.\n\n So we have a few options: \n   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.\n   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.\n   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.\n\n But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.\n\n How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.\n\n Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.\n\n Since we only know E is in the word, and we don\'t know about other vowels? We haven\'t tested O, I, U? \n\n Let me check: \n   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven\'t tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven\'t tested are I, O, U? And E is present? \n\n The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don\'t know? \n\n So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? \n\n In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? \n\n How about a word with O and E? \n\n Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? \n\n But O is a vowel we haven\'t tested? That\'s good? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That\'s fine? \n\n Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven\'t used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.\n\n But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.\n\n However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.\n\n So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? \n\n Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.\n\n After considering, let\'s think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? \n\n But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".\n\n Now, which word to pick? \n\n Criteria: \n   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? \n   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? \n   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? \n\n ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? \n ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? \n ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? \n ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? \n\n All distinct? \n\n Let me compare: \n   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it\'s green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don\'t know? But if it\'s amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? \n\n   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? \n\n   Since we don\'t know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? \n\n   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? \n\n   Which word tests more common letters? \n\n   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? \n   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? \n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? \n   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? \n\n   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? \n\n   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don\'t know? \n\n   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? \n\n   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? \n\n   Also, S is the last letter? We haven\'t tested S? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don\'t test E? \n\n   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? \n\n   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? \n\n   Let me see: \n      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? \n\n   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But our guesses don\'t have duplicates? \n\n   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? \n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn\'t get any green? \n\n   Alternatively, let\'s try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven\'t eliminated? And also test many common letters? \n\n   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? \n\n   Words with E at position 2: \n      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? \n      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.\n\n   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? \n\n   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? \n\n   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? \n\n   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? \n\n   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? \n\n   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? \n\n   Comparing:\n      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? \n      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? \n\n   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? \n\n   Now, which gives more information? \n      For E: \n        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? \n        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? \n      But we don\'t know? Either way we narrow down? \n\n   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? \n\n   Since the first word ""crane"" didn\'t give any hits in any position? We have no information? \n\n   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? \n\n   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? \n\n   Alternatively, let\'s consider the frequency. \n\n   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? \n      Actually, E can be at many positions? \n\n   We can also consider word lists? But we don\'t have them.\n\n   Given that, I\'ll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? \n\n   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? \n\n   After reconsidering: \n      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? \n      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? \n\n   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? \n\n   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? \n\n   Actually, we might get green? We don\'t know? \n\n   So, I think either is fine? \n\n   But note: we are also testing other letters? \n\n   The letter T: We haven\'t tested T? It\'s common? So let\'s test T? \n\n   Also, S is common so we might test S? \n\n   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? \n\n   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? \n\n   T is tested in both? \n\n   We can choose one? \n\n   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? \n\n   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? \n\n   Actually, we haven\'t tested B, L, U, S? \n\n   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? \n\n   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? \n\n   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? \n\n   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? \n\n   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? \n\n   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? \n\n   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that\'s not an option? \n\n   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? \n\n   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don\'t know? \n\n   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? \n\n   This tests S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? \n\n   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried P and L? \n\n   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? \n\n   Making a decision: \n      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y\n      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S\n      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T\n\n   Let me compare the letters: \n      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? \n      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S\n      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? \n\n   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? \n\n   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   And we do not use any forbidden letter? \n\n   Also, E at position 3? \n\n   This word seems very efficient? \n\n   How common are the letters? \n      T: very common? \n      E: known to be in? \n      S: very common? \n      L: common? \n      P: common? \n\n   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? \n\n   Final choice: ""SLEPT""\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried S, L, P, T? \n\n   So this tests five new letters? And E? \n\n   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? \n\n   Yes? \n\n   Therefore, let\'s guess ""SLEPT"".\n\n   Steps: \n     SLEPT: \n        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)\n\n   We hope for greens? \n\n   So: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:\n- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)\n- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)\n- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations\n- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information\n\nThe word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)\n- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities\n\n<guess>slept</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) E(-) P(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""slept"" -> S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)
Meaning: S, L, P are absent. E is present but not in position 3 (since we put it at position 3 and got '-'). T is present but not in position 5 (because we put T at position 5 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
Present letters: E (but not at position 3 or 5), T (but not at position 5)

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, T is present but not at position 5, so T must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Must include E and T (since they are present)
- Must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
- We should try to position E in one of the possible positions (1,2,4) and T in one of the possible positions (1,2,3,4) to get more information.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 7 absent (C,R,A,N,S,L,P) and minus the 2 present (E,T) that we know? But note: we don't know if there are more letters? We have to use only the remaining letters.

Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, P -> 7 letters.
Present: E, T -> 2 letters.

But the word has 5 letters, so we need 3 more letters that are not absent and not E or T? But E and T are already present, so they can be used again? However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can use E and T again? But we are not forced to? Actually, we must include E and T at least once? But we can include them multiple times? But that might not be efficient? 

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters? However, since we are trying to get information, it's better to use distinct letters? 

So, we have 26 - 7 = 19 letters available? But we have already used E and T? But they are available to use? The absent letters are the ones we cannot use. So available letters: all letters except C,R,A,N,S,L,P. That is: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and also E and T? 

But E and T are present? So we can use them? 

So the available set: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word that has E and T? And we have to use three more letters from the above? 

We also have constraints on the positions of E and T.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,4 (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We can try to put E and T in positions that we haven't tried? 

For example, we haven't tried E at position 1 or 2 or 4? And T at position 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we have tried T at position 5? And we know it's not at 5? 

We haven't tried T at positions 1,2,3,4? 

Similarly, we tried E at position 3 and 5? So we haven't tried 1,2,4? 

We can try to put E at position 1 and T at position 2? Or E at 2 and T at 1? Etc.

But we also need to choose the other letters? 

We want to maximize information? So we should choose common letters that we haven't tried? 

Common letters from the available set: 
   Vowels: I, O, U? (we haven't tested any of these? We tested A and E? A is absent, E is present? So we need to test I, O, U? 
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, etc.

We can try to include a vowel? 

Let me try to form words that have E and T and one of I, O, U? 

Also, we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Option: E at position 1? 
   Then the word starts with E? 
   Then we need T in one of 2,3,4? 
   Example: 
        E _ _ _ _ 
        We can put T at position 2: E T _ _ _ 
        Then we need three more letters? 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> but H is available? But C is absent? Cannot use C? 
        ""ETHYL"": E, T, H, Y, L -> but L is absent? Cannot use L? 
        ""ETUDE"": E, T, U, D, E -> has E twice? And U? 
            But E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? Because the secret word doesn't have E at 5? 
            So we must avoid putting E at 5? 
            Therefore, ""ETUDE"" is invalid because it has E at 5? 
        ""ETUIS"": E, T, U, I, S -> but S is absent? 
        ""ETWAS"": not a word? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EATEN"" -> A and N absent? 
        ""EJECT"" -> C and J? C absent? 
        ""EMPTY"" -> M, P, T, Y? But P is absent? 
        ""ENTER"" -> E, N, T, E, R -> N and R absent? 
        ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> T at position 5? But we are putting T at 3? 
            Actually, ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> T at 5? But we want T at 3? 
        How about ""EIGHT"" doesn't fit? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 4? 
        E _ _ T _ 
        Words: ""EJECT"" -> C absent? 
        ""EXIST"" -> X, I, S, T -> S absent? 
        ""ELATE"" -> L and A absent? 
        ""EVENT"" -> V, E, N, T -> N absent? 

   This is difficult? 

Option: E at position 2? 
   Then: _ E _ _ _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T E _ _ _ 
        Words: ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> double E and double T? 
        ""TEACH"" -> A and C absent? 
        ""TEASE"" -> A and S absent? 
        ""TEMPT"" -> M, P, T -> P absent? 
        ""TENET"" -> N absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? 
        ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> P absent? 

   How about T at position 3: _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""METRO"" -> M, E, T, R, O -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> V, E, T, C, H -> C absent? 

   How about T at position 4: _ E _ T _ 
        Words: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> we already considered? But D is available? 
            But we haven't tried D? 
            ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is at position 4? 
            However, we know T is present and not at position 5? But we don't know about position 4? 
            Also, E is at position 2? 
            This word uses D, I, Y? 
            And avoids absent letters? 
            So ""DEITY"" is a valid word? 

        But wait: in the second guess, we tried ""slept"" and got T(-) at position 5? So T is present but not at 5? 
        In ""DEITY"", we put T at position 4? If T is at position 4 in the secret word, we get green? Otherwise, we get amber? 

        Also, E is at position 2? We haven't tried E at 2? 

        So ""DEITY"" seems good? 

        But we haven't tried D, I, Y? 

        However, we must check: are there any other constraints? 

        Also, note: we are putting T at position 4? And E at position 2? 

        This word is valid? 

        But we must make sure that we are not using any absent letters? D, E, I, T, Y -> all are not in the absent list? 

        Absent: C,R,A,N,S,L,P -> so D, I, T, E, Y are okay? 

        So ""DEITY"" is a candidate? 

Option: E at position 4? 
   Then: _ _ _ E _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TUNED"" -> T, U, N, E, D -> N absent? 
        ""TYPED"" -> T, Y, P, E, D -> P absent? 
        ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> M and D? 
            But we haven't tried M and D? 
            ""TIMED"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) -> avoids absent? 
            But we know T is present and not at 5? Here T is at 1? 
            E is at 4? 
            This word tests T, I, M, E, D? 

        So ""TIMED"" is a candidate? 

   Or T at position 2: _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> U, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> O, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> I, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ATEES"" -> A absent? 

   Or T at position 3: _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OCTET"" -> O, C, T, E, T -> C absent? 
        ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> N absent? 
        ""UNTIL"" -> N and L absent? 

   Or T at position 4: but we have E at 4? So we cannot put T at 4? 

So we have two strong candidates: 
   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5)

But note: in ""DEITY"", we are putting T at position 4? And in ""TIMED"", we are putting T at position 1? 

We know T is present? But we don't know its position? 

Also, we are testing E at position 2 in ""DEITY"" and at position 4 in ""TIMED""? 

We haven't tried E at position 1? But we don't have a candidate with E at 1? 

But we can also consider other words? 

Another candidate: what about E at position 1? 
   We had trouble? 
   How about ""EDIFY"": E, D, I, F, Y -> avoids absent? 
        E(1), D(2), I(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 1? 
        And we are testing D, I, F, Y? 
        But we are not testing T? We must include T? 

   We must include T? Because T is present? 

   So we cannot skip T? 

   Therefore, we must have both E and T? 

   So ""EDIFY"" doesn't have T? 

   How about ""EDIT"": only 4 letters? 

   How about ""TEDDY"": T, E, D, D, Y -> double D? 
        T(1), E(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 2? 
        And T at 1? 
        This word has T and E? 
        But double D? 
        And avoids absent? 
        But we are testing D? 

   But we are not sure if the word has double letters? 

   However, we can try? 

   But ""TEDDY"" is a word? 

   But we are testing D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

   But we are forced to include T and E? 

   So ""TEDDY"" is a candidate? 

   But we have ""DEITY"" and ""TIMED"" as well? 

   Now, comparing:

   ""DEITY"": 
        E at position 2 (new position for E)
        T at position 4 (new position for T, since we only tried T at 5)
        Tests D, I, Y (new letters)

   ""TIMED"":
        T at position 1 (new for T)
        E at position 4 (new for E, since we tried E at 3 and 5, but not 4)
        Tests I, M, D (new letters)

   ""TEDDY"":
        T at position 1, E at position 2, and D at 3 and 4? 
        But we are testing D? 
        And Y? 
        But double D? 

   We might avoid double letters to test more distinct letters? 

   So ""TEDDY"" tests only T, E, D, Y? But D is repeated? So we get less information? 

   Therefore, I prefer ""DEITY"" or ""TIMED"". 

   Now, which one? 

   We haven't tested M? And we haven't tested Y? 

   Both are good? 

   But note: we know E is present and not at 3 or 5? So positions 1,2,4? 
   We are testing E at 2 in ""DEITY"" and at 4 in ""TIMED""? 

   Similarly, T is present and not at 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? 
   In ""DEITY"", T is at 4? In ""TIMED"", T is at 1? 

   We might choose based on common positions? 

   E is common at position 4? T is common at position 1? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a vowel? Both test I? 

   But we haven't tested O or U? 

   How about a word with O? 

   For example, with E at 2 and T at 1? 
        T E _ _ _ 
        We need a word with O? 
        ""TEPID"" -> P absent? 
        ""TENOR"" -> N and R absent? 
        ""TELLY"" -> L absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TETRA"" -> R and A absent? 
        ""TOUCH"" -> C absent? 

   How about T at 1 and E at 4? 
        T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TIMED"" (which we have) -> but doesn't have O? 
        ""TONED"" -> N absent? 
        ""TOPED"" -> P absent? 
        ""TORSE"" -> R and S absent? 
        ""TOUSE"" -> S absent? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 2? 
        E T _ _ _ 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> C absent? 
        ""ETHOS"" -> S absent? 
        ""ETUDE"" -> E at 5? Not allowed? 
        ""ETWAS"" -> not a word? 

   How about E at 4 and T at 2? 
        _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""OTHER"" -> O, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> R absent? 

   It seems hard to include O? 

   How about U? 

   For example, E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EUTER"" -> not a word? 
        ""ENTER"" -> N and R absent? 

   E at 2 and T at 3? 
        _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETEL"" -> L absent? 
        ""FETUS"" -> F, E, T, U, S -> S absent? 
        ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A and L absent? 
        ""METRO"" -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> C absent? 

   E at 4 and T at 3? 
        _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> avoids absent? 
            O(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5) -> tests O, U, T, E, D? 
            And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 
            This word tests O and U? 

        ""OUTED"" is a candidate? 

   So we have a new candidate: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D

   This tests O, U, D? And we have T and E? 

   But we are testing two vowels? 

   And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 

   Now, comparing:

   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> tests I and Y? 
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> tests I and M? 
   Candidate 3: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> tests O, U? 

   We haven't tested I, O, U? 

   We might want to test a vowel? 

   Since we haven't tested any of I, O, U? And we know the word has E? But we don't know about other vowels? 

   Testing two vowels at once? 

   But we have limited guesses? 

   Alternatively, we can test one vowel? 

   But ""OUTED"" tests two? 

   However, it might be efficient? 

   Also, we are testing D? 

   But we are repeating D? 

   Actually, we are testing D? 

   Now, which candidate is best? 

   We can choose ""OUTED"" because it tests two new vowels? 

   But note: we are putting T at position 3? And E at position 4? 

   We haven't tried T at 3? Or E at 4? 

   So it's good? 

   But we must avoid absent letters? O, U, T, E, D -> all are not in the absent list? 

   So ""OUTED"" is valid? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""DEITY"" to test Y? 

   But Y is less common? 

   I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But let me see: 
        In ""OUTED"", we have:
            O at 1, U at 2, T at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

        If we get feedback, we can know about O, U, D? 

        And we already know T and E are present? 

        Also, if E is at position 4 and it is green? Then we know E is at 4? 
        Similarly, if T is at 3 and green? 

        But if they are not, we get amber? 

   So I think it's good? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Another candidate: ""MIGHT"" -> but no E? 

   We must include E? 

   So I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But wait: we are putting E at position 4? We know E is not at 3 or 5? But we don't know about 4? 
   Similarly, T at 3? We don't know about 3? 

   So we are testing two positions? 

   Therefore, I will go with ""OUTED"". 

   So the guess is ""OUTED"". 

   But let me confirm: 
        O: not tried? 
        U: not tried? 
        T: present, but we are trying at position 3? 
        E: present, at position 4? 
        D: not tried? 

   And the word is valid? 

   Yes. 

   So: <guess>outed</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(absent), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, N are **not in the word**.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: ""slept""**  
  Feedback: S(absent), L(absent), E(present but wrong position), P(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - S, L, P are **not in the word**.  
  - E is **not in position 3** (since it was guessed there but is present elsewhere).  
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  
   - **T** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, since position 5 is ruled out).

2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P (cannot be used).  
3. **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must include **E** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Avoid all absent letters.  
   - Test **E in a new position** (1, 2, or 4) and **T in a new position** (1, 2, 3, or 4).  
   - Prioritize untested **vowels (I, O, U)** and common consonants to maximize information.  
   - Ideal word should test multiple new letters and positions efficiently.

### Chosen Guess: ""OUTED""
- **Breakdown**:  
  - O (position 1) → Untested vowel.  
  - U (position 2) → Untested vowel.  
  - T (position 3) → Tests T in a new position (previously tried at position 5).  
  - E (position 4) → Tests E in a new position (previously tried at positions 3 and 5).  
  - D (position 5) → Untested consonant.  

- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **two new vowels (O and U)** and a new consonant **(D)**, while covering E and T.  
  - Positions 3 and 4 for T and E are untested and common in 5-letter words.  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct characters for maximum information gain.  
  - If E or T appear in their guessed positions, we get positional confirmation; if not, we narrow down possibilities.

<guess>outed</guess>",outed,"We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""slept"" -> S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)
Meaning: S, L, P are absent. E is present but not in position 3 (since we put it at position 3 and got '-'). T is present but not in position 5 (because we put T at position 5 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
Present letters: E (but not at position 3 or 5), T (but not at position 5)

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, T is present but not at position 5, so T must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Must include E and T (since they are present)
- Must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
- We should try to position E in one of the possible positions (1,2,4) and T in one of the possible positions (1,2,3,4) to get more information.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 7 absent (C,R,A,N,S,L,P) and minus the 2 present (E,T) that we know? But note: we don't know if there are more letters? We have to use only the remaining letters.

Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, P -> 7 letters.
Present: E, T -> 2 letters.

But the word has 5 letters, so we need 3 more letters that are not absent and not E or T? But E and T are already present, so they can be used again? However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can use E and T again? But we are not forced to? Actually, we must include E and T at least once? But we can include them multiple times? But that might not be efficient? 

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters? However, since we are trying to get information, it's better to use distinct letters? 

So, we have 26 - 7 = 19 letters available? But we have already used E and T? But they are available to use? The absent letters are the ones we cannot use. So available letters: all letters except C,R,A,N,S,L,P. That is: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and also E and T? 

But E and T are present? So we can use them? 

So the available set: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word that has E and T? And we have to use three more letters from the above? 

We also have constraints on the positions of E and T.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,4 (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We can try to put E and T in positions that we haven't tried? 

For example, we haven't tried E at position 1 or 2 or 4? And T at position 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we have tried T at position 5? And we know it's not at 5? 

We haven't tried T at positions 1,2,3,4? 

Similarly, we tried E at position 3 and 5? So we haven't tried 1,2,4? 

We can try to put E at position 1 and T at position 2? Or E at 2 and T at 1? Etc.

But we also need to choose the other letters? 

We want to maximize information? So we should choose common letters that we haven't tried? 

Common letters from the available set: 
   Vowels: I, O, U? (we haven't tested any of these? We tested A and E? A is absent, E is present? So we need to test I, O, U? 
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, etc.

We can try to include a vowel? 

Let me try to form words that have E and T and one of I, O, U? 

Also, we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Option: E at position 1? 
   Then the word starts with E? 
   Then we need T in one of 2,3,4? 
   Example: 
        E _ _ _ _ 
        We can put T at position 2: E T _ _ _ 
        Then we need three more letters? 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> but H is available? But C is absent? Cannot use C? 
        ""ETHYL"": E, T, H, Y, L -> but L is absent? Cannot use L? 
        ""ETUDE"": E, T, U, D, E -> has E twice? And U? 
            But E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? Because the secret word doesn't have E at 5? 
            So we must avoid putting E at 5? 
            Therefore, ""ETUDE"" is invalid because it has E at 5? 
        ""ETUIS"": E, T, U, I, S -> but S is absent? 
        ""ETWAS"": not a word? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EATEN"" -> A and N absent? 
        ""EJECT"" -> C and J? C absent? 
        ""EMPTY"" -> M, P, T, Y? But P is absent? 
        ""ENTER"" -> E, N, T, E, R -> N and R absent? 
        ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> T at position 5? But we are putting T at 3? 
            Actually, ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> T at 5? But we want T at 3? 
        How about ""EIGHT"" doesn't fit? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 4? 
        E _ _ T _ 
        Words: ""EJECT"" -> C absent? 
        ""EXIST"" -> X, I, S, T -> S absent? 
        ""ELATE"" -> L and A absent? 
        ""EVENT"" -> V, E, N, T -> N absent? 

   This is difficult? 

Option: E at position 2? 
   Then: _ E _ _ _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T E _ _ _ 
        Words: ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> double E and double T? 
        ""TEACH"" -> A and C absent? 
        ""TEASE"" -> A and S absent? 
        ""TEMPT"" -> M, P, T -> P absent? 
        ""TENET"" -> N absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? 
        ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> P absent? 

   How about T at position 3: _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""METRO"" -> M, E, T, R, O -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> V, E, T, C, H -> C absent? 

   How about T at position 4: _ E _ T _ 
        Words: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> we already considered? But D is available? 
            But we haven't tried D? 
            ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is at position 4? 
            However, we know T is present and not at position 5? But we don't know about position 4? 
            Also, E is at position 2? 
            This word uses D, I, Y? 
            And avoids absent letters? 
            So ""DEITY"" is a valid word? 

        But wait: in the second guess, we tried ""slept"" and got T(-) at position 5? So T is present but not at 5? 
        In ""DEITY"", we put T at position 4? If T is at position 4 in the secret word, we get green? Otherwise, we get amber? 

        Also, E is at position 2? We haven't tried E at 2? 

        So ""DEITY"" seems good? 

        But we haven't tried D, I, Y? 

        However, we must check: are there any other constraints? 

        Also, note: we are putting T at position 4? And E at position 2? 

        This word is valid? 

        But we must make sure that we are not using any absent letters? D, E, I, T, Y -> all are not in the absent list? 

        Absent: C,R,A,N,S,L,P -> so D, I, T, E, Y are okay? 

        So ""DEITY"" is a candidate? 

Option: E at position 4? 
   Then: _ _ _ E _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TUNED"" -> T, U, N, E, D -> N absent? 
        ""TYPED"" -> T, Y, P, E, D -> P absent? 
        ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> M and D? 
            But we haven't tried M and D? 
            ""TIMED"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) -> avoids absent? 
            But we know T is present and not at 5? Here T is at 1? 
            E is at 4? 
            This word tests T, I, M, E, D? 

        So ""TIMED"" is a candidate? 

   Or T at position 2: _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> U, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> O, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> I, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ATEES"" -> A absent? 

   Or T at position 3: _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OCTET"" -> O, C, T, E, T -> C absent? 
        ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> N absent? 
        ""UNTIL"" -> N and L absent? 

   Or T at position 4: but we have E at 4? So we cannot put T at 4? 

So we have two strong candidates: 
   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5)

But note: in ""DEITY"", we are putting T at position 4? And in ""TIMED"", we are putting T at position 1? 

We know T is present? But we don't know its position? 

Also, we are testing E at position 2 in ""DEITY"" and at position 4 in ""TIMED""? 

We haven't tried E at position 1? But we don't have a candidate with E at 1? 

But we can also consider other words? 

Another candidate: what about E at position 1? 
   We had trouble? 
   How about ""EDIFY"": E, D, I, F, Y -> avoids absent? 
        E(1), D(2), I(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 1? 
        And we are testing D, I, F, Y? 
        But we are not testing T? We must include T? 

   We must include T? Because T is present? 

   So we cannot skip T? 

   Therefore, we must have both E and T? 

   So ""EDIFY"" doesn't have T? 

   How about ""EDIT"": only 4 letters? 

   How about ""TEDDY"": T, E, D, D, Y -> double D? 
        T(1), E(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 2? 
        And T at 1? 
        This word has T and E? 
        But double D? 
        And avoids absent? 
        But we are testing D? 

   But we are not sure if the word has double letters? 

   However, we can try? 

   But ""TEDDY"" is a word? 

   But we are testing D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

   But we are forced to include T and E? 

   So ""TEDDY"" is a candidate? 

   But we have ""DEITY"" and ""TIMED"" as well? 

   Now, comparing:

   ""DEITY"": 
        E at position 2 (new position for E)
        T at position 4 (new position for T, since we only tried T at 5)
        Tests D, I, Y (new letters)

   ""TIMED"":
        T at position 1 (new for T)
        E at position 4 (new for E, since we tried E at 3 and 5, but not 4)
        Tests I, M, D (new letters)

   ""TEDDY"":
        T at position 1, E at position 2, and D at 3 and 4? 
        But we are testing D? 
        And Y? 
        But double D? 

   We might avoid double letters to test more distinct letters? 

   So ""TEDDY"" tests only T, E, D, Y? But D is repeated? So we get less information? 

   Therefore, I prefer ""DEITY"" or ""TIMED"". 

   Now, which one? 

   We haven't tested M? And we haven't tested Y? 

   Both are good? 

   But note: we know E is present and not at 3 or 5? So positions 1,2,4? 
   We are testing E at 2 in ""DEITY"" and at 4 in ""TIMED""? 

   Similarly, T is present and not at 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? 
   In ""DEITY"", T is at 4? In ""TIMED"", T is at 1? 

   We might choose based on common positions? 

   E is common at position 4? T is common at position 1? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a vowel? Both test I? 

   But we haven't tested O or U? 

   How about a word with O? 

   For example, with E at 2 and T at 1? 
        T E _ _ _ 
        We need a word with O? 
        ""TEPID"" -> P absent? 
        ""TENOR"" -> N and R absent? 
        ""TELLY"" -> L absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TETRA"" -> R and A absent? 
        ""TOUCH"" -> C absent? 

   How about T at 1 and E at 4? 
        T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TIMED"" (which we have) -> but doesn't have O? 
        ""TONED"" -> N absent? 
        ""TOPED"" -> P absent? 
        ""TORSE"" -> R and S absent? 
        ""TOUSE"" -> S absent? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 2? 
        E T _ _ _ 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> C absent? 
        ""ETHOS"" -> S absent? 
        ""ETUDE"" -> E at 5? Not allowed? 
        ""ETWAS"" -> not a word? 

   How about E at 4 and T at 2? 
        _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""OTHER"" -> O, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> R absent? 

   It seems hard to include O? 

   How about U? 

   For example, E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EUTER"" -> not a word? 
        ""ENTER"" -> N and R absent? 

   E at 2 and T at 3? 
        _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETEL"" -> L absent? 
        ""FETUS"" -> F, E, T, U, S -> S absent? 
        ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A and L absent? 
        ""METRO"" -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> C absent? 

   E at 4 and T at 3? 
        _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> avoids absent? 
            O(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5) -> tests O, U, T, E, D? 
            And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 
            This word tests O and U? 

        ""OUTED"" is a candidate? 

   So we have a new candidate: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D

   This tests O, U, D? And we have T and E? 

   But we are testing two vowels? 

   And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 

   Now, comparing:

   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> tests I and Y? 
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> tests I and M? 
   Candidate 3: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> tests O, U? 

   We haven't tested I, O, U? 

   We might want to test a vowel? 

   Since we haven't tested any of I, O, U? And we know the word has E? But we don't know about other vowels? 

   Testing two vowels at once? 

   But we have limited guesses? 

   Alternatively, we can test one vowel? 

   But ""OUTED"" tests two? 

   However, it might be efficient? 

   Also, we are testing D? 

   But we are repeating D? 

   Actually, we are testing D? 

   Now, which candidate is best? 

   We can choose ""OUTED"" because it tests two new vowels? 

   But note: we are putting T at position 3? And E at position 4? 

   We haven't tried T at 3? Or E at 4? 

   So it's good? 

   But we must avoid absent letters? O, U, T, E, D -> all are not in the absent list? 

   So ""OUTED"" is valid? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""DEITY"" to test Y? 

   But Y is less common? 

   I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But let me see: 
        In ""OUTED"", we have:
            O at 1, U at 2, T at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

        If we get feedback, we can know about O, U, D? 

        And we already know T and E are present? 

        Also, if E is at position 4 and it is green? Then we know E is at 4? 
        Similarly, if T is at 3 and green? 

        But if they are not, we get amber? 

   So I think it's good? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Another candidate: ""MIGHT"" -> but no E? 

   We must include E? 

   So I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But wait: we are putting E at position 4? We know E is not at 3 or 5? But we don't know about 4? 
   Similarly, T at 3? We don't know about 3? 

   So we are testing two positions? 

   Therefore, I will go with ""OUTED"". 

   So the guess is ""OUTED"". 

   But let me confirm: 
        O: not tried? 
        U: not tried? 
        T: present, but we are trying at position 3? 
        E: present, at position 4? 
        D: not tried? 

   And the word is valid? 

   Yes. 

   So: <guess>outed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(absent), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, N are **not in the word**.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: ""slept""**  
  Feedback: S(absent), L(absent), E(present but wrong position), P(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - S, L, P are **not in the word**.  
  - E is **not in position 3** (since it was guessed there but is present elsewhere).  
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  
   - **T** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, since position 5 is ruled out).

2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P (cannot be used).  
3. **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must include **E** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Avoid all absent letters.  
   - Test **E in a new position** (1, 2, or 4) and **T in a new position** (1, 2, 3, or 4).  
   - Prioritize untested **vowels (I, O, U)** and common consonants to maximize information.  
   - Ideal word should test multiple new letters and positions efficiently.

### Chosen Guess: ""OUTED""
- **Breakdown**:  
  - O (position 1) → Untested vowel.  
  - U (position 2) → Untested vowel.  
  - T (position 3) → Tests T in a new position (previously tried at position 5).  
  - E (position 4) → Tests E in a new position (previously tried at positions 3 and 5).  
  - D (position 5) → Untested consonant.  

- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **two new vowels (O and U)** and a new consonant **(D)**, while covering E and T.  
  - Positions 3 and 4 for T and E are untested and common in 5-letter words.  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct characters for maximum information gain.  
  - If E or T appear in their guessed positions, we get positional confirmation; if not, we narrow down possibilities.",Guess 3: outed -> FEEDBACK: O(x) U(x) T(-) E(-) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,HEFTY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet. It's the first guess.
 To maximize the information gained, we should choose a word that has common letters and no repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. Let's pick one that uses common vowels and consonants.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"":
 - C, R, A, N, E are all common letters.

 This will give us good information about which letters are present and their positions.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 From this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the 5th position.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Must be a valid 5-letter word.
 2. Must include the letter E (because we know it's in the word) and avoid using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. We have to choose letters that are still possible. Since we know E is somewhere in the word, we can try to put E in different positions.

 Also, we can use other common letters that haven't been ruled out. The absence of C, R, A, N means we have to choose from the remaining letters.

 Common letters not tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Considering the English language, we might want a word that has E and other common consonants and vowels.

 We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so we can try placing E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, note that we have very limited information. Let's think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - We could try words starting with E? But note we don't know if E is at the start or not. Alternatively, we might try words where E is in the middle.

 Since we only know one letter (E) and it can be in many positions, we might also try to get more information about other vowels and common consonants.

 The word must contain E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's brainstorm some words:

 - Words ending with E are common, but we know E isn't at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it can't be the last letter. So words ending with E are not allowed? Actually, no: we can still use words that have E in other positions? Actually, it doesn't matter because we're not forced to have E at the end. But note our guess must be a valid word, and it can have E anywhere except the 5th? Actually, no: the secret word has E somewhere (but not at position 5). Our next guess can have E in any position because we don't know where it is in the secret word. However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Possible words: 
 - ""TABLE"": but has A? A is ruled out -> no, A is not allowed because it was marked absent. Similarly, ""STALE"" has A and E but A is not allowed.

 Let's think of words without A, C, R, N and including E.

 Some ideas: 
 - ""FIGHT"": no E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, we know the secret word has E, but our next guess doesn't have to include E? 
   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about other letters. But note: we are allowed to guess words without E, but that wouldn't help us confirm the E position. Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.

 So, we want a word that:
   includes E (to gain more positional info),
   avoids C, R, A, N,
   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.

 Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.

 Words without C, R, A, N: 
   Possible words: 
     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That's position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be '-' if the secret word has E in a different position? 

 Actually, note: 
   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. 
   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: 
        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be '-' (because it's in the secret but not at position 5).
        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don't know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.

 So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get '-' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word's E isn't at 5). But note: we don't know if there might be two E's? The word might have more than one E? But we haven't ruled that out.

 However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.

 Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it's correct.

 Let's consider: 
   Position 1: E
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: E

 We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.

 Example words: 
   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.
   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? 
      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? 
      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? 
      However, note: the secret word might not have two E's. But we don't know.

 But let's consider the letters: 
   E is known to be present (at least one). 
   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.

 Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? 
   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked '-' if the secret word has E elsewhere.

 However, if we put E at a position we haven't tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it's correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn't at 5 in the secret. 

 But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won't test a new position.

 Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.

 So, let's try to avoid putting E in position 5.

 Also, we want to test new letters: 
   What letters haven't been tried? 
   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we've tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.

 So, let me try to form a word that:
   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4
   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

 Words:

   Position 1: E
      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.
      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E's, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. 

   How about: 
      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don't know if E is the first letter. This is valid.

   Position 2: E
      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> 
      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.
      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.

   Position 3: E
      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? 
      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. 
      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.

      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? 
        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? 
        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.

   Position 4: E
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.

 So we have a few options: 
   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.
   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.
   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.

 But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.

 How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried? 
   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.

 Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?

 We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.

 Since we only know E is in the word, and we don't know about other vowels? We haven't tested O, I, U? 

 Let me check: 
   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven't tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U? And E is present? 

 The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don't know? 

 So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? 

 In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? 

 Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? 

 How about a word with O and E? 

 Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? 

 But O is a vowel we haven't tested? That's good? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That's fine? 

 Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it's okay.

 But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven't used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.

 But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.

 However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.

 So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? 

 Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.

 After considering, let's think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? 

 But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".

 Now, which word to pick? 

 Criteria: 
   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? 
   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? 
   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? 

 ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? 
 ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? 
 ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? 
 ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? 

 All distinct? 

 Let me compare: 
   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it's green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don't know? But if it's amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? 

   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? 

   Since we don't know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? 

   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? 

   Which word tests more common letters? 

   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? 
   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? 
   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? 
   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 

   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? 

   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don't know? 

   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? 

   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? 

   Also, S is the last letter? We haven't tested S? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don't test E? 

   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? 

   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? 

   Let me see: 
      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? 

   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don't know? But our guesses don't have duplicates? 

   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? 

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn't get any green? 

   Alternatively, let's try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven't eliminated? And also test many common letters? 

   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? 

   Words with E at position 2: 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? 
      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.

   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? 

   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? 

   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? 

   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? 

   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? 

   Comparing:
      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? 
      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? 

   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? 

   Now, which gives more information? 
      For E: 
        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? 
        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? 
      But we don't know? Either way we narrow down? 

   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? 

   Since the first word ""crane"" didn't give any hits in any position? We have no information? 

   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? 

   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? 

   Alternatively, let's consider the frequency. 

   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? 
      Actually, E can be at many positions? 

   We can also consider word lists? But we don't have them.

   Given that, I'll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? 

   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? 

   After reconsidering: 
      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? 
      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? 

   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? 

   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? 

   Actually, we might get green? We don't know? 

   So, I think either is fine? 

   But note: we are also testing other letters? 

   The letter T: We haven't tested T? It's common? So let's test T? 

   Also, S is common so we might test S? 

   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? 

   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

   T is tested in both? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? 

   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? 

   Actually, we haven't tested B, L, U, S? 

   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? 

   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? 

   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? 

   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? 

   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? 

   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? 

   Therefore, I'll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? 

   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that's not an option? 

   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? 

   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don't know? 

   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? 

   This tests S, L, E, P, T? 

   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? 

   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? 

   But note: we haven't tried P and L? 

   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? 

   Making a decision: 
      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y
      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S
      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T

   Let me compare the letters: 
      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? 
      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S
      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? 

   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? 

   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? 

   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? 

   And we do not use any forbidden letter? 

   Also, E at position 3? 

   This word seems very efficient? 

   How common are the letters? 
      T: very common? 
      E: known to be in? 
      S: very common? 
      L: common? 
      P: common? 

   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? 

   Final choice: ""SLEPT""

   But note: we haven't tried S, L, P, T? 

   So this tests five new letters? And E? 

   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? 

   Yes? 

   Therefore, let's guess ""SLEPT"".

   Steps: 
     SLEPT: 
        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)

   We hope for greens? 

   So: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:
- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)
- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)
- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations
- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information

The word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:
- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)
- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities

<guess>slept</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) E(-) P(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""slept"" -> S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)
Meaning: S, L, P are absent. E is present but not in position 3 (since we put it at position 3 and got '-'). T is present but not in position 5 (because we put T at position 5 and got '-').

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
Present letters: E (but not at position 3 or 5), T (but not at position 5)

We also know that E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

Similarly, T is present but not at position 5, so T must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Must include E and T (since they are present)
- Must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P
- We should try to position E in one of the possible positions (1,2,4) and T in one of the possible positions (1,2,3,4) to get more information.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 7 absent (C,R,A,N,S,L,P) and minus the 2 present (E,T) that we know? But note: we don't know if there are more letters? We have to use only the remaining letters.

Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, P -> 7 letters.
Present: E, T -> 2 letters.

But the word has 5 letters, so we need 3 more letters that are not absent and not E or T? But E and T are already present, so they can be used again? However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can use E and T again? But we are not forced to? Actually, we must include E and T at least once? But we can include them multiple times? But that might not be efficient? 

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters? However, since we are trying to get information, it's better to use distinct letters? 

So, we have 26 - 7 = 19 letters available? But we have already used E and T? But they are available to use? The absent letters are the ones we cannot use. So available letters: all letters except C,R,A,N,S,L,P. That is: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and also E and T? 

But E and T are present? So we can use them? 

So the available set: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word that has E and T? And we have to use three more letters from the above? 

We also have constraints on the positions of E and T.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,4 (since not 3 or 5)
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We can try to put E and T in positions that we haven't tried? 

For example, we haven't tried E at position 1 or 2 or 4? And T at position 1,2,3,4? 

But note: we have tried T at position 5? And we know it's not at 5? 

We haven't tried T at positions 1,2,3,4? 

Similarly, we tried E at position 3 and 5? So we haven't tried 1,2,4? 

We can try to put E at position 1 and T at position 2? Or E at 2 and T at 1? Etc.

But we also need to choose the other letters? 

We want to maximize information? So we should choose common letters that we haven't tried? 

Common letters from the available set: 
   Vowels: I, O, U? (we haven't tested any of these? We tested A and E? A is absent, E is present? So we need to test I, O, U? 
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, etc.

We can try to include a vowel? 

Let me try to form words that have E and T and one of I, O, U? 

Also, we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Option: E at position 1? 
   Then the word starts with E? 
   Then we need T in one of 2,3,4? 
   Example: 
        E _ _ _ _ 
        We can put T at position 2: E T _ _ _ 
        Then we need three more letters? 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> but H is available? But C is absent? Cannot use C? 
        ""ETHYL"": E, T, H, Y, L -> but L is absent? Cannot use L? 
        ""ETUDE"": E, T, U, D, E -> has E twice? And U? 
            But E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? Because the secret word doesn't have E at 5? 
            So we must avoid putting E at 5? 
            Therefore, ""ETUDE"" is invalid because it has E at 5? 
        ""ETUIS"": E, T, U, I, S -> but S is absent? 
        ""ETWAS"": not a word? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EATEN"" -> A and N absent? 
        ""EJECT"" -> C and J? C absent? 
        ""EMPTY"" -> M, P, T, Y? But P is absent? 
        ""ENTER"" -> E, N, T, E, R -> N and R absent? 
        ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> T at position 5? But we are putting T at 3? 
            Actually, ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> T at 5? But we want T at 3? 
        How about ""EIGHT"" doesn't fit? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 4? 
        E _ _ T _ 
        Words: ""EJECT"" -> C absent? 
        ""EXIST"" -> X, I, S, T -> S absent? 
        ""ELATE"" -> L and A absent? 
        ""EVENT"" -> V, E, N, T -> N absent? 

   This is difficult? 

Option: E at position 2? 
   Then: _ E _ _ _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T E _ _ _ 
        Words: ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> double E and double T? 
        ""TEACH"" -> A and C absent? 
        ""TEASE"" -> A and S absent? 
        ""TEMPT"" -> M, P, T -> P absent? 
        ""TENET"" -> N absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? 
        ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> P absent? 

   How about T at position 3: _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> double T? 
        ""METRO"" -> M, E, T, R, O -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> V, E, T, C, H -> C absent? 

   How about T at position 4: _ E _ T _ 
        Words: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> we already considered? But D is available? 
            But we haven't tried D? 
            ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is at position 4? 
            However, we know T is present and not at position 5? But we don't know about position 4? 
            Also, E is at position 2? 
            This word uses D, I, Y? 
            And avoids absent letters? 
            So ""DEITY"" is a valid word? 

        But wait: in the second guess, we tried ""slept"" and got T(-) at position 5? So T is present but not at 5? 
        In ""DEITY"", we put T at position 4? If T is at position 4 in the secret word, we get green? Otherwise, we get amber? 

        Also, E is at position 2? We haven't tried E at 2? 

        So ""DEITY"" seems good? 

        But we haven't tried D, I, Y? 

        However, we must check: are there any other constraints? 

        Also, note: we are putting T at position 4? And E at position 2? 

        This word is valid? 

        But we must make sure that we are not using any absent letters? D, E, I, T, Y -> all are not in the absent list? 

        Absent: C,R,A,N,S,L,P -> so D, I, T, E, Y are okay? 

        So ""DEITY"" is a candidate? 

Option: E at position 4? 
   Then: _ _ _ E _ 
   And we can put T at position 1: T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TUNED"" -> T, U, N, E, D -> N absent? 
        ""TYPED"" -> T, Y, P, E, D -> P absent? 
        ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> M and D? 
            But we haven't tried M and D? 
            ""TIMED"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) -> avoids absent? 
            But we know T is present and not at 5? Here T is at 1? 
            E is at 4? 
            This word tests T, I, M, E, D? 

        So ""TIMED"" is a candidate? 

   Or T at position 2: _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> U, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> O, T, T, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> I, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""ATEES"" -> A absent? 

   Or T at position 3: _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OCTET"" -> O, C, T, E, T -> C absent? 
        ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> N absent? 
        ""UNTIL"" -> N and L absent? 

   Or T at position 4: but we have E at 4? So we cannot put T at 4? 

So we have two strong candidates: 
   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5)

But note: in ""DEITY"", we are putting T at position 4? And in ""TIMED"", we are putting T at position 1? 

We know T is present? But we don't know its position? 

Also, we are testing E at position 2 in ""DEITY"" and at position 4 in ""TIMED""? 

We haven't tried E at position 1? But we don't have a candidate with E at 1? 

But we can also consider other words? 

Another candidate: what about E at position 1? 
   We had trouble? 
   How about ""EDIFY"": E, D, I, F, Y -> avoids absent? 
        E(1), D(2), I(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 1? 
        And we are testing D, I, F, Y? 
        But we are not testing T? We must include T? 

   We must include T? Because T is present? 

   So we cannot skip T? 

   Therefore, we must have both E and T? 

   So ""EDIFY"" doesn't have T? 

   How about ""EDIT"": only 4 letters? 

   How about ""TEDDY"": T, E, D, D, Y -> double D? 
        T(1), E(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 2? 
        And T at 1? 
        This word has T and E? 
        But double D? 
        And avoids absent? 
        But we are testing D? 

   But we are not sure if the word has double letters? 

   However, we can try? 

   But ""TEDDY"" is a word? 

   But we are testing D? And we don't know if D is in the word? 

   But we are forced to include T and E? 

   So ""TEDDY"" is a candidate? 

   But we have ""DEITY"" and ""TIMED"" as well? 

   Now, comparing:

   ""DEITY"": 
        E at position 2 (new position for E)
        T at position 4 (new position for T, since we only tried T at 5)
        Tests D, I, Y (new letters)

   ""TIMED"":
        T at position 1 (new for T)
        E at position 4 (new for E, since we tried E at 3 and 5, but not 4)
        Tests I, M, D (new letters)

   ""TEDDY"":
        T at position 1, E at position 2, and D at 3 and 4? 
        But we are testing D? 
        And Y? 
        But double D? 

   We might avoid double letters to test more distinct letters? 

   So ""TEDDY"" tests only T, E, D, Y? But D is repeated? So we get less information? 

   Therefore, I prefer ""DEITY"" or ""TIMED"". 

   Now, which one? 

   We haven't tested M? And we haven't tested Y? 

   Both are good? 

   But note: we know E is present and not at 3 or 5? So positions 1,2,4? 
   We are testing E at 2 in ""DEITY"" and at 4 in ""TIMED""? 

   Similarly, T is present and not at 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? 
   In ""DEITY"", T is at 4? In ""TIMED"", T is at 1? 

   We might choose based on common positions? 

   E is common at position 4? T is common at position 1? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a vowel? Both test I? 

   But we haven't tested O or U? 

   How about a word with O? 

   For example, with E at 2 and T at 1? 
        T E _ _ _ 
        We need a word with O? 
        ""TEPID"" -> P absent? 
        ""TENOR"" -> N and R absent? 
        ""TELLY"" -> L absent? 
        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? 
        ""TETRA"" -> R and A absent? 
        ""TOUCH"" -> C absent? 

   How about T at 1 and E at 4? 
        T _ _ E _ 
        Words: ""TIMED"" (which we have) -> but doesn't have O? 
        ""TONED"" -> N absent? 
        ""TOPED"" -> P absent? 
        ""TORSE"" -> R and S absent? 
        ""TOUSE"" -> S absent? 

   How about E at 1 and T at 2? 
        E T _ _ _ 
        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> C absent? 
        ""ETHOS"" -> S absent? 
        ""ETUDE"" -> E at 5? Not allowed? 
        ""ETWAS"" -> not a word? 

   How about E at 4 and T at 2? 
        _ T _ E _ 
        Words: ""UTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""OTHER"" -> O, T, H, E, R -> R absent? 
        ""OTTER"" -> R absent? 
        ""ITHER"" -> R absent? 

   It seems hard to include O? 

   How about U? 

   For example, E at 1 and T at 3? 
        E _ T _ _ 
        Words: ""EUTER"" -> not a word? 
        ""ENTER"" -> N and R absent? 

   E at 2 and T at 3? 
        _ E T _ _ 
        Words: ""BETEL"" -> L absent? 
        ""FETUS"" -> F, E, T, U, S -> S absent? 
        ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> A and L absent? 
        ""METRO"" -> R absent? 
        ""VETCH"" -> C absent? 

   E at 4 and T at 3? 
        _ _ T E _ 
        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? 
        ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> avoids absent? 
            O(1), U(2), T(3), E(4), D(5) -> tests O, U, T, E, D? 
            And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 
            This word tests O and U? 

        ""OUTED"" is a candidate? 

   So we have a new candidate: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D

   This tests O, U, D? And we have T and E? 

   But we are testing two vowels? 

   And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? 

   Now, comparing:

   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> tests I and Y? 
   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> tests I and M? 
   Candidate 3: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> tests O, U? 

   We haven't tested I, O, U? 

   We might want to test a vowel? 

   Since we haven't tested any of I, O, U? And we know the word has E? But we don't know about other vowels? 

   Testing two vowels at once? 

   But we have limited guesses? 

   Alternatively, we can test one vowel? 

   But ""OUTED"" tests two? 

   However, it might be efficient? 

   Also, we are testing D? 

   But we are repeating D? 

   Actually, we are testing D? 

   Now, which candidate is best? 

   We can choose ""OUTED"" because it tests two new vowels? 

   But note: we are putting T at position 3? And E at position 4? 

   We haven't tried T at 3? Or E at 4? 

   So it's good? 

   But we must avoid absent letters? O, U, T, E, D -> all are not in the absent list? 

   So ""OUTED"" is valid? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""DEITY"" to test Y? 

   But Y is less common? 

   I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But let me see: 
        In ""OUTED"", we have:
            O at 1, U at 2, T at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

        If we get feedback, we can know about O, U, D? 

        And we already know T and E are present? 

        Also, if E is at position 4 and it is green? Then we know E is at 4? 
        Similarly, if T is at 3 and green? 

        But if they are not, we get amber? 

   So I think it's good? 

   But we have to decide? 

   Another candidate: ""MIGHT"" -> but no E? 

   We must include E? 

   So I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? 

   But wait: we are putting E at position 4? We know E is not at 3 or 5? But we don't know about 4? 
   Similarly, T at 3? We don't know about 3? 

   So we are testing two positions? 

   Therefore, I will go with ""OUTED"". 

   So the guess is ""OUTED"". 

   But let me confirm: 
        O: not tried? 
        U: not tried? 
        T: present, but we are trying at position 3? 
        E: present, at position 4? 
        D: not tried? 

   And the word is valid? 

   Yes. 

   So: <guess>outed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(absent), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - C, R, A, N are **not in the word**.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: ""slept""**  
  Feedback: S(absent), L(absent), E(present but wrong position), P(absent), T(present but wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - S, L, P are **not in the word**.  
  - E is **not in position 3** (since it was guessed there but is present elsewhere).  
  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  
   - **T** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, since position 5 is ruled out).

2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P (cannot be used).  
3. **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must include **E** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Avoid all absent letters.  
   - Test **E in a new position** (1, 2, or 4) and **T in a new position** (1, 2, 3, or 4).  
   - Prioritize untested **vowels (I, O, U)** and common consonants to maximize information.  
   - Ideal word should test multiple new letters and positions efficiently.

### Chosen Guess: ""OUTED""
- **Breakdown**:  
  - O (position 1) → Untested vowel.  
  - U (position 2) → Untested vowel.  
  - T (position 3) → Tests T in a new position (previously tried at position 5).  
  - E (position 4) → Tests E in a new position (previously tried at positions 3 and 5).  
  - D (position 5) → Untested consonant.  

- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests **two new vowels (O and U)** and a new consonant **(D)**, while covering E and T.  
  - Positions 3 and 4 for T and E are untested and common in 5-letter words.  
  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct characters for maximum information gain.  
  - If E or T appear in their guessed positions, we get positional confirmation; if not, we narrow down possibilities.

Must be a valid 5-letter word.\n 2. Must include the letter E (because we know it\'s in the word) and avoid using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).\n 3. We have to choose letters that are still possible. Since we know E is somewhere in the word, we can try to put E in different positions.\n\n Also, we can use other common letters that haven\'t been ruled out.

Let\'s think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Possible words: \n - We could try words starting with E? But note we don\'t know if E is at the start or not. Alternatively, we might try words where E is in the middle.\n\n Since we only know one letter (E) and it can be in many positions, we might also try to get more information about other vowels and common consonants.\n\n The word must contain E and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm some words:\n\n - Words ending with E are common, but we know E isn\'t at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it can\'t be the last letter. So words ending with E are not allowed? Actually, no: we can still use words that have E in other positions? Actually, it doesn\'t matter because we\'re not forced to have E at the end. But note our guess must be a valid word, and it can have E anywhere except the 5th? Actually, no: the secret word has E somewhere (but not at position 5). Our next guess can have E in any position because we don\'t know where it is in the secret word. However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n Possible words: \n - ""TABLE"": but has A? A is ruled out -> no, A is not allowed because it was marked absent. Similarly, ""STALE"" has A and E but A is not allowed.\n\n Let\'s think of words without A, C, R, N and including E.\n\n Some ideas: \n - ""FIGHT"": no E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, we know the secret word has E, but our next guess doesn\'t have to include E? \n   However, if we don\'t include E, we might not get information about other letters. But note: we are allowed to guess words without E, but that wouldn\'t help us confirm the E position. Since we know E is in the word, it is wise to use a word that includes E so we can get more information about its position and also test new letters.\n\n So, we want a word that:\n   includes E (to gain more positional info),\n   avoids C, R, A, N,\n   has other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting new ones.\n\n Let me list common letters: E, T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n Words without C, R, A, N: \n   Possible words: \n     ""SPITE"": S, P, I, T, E -> includes E and avoids the forbidden letters. But E is at the end? That\'s position 5. But in the secret word, E is not at position 5. However, in our guess, we can put E at position 5? Because the secret word has E somewhere else. The feedback for E in our guess would probably be \'-\' if the secret word has E in a different position? \n\n Actually, note: \n   In the secret word, E is present and not at position 5. \n   If we put E at position 5 in our guess, the feedback for E would be: \n        - if the secret word has E at position 1,2,3, or 4, then E in our guess (position 5) would be \'-\' (because it\'s in the secret but not at position 5).\n        - if the secret word has E at two positions? But we don\'t know that. We only know it has at least one E and not at position 5.\n\n So guessing a word with E at position 5 is acceptable? Actually, it would still get \'-\' because E is in the word but in the wrong position (since we know the secret word\'s E isn\'t at 5). But note: we don\'t know if there might be two E\'s? The word might have more than one E? But we haven\'t ruled that out.\n\n However, to maximize information, we want to try E in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, we could try placing E in an earlier position to see if it\'s correct.\n\n Let\'s consider: \n   Position 1: E\n   Position 2: E\n   Position 3: E\n   Position 4: E\n\n We might test position 1 by having a word starting with E.\n\n Example words: \n   ""EJECT"": has E at start and also at end? but uses C and J? C is forbidden? We cannot use C.\n   ""EDGES"": has E at start and at end? Also avoids C,R,A,N? \n      E (1), D, G, E (4), S (5). But the secret word has E not at position 5? Our guess has E at 1 and 4? \n      This might be okay because we are testing multiple positions? \n      However, note: the secret word might not have two E\'s. But we don\'t know.\n\n But let\'s consider the letters: \n   E is known to be present (at least one). \n   We cannot use C, R, A, N in the guess.\n\n Another word: ""WHILE"": has W, H, I, L, E -> includes E at the end? E is at position 5? \n   But in our guess, we want to avoid putting E at position 5? Actually, no: we can. It will be marked \'-\' if the secret word has E elsewhere.\n\n However, if we put E at a position we haven\'t tried, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, then if it\'s correct we get a green. But if we put it at 5, we already know it will be amber? Because we know E isn\'t at 5 in the secret. \n\n But that would be a waste of a position? We are going to get an amber for sure? And we won\'t test a new position.\n\n Therefore, it would be better to put E in the positions that are still possible: positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n So, let\'s try to avoid putting E in position 5.\n\n Also, we want to test new letters: \n   What letters haven\'t been tried? \n   Previous guess: C, R, A, N, E -> so we\'ve tried E, and know E is present but C,R,A,N are absent.\n\n So, let me try to form a word that:\n   has E in position 1,2,3, or 4\n   uses other letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n Words:\n\n   Position 1: E\n      ""EBONY"": E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is forbidden? N was absent -> cannot use N.\n      ""ELITE"": E, L, I, T, E -> uses E twice? Also, avoids forbidden letters: L, I, T are okay? and E is okay. But note: the secret word might not have two E\'s, but we can test. This word has E at positions 1 and 5? Position 5 is E again. \n\n   How about: \n      ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes: I, G, H, T are not C,R,A,N. But note: E is at position 1? We don\'t know if E is the first letter. This is valid.\n\n   Position 2: E\n      ""BESTY"" (not a word) -> \n      ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden? Cannot use N.\n      ""PETAL"": P, E, T, A, L -> but A is forbidden? Cannot use A.\n\n   Position 3: E\n      ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Wait, T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But we need position 3? Let me check: E in position 3? \n      How about ""THIEF"": T, H, I, E, F -> E is at position 4? Not 3. \n      How about ""LODGE"": L, O, D, G, E -> E at position 5? Not what we want.\n\n      Actually, we want to put E at position 3? \n        ""GUESS"": G, U, E, S, S -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden letters. But has S twice? \n        ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E at position 3. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> avoids C,R,A,N. Valid.\n\n   Position 4: E\n      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at position 4? Valid and avoids forbidden letters.\n\n So we have a few options: \n   ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> tests E at start? Also tests I,G,H,T.\n   ""FIELD"": F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5) -> E at 3? Tests F,I,E,L,D.\n   ""TIMES"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), S(5) -> E at 4? Tests T,I,M,E,S.\n\n But note: we are also testing letters that might be present.\n\n How about using a word that includes common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n   Common consonants: L, T, S, etc.\n\n Given that, maybe ""TIMES"" or ""FIELD"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n We may also consider words that have a vowel in the second position? Because the secret word might have a particular vowel pattern.\n\n Since we only know E is in the word, and we don\'t know about other vowels? We haven\'t tested O, I, U? \n\n Let me check: \n   Our first guess ""crane"" had A and E? A was absent? So the secret word does not have A? And we haven\'t tested I, O, U? So the vowels we haven\'t tested are I, O, U? And E is present? \n\n The secret word must have E and possibly I, O, U? We don\'t know? \n\n So, to maximize information, we can include I, O, or U? \n\n In ""EIGHT"": has I -> we test I? In ""FIELD"": has I? In ""TIMES"": has I? So they all test I? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid I and test O? \n\n How about a word with O and E? \n\n Option: ""TOWED"": T, O, W, E, D -> E at position 4? Avoids forbidden: T, O, W, E, D -> not using C,R,A,N? \n\n But O is a vowel we haven\'t tested? That\'s good? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""TOWEL"" is invalid because it has E at position 4? And ends with L? But note: ""towel"" is a word? Well, actually, let me check: ""TOWEL"" has L at the end? We are allowed? But wait: we cannot put E at position 5 because we know the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5? But in ""towel"", E is at position 4? And L at position 5? That\'s fine? \n\n Actually, ""TOWEL"" has E at position 4? T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). That avoids forbidden letters? T, O, W, E, L -> no C,R,A,N? And note: the fifth letter is L, not E? So it\'s okay.\n\n But wait: we cannot use N? And we haven\'t used N? We are not using N? Actually, we know N is not in the word? So we avoid? So ""towel"" is okay? But what about R? We know R is absent? Also avoided? Yes.\n\n But wait: we must make sure the word is valid? ""TOWEL"" is valid? Yes.\n\n However, another word: ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but we know R is absent? We cannot use R. So invalid.\n\n So, ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> we test O and W? \n\n Alternatively, we could try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E at position 5? We want to avoid E at position 5? So we are forced to put E at 4? Then we have words like ""STORE"": but S, T, O, R, E -> R is forbidden? Cannot be.\n\n After considering, let\'s think of words with E in position 2? That might be harder? \n\n But we have ""FIELD"", ""TIMES"", ""TOWEL"", ""EIGHT"".\n\n Now, which word to pick? \n\n Criteria: \n   - Test E in a new position? We tried E in position 5? Now we try in another position? \n   - Also, test as many new letters as possible? \n   - Avoid repeated letters? Unless we are testing duplication? \n\n ""TOWEL"": tests T, O, W, E, L -> all distinct? \n ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> distinct? \n ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> distinct? \n ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> distinct? \n\n All distinct? \n\n Let me compare: \n   ""EIGHT"": E in position 1 -> if it\'s green, great? But if not, it will be amber? We still don\'t know? But if it\'s amber, then E is in the word but not first? Then we know it must be in positions 2-4? \n\n   Similarly, if we guess ""FIELD"" and E is at position 3? Then we can get direct green if it is the third? \n\n   Since we don\'t know the position, we can try a word that has E in a commonly occurring position? For example, E often occurs in the middle? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that allows us to cover more frequent letters? \n\n   Common letters in English: E, S, I, O, T, etc. We have already tested E? Now we want to test S, T, O? \n\n   Which word tests more common letters? \n\n   ""TOWEL"": has T, O, W, E, L -> T and O are common? \n   ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> T, I, M, S? \n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> less common letters? F, L, D? \n   ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? \n\n   Perhaps ""TOWEL"" or ""TIMES"" would be better? \n\n   But wait: we want to avoid using letters that might be rare? However, we don\'t know? \n\n   Another idea: we can select a word that includes S? Because S is very common? \n\n   Let me pick ""TIMES"" because it has T, I, M, E, S? We test M? M is common? \n\n   Also, S is the last letter? We haven\'t tested S? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is invalid because we need E not at the end? We can use E in position 4? How about ""SOUPY""? No E -> then we don\'t test E? \n\n   Since E is the only known letter, we should include it? \n\n   Therefore, I think ""TIMES"" or ""TOWEL""? \n\n   Let me see: \n      ""TIMES"": T at start? It might be common? Also, we test I? \n\n   Also, note: the word could have duplicate letters? We don\'t know? But our guesses don\'t have duplicates? \n\n   After evaluating, I think ""TIMES"" is a good word? \n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the second position? Then in ""TIMES"", E is in position 4? We get amber? We wouldn\'t get any green? \n\n   Alternatively, let\'s try to choose a word that places E in a position that we haven\'t eliminated? And also test many common letters? \n\n   Position 2 is a common position for E? How about we try a word with E at position 2? \n\n   Words with E at position 2: \n      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> valid? Avoids forbidden? D, E, I, T, Y -> not C,R,A,N? \n      ""LEMUR"": L, E, M, U, R -> but R is forbidden? Invalid.\n\n   ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5). This tests D, E (at position 2? If E is at position 2, we get green), I, T, Y? \n\n   This word tests E at a good position? Also, we test I and T? \n\n   Or ""PETTY"": P, E, T, T, Y -> but double T? And P? \n\n   But ""DEITY"" is a good word? And it includes I? \n\n   How about ""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D -> E at position 2? \n\n   But ""DEITY"" is a good alternative? \n\n   Comparing:\n      ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E at 4? \n      ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y -> E at 2? \n\n   Both are acceptable? And test distinct letters? \n\n   Now, which gives more information? \n      For E: \n        If we put E at position 2 and it is yellow again? Then we know E is not at position 2? Then we have positions 1, 3, 4 remaining? \n        If we put E at position 4 and it is yellow? Then we know E is not at 4? Then positions 1,2,3 remaining? \n      But we don\'t know? Either way we narrow down? \n\n   However, we note that E is common? It might be in position 2? \n\n   Since the first word ""crane"" didn\'t give any hits in any position? We have no information? \n\n   But also, note: we have 6 guesses? So we can afford to test? \n\n   I think we can choose ""DEITY""? \n\n   Alternatively, let\'s consider the frequency. \n\n   Common positions for E in 5-letter words? \n      Actually, E can be at many positions? \n\n   We can also consider word lists? But we don\'t have them.\n\n   Given that, I\'ll go with ""TIMES"" because S is common? \n\n   Or ""DEITY"" because it tests D and Y? \n\n   After reconsidering: \n      Previous guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5? That was amber? So we know E is in the word and not at position 5? \n      Now, if we put E at position 2 (like in ""DEITY"") and it becomes green? Then that would be excellent? And we narrow down? \n\n   But if it becomes amber? Then E is in the word but not at position 2? So we know E must be at 1,3, or 4? \n\n   Similarly, if we put E at position 4 and it is green? Great? Or amber? Then we know E is in the word but not at 4? So either 1,2, or 3? \n\n   Actually, we might get green? We don\'t know? \n\n   So, I think either is fine? \n\n   But note: we are also testing other letters? \n\n   The letter T: We haven\'t tested T? It\'s common? So let\'s test T? \n\n   Also, S is common so we might test S? \n\n   However, in ""TIMES"", we have T at position 1, I at position 2, M at position 3, E at position 4, S at position 5? \n\n   In ""DEITY"", D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? \n\n   T is tested in both? \n\n   We can choose one? \n\n   Since we are starting and want common letters, maybe ""TIMES"" is better? \n\n   Alternatively, let me pick ""BLUES"": B, L, U, E, S -> E at position 4? also U? But U is a vowel? \n\n   Actually, we haven\'t tested B, L, U, S? \n\n   How about ""QUEST"": Q, U, E, S, T -> includes Q which is rare? Maybe not? \n\n   Let me go with ""TIMES"" for now? \n\n   But wait: the feedback for E in the previous guess was amber? We know E is in the word and not at the end? \n\n   In ""TIMES"", we put E at position 4? This is different than the previous position (5)? So we test a new position? \n\n   Alternatively, ""DEITY"" tests E at position 2? \n\n   I think testing E at position 2 (which is a common position) might be better? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll choose ""DEITY"": D, E, I, T, Y? \n\n   Or maybe ""LIGHT"" without E? But we must have E? So that\'s not an option? \n\n   Considering everything, I propose ""TIMES"" as my next guess? \n\n   Or I found another word: ""SWEET"": double E? But we avoid because we don\'t know? \n\n   Actually, ""SLEPT"": S, L, E, P, T -> E at position 3? Avoids forbidden? Valid? \n\n   This tests S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   Which word tests more common letters? SLEPT: has S, L, E, P, T -> common? \n\n   Or ""SPELT"": S, P, E, L, T? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried P and L? \n\n   However, I think ""TIMES"" is good? \n\n   Making a decision: \n      Option 1: DEITY -> D, E, I, T, Y\n      Option 2: TIMES -> T, I, M, E, S\n      Option 3: SLEPT -> S, L, E, P, T\n\n   Let me compare the letters: \n      DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y -> covers E, I, T and D, Y? \n      TIMES: T, I, M, E, S -> covers T, I, M, E, S\n      SLEPT: S, L, E, P, T -> covers S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   SLEPT has T? But we are testing S and T? Both common? Also L and P? \n\n   In SLEPT, E is at position 3? \n\n   Since we want to test more common letters? SLEPT tests five common letters: S, L, E, P, T? \n\n   And we do not use any forbidden letter? \n\n   Also, E at position 3? \n\n   This word seems very efficient? \n\n   How common are the letters? \n      T: very common? \n      E: known to be in? \n      S: very common? \n      L: common? \n      P: common? \n\n   So, ""SLEPT"" might be a good choice? \n\n   Final choice: ""SLEPT""\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried S, L, P, T? \n\n   So this tests five new letters? And E? \n\n   Actually, E is already known? So we are testing four new letters? And also E at a new position? \n\n   Yes? \n\n   Therefore, let\'s guess ""SLEPT"".\n\n   Steps: \n     SLEPT: \n        S(1), L(2), E(3), P(4), T(5)\n\n   We hope for greens? \n\n   So: <guess>slept</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, A, N absent; E present but not in position 5), the new guess must:\n- Include the letter E (confirmed in the word)\n- Avoid C, R, A, N (absent letters)\n- Position E somewhere other than the 5th position to test new locations\n- Prioritize common, untested letters (e.g., S, L, P, T) to maximize information\n\nThe word ""SLEPT"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains E in position 3 (testing a new location: 1st–4th positions are possible)\n- Uses untested common letters: S, L, P, T\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N)\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities\n\n<guess>slept</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) E(-) P(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""slept"" -> S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)\nMeaning: S, L, P are absent. E is present but not in position 3 (since we put it at position 3 and got \'-\'). T is present but not in position 5 (because we put T at position 5 and got \'-\').\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P\nPresent letters: E (but not at position 3 or 5), T (but not at position 5)\n\nWe also know that E is not at position 5 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). So E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, T is present but not at position 5, so T must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Must include E and T (since they are present)\n- Must avoid the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P\n- We should try to position E in one of the possible positions (1,2,4) and T in one of the possible positions (1,2,3,4) to get more information.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to maximize information.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 7 absent (C,R,A,N,S,L,P) and minus the 2 present (E,T) that we know? But note: we don\'t know if there are more letters? We have to use only the remaining letters.\n\nTotal absent: C, R, A, N, S, L, P -> 7 letters.\nPresent: E, T -> 2 letters.\n\nBut the word has 5 letters, so we need 3 more letters that are not absent and not E or T? But E and T are already present, so they can be used again? However, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can use E and T again? But we are not forced to? Actually, we must include E and T at least once? But we can include them multiple times? But that might not be efficient? \n\nBut note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters? However, since we are trying to get information, it\'s better to use distinct letters? \n\nSo, we have 26 - 7 = 19 letters available? But we have already used E and T? But they are available to use? The absent letters are the ones we cannot use. So available letters: all letters except C,R,A,N,S,L,P. That is: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and also E and T? \n\nBut E and T are present? So we can use them? \n\nSo the available set: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a word that has E and T? And we have to use three more letters from the above? \n\nWe also have constraints on the positions of E and T.\n\nPossible positions for E: 1,2,4 (since not 3 or 5)\nPossible positions for T: 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)\n\nWe can try to put E and T in positions that we haven\'t tried? \n\nFor example, we haven\'t tried E at position 1 or 2 or 4? And T at position 1,2,3,4? \n\nBut note: we have tried T at position 5? And we know it\'s not at 5? \n\nWe haven\'t tried T at positions 1,2,3,4? \n\nSimilarly, we tried E at position 3 and 5? So we haven\'t tried 1,2,4? \n\nWe can try to put E at position 1 and T at position 2? Or E at 2 and T at 1? Etc.\n\nBut we also need to choose the other letters? \n\nWe want to maximize information? So we should choose common letters that we haven\'t tried? \n\nCommon letters from the available set: \n   Vowels: I, O, U? (we haven\'t tested any of these? We tested A and E? A is absent, E is present? So we need to test I, O, U? \n   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, etc.\n\nWe can try to include a vowel? \n\nLet me try to form words that have E and T and one of I, O, U? \n\nAlso, we have to avoid the absent letters? \n\nOption: E at position 1? \n   Then the word starts with E? \n   Then we need T in one of 2,3,4? \n   Example: \n        E _ _ _ _ \n        We can put T at position 2: E T _ _ _ \n        Then we need three more letters? \n        Words: ""ETHIC"" -> but H is available? But C is absent? Cannot use C? \n        ""ETHYL"": E, T, H, Y, L -> but L is absent? Cannot use L? \n        ""ETUDE"": E, T, U, D, E -> has E twice? And U? \n            But E at position 1 and 5? But we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5? Because the secret word doesn\'t have E at 5? \n            So we must avoid putting E at 5? \n            Therefore, ""ETUDE"" is invalid because it has E at 5? \n        ""ETUIS"": E, T, U, I, S -> but S is absent? \n        ""ETWAS"": not a word? \n\n   How about E at 1 and T at 3? \n        E _ T _ _ \n        Words: ""EATEN"" -> A and N absent? \n        ""EJECT"" -> C and J? C absent? \n        ""EMPTY"" -> M, P, T, Y? But P is absent? \n        ""ENTER"" -> E, N, T, E, R -> N and R absent? \n        ""EIGHT"" -> E, I, G, H, T -> T at position 5? But we are putting T at 3? \n            Actually, ""EIGHT"": E(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) -> T at 5? But we want T at 3? \n        How about ""EIGHT"" doesn\'t fit? \n\n   How about E at 1 and T at 4? \n        E _ _ T _ \n        Words: ""EJECT"" -> C absent? \n        ""EXIST"" -> X, I, S, T -> S absent? \n        ""ELATE"" -> L and A absent? \n        ""EVENT"" -> V, E, N, T -> N absent? \n\n   This is difficult? \n\nOption: E at position 2? \n   Then: _ E _ _ _ \n   And we can put T at position 1: T E _ _ _ \n        Words: ""TEETH"" -> T, E, E, T, H -> double E and double T? \n        ""TEACH"" -> A and C absent? \n        ""TEASE"" -> A and S absent? \n        ""TEMPT"" -> M, P, T -> P absent? \n        ""TENET"" -> N absent? \n        ""TERRY"" -> R absent? \n        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? \n        ""TEPID"" -> T, E, P, I, D -> P absent? \n\n   How about T at position 3: _ E T _ _ \n        Words: ""BETTY"" -> B, E, T, T, Y -> double T? \n        ""JETTY"" -> J, E, T, T, Y -> double T? \n        ""METRO"" -> M, E, T, R, O -> R absent? \n        ""VETCH"" -> V, E, T, C, H -> C absent? \n\n   How about T at position 4: _ E _ T _ \n        Words: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> we already considered? But D is available? \n            But we haven\'t tried D? \n            ""DEITY"": D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is at position 4? \n            However, we know T is present and not at position 5? But we don\'t know about position 4? \n            Also, E is at position 2? \n            This word uses D, I, Y? \n            And avoids absent letters? \n            So ""DEITY"" is a valid word? \n\n        But wait: in the second guess, we tried ""slept"" and got T(-) at position 5? So T is present but not at 5? \n        In ""DEITY"", we put T at position 4? If T is at position 4 in the secret word, we get green? Otherwise, we get amber? \n\n        Also, E is at position 2? We haven\'t tried E at 2? \n\n        So ""DEITY"" seems good? \n\n        But we haven\'t tried D, I, Y? \n\n        However, we must check: are there any other constraints? \n\n        Also, note: we are putting T at position 4? And E at position 2? \n\n        This word is valid? \n\n        But we must make sure that we are not using any absent letters? D, E, I, T, Y -> all are not in the absent list? \n\n        Absent: C,R,A,N,S,L,P -> so D, I, T, E, Y are okay? \n\n        So ""DEITY"" is a candidate? \n\nOption: E at position 4? \n   Then: _ _ _ E _ \n   And we can put T at position 1: T _ _ E _ \n        Words: ""TUNED"" -> T, U, N, E, D -> N absent? \n        ""TYPED"" -> T, Y, P, E, D -> P absent? \n        ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> M and D? \n            But we haven\'t tried M and D? \n            ""TIMED"": T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5) -> avoids absent? \n            But we know T is present and not at 5? Here T is at 1? \n            E is at 4? \n            This word tests T, I, M, E, D? \n\n        So ""TIMED"" is a candidate? \n\n   Or T at position 2: _ T _ E _ \n        Words: ""UTTER"" -> U, T, T, E, R -> R absent? \n        ""OTTER"" -> O, T, T, E, R -> R absent? \n        ""ITHER"" -> I, T, H, E, R -> R absent? \n        ""ATEES"" -> A absent? \n\n   Or T at position 3: _ _ T E _ \n        Words: ""OFTEN"" -> O, F, T, E, N -> N absent? \n        ""OCTET"" -> O, C, T, E, T -> C absent? \n        ""UNTIE"" -> U, N, T, I, E -> N absent? \n        ""UNTIL"" -> N and L absent? \n\n   Or T at position 4: but we have E at 4? So we cannot put T at 4? \n\nSo we have two strong candidates: \n   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)\n   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T(1), I(2), M(3), E(4), D(5)\n\nBut note: in ""DEITY"", we are putting T at position 4? And in ""TIMED"", we are putting T at position 1? \n\nWe know T is present? But we don\'t know its position? \n\nAlso, we are testing E at position 2 in ""DEITY"" and at position 4 in ""TIMED""? \n\nWe haven\'t tried E at position 1? But we don\'t have a candidate with E at 1? \n\nBut we can also consider other words? \n\nAnother candidate: what about E at position 1? \n   We had trouble? \n   How about ""EDIFY"": E, D, I, F, Y -> avoids absent? \n        E(1), D(2), I(3), F(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 1? \n        And we are testing D, I, F, Y? \n        But we are not testing T? We must include T? \n\n   We must include T? Because T is present? \n\n   So we cannot skip T? \n\n   Therefore, we must have both E and T? \n\n   So ""EDIFY"" doesn\'t have T? \n\n   How about ""EDIT"": only 4 letters? \n\n   How about ""TEDDY"": T, E, D, D, Y -> double D? \n        T(1), E(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting E at 2? \n        And T at 1? \n        This word has T and E? \n        But double D? \n        And avoids absent? \n        But we are testing D? \n\n   But we are not sure if the word has double letters? \n\n   However, we can try? \n\n   But ""TEDDY"" is a word? \n\n   But we are testing D? And we don\'t know if D is in the word? \n\n   But we are forced to include T and E? \n\n   So ""TEDDY"" is a candidate? \n\n   But we have ""DEITY"" and ""TIMED"" as well? \n\n   Now, comparing:\n\n   ""DEITY"": \n        E at position 2 (new position for E)\n        T at position 4 (new position for T, since we only tried T at 5)\n        Tests D, I, Y (new letters)\n\n   ""TIMED"":\n        T at position 1 (new for T)\n        E at position 4 (new for E, since we tried E at 3 and 5, but not 4)\n        Tests I, M, D (new letters)\n\n   ""TEDDY"":\n        T at position 1, E at position 2, and D at 3 and 4? \n        But we are testing D? \n        And Y? \n        But double D? \n\n   We might avoid double letters to test more distinct letters? \n\n   So ""TEDDY"" tests only T, E, D, Y? But D is repeated? So we get less information? \n\n   Therefore, I prefer ""DEITY"" or ""TIMED"". \n\n   Now, which one? \n\n   We haven\'t tested M? And we haven\'t tested Y? \n\n   Both are good? \n\n   But note: we know E is present and not at 3 or 5? So positions 1,2,4? \n   We are testing E at 2 in ""DEITY"" and at 4 in ""TIMED""? \n\n   Similarly, T is present and not at 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? \n   In ""DEITY"", T is at 4? In ""TIMED"", T is at 1? \n\n   We might choose based on common positions? \n\n   E is common at position 4?

T at 3? \n            This word tests O and U? \n\n        ""OUTED"" is a candidate? \n\n   So we have a new candidate: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D\n\n   This tests O, U, D? And we have T and E? \n\n   But we are testing two vowels? \n\n   And we are putting E at 4? T at 3? \n\n   Now, comparing:\n\n   Candidate 1: ""DEITY"" -> D, E, I, T, Y -> tests I and Y? \n   Candidate 2: ""TIMED"" -> T, I, M, E, D -> tests I and M? \n   Candidate 3: ""OUTED"" -> O, U, T, E, D -> tests O, U? \n\n   We haven\'t tested I, O, U? \n\n   We might want to test a vowel? \n\n   Since we haven\'t tested any of I, O, U? And we know the word has E? But we don\'t know about other vowels? \n\n   Testing two vowels at once? \n\n   But we have limited guesses? \n\n   Alternatively, we can test one vowel? \n\n   But ""OUTED"" tests two? \n\n   However, it might be efficient? \n\n   Also, we are testing D? \n\n   But we are repeating D? \n\n   Actually, we are testing D? \n\n   Now, which candidate is best? \n\n   We can choose ""OUTED"" because it tests two new vowels? \n\n   But note: we are putting T at position 3? And E at position 4? \n\n   We haven\'t tried T at 3? Or E at 4? \n\n   So it\'s good? \n\n   But we must avoid absent letters? O, U, T, E, D -> all are not in the absent list? \n\n   So ""OUTED"" is valid? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""DEITY"" to test Y? \n\n   But Y is less common? \n\n   I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? \n\n   But let me see: \n        In ""OUTED"", we have:\n            O at 1, U at 2, T at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\n        If we get feedback, we can know about O, U, D? \n\n        And we already know T and E are present? \n\n        Also, if E is at position 4 and it is green? Then we know E is at 4? \n        Similarly, if T is at 3 and green? \n\n        But if they are not, we get amber? \n\n   So I think it\'s good? \n\n   But we have to decide? \n\n   Another candidate: ""MIGHT"" -> but no E? \n\n   We must include E? \n\n   So I think ""OUTED"" is a good choice? \n\n   But wait: we are putting E at position 4? We know E is not at 3 or 5? But we don\'t know about 4? \n   Similarly, T at 3? We don\'t know about 3? \n\n   So we are testing two positions? \n\n   Therefore, I will go with ""OUTED"". \n\n   So the guess is ""OUTED"". \n\n   But let me confirm: \n        O: not tried? \n        U: not tried? \n        T: present, but we are trying at position 3? \n        E: present, at position 4? \n        D: not tried? \n\n   And the word is valid? \n\n   Yes. \n\n   So: <guess>outed</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(absent), N(absent), E(present but wrong position).  \n  This means:  \n  - C, R, A, N are **not in the word**.  \n  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\n- **Guess 2: ""slept""**  \n  Feedback: S(absent), L(absent), E(present but wrong position), P(absent), T(present but wrong position).  \n  This means:  \n  - S, L, P are **not in the word**.  \n  - E is **not in position 3** (since it was guessed there but is present elsewhere).  \n  - T is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters**:  \n   - **E** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  \n   - **T** is present (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, since position 5 is ruled out).\n\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P (cannot be used).  \n3. **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. **Strategy for next guess**:  \n   - Must include **E** and **T** (since they are confirmed present).  \n   - Avoid all absent letters.  \n   - Test **E in a new position** (1, 2, or 4) and **T in a new position** (1, 2, 3, or 4).  \n   - Prioritize untested **vowels (I, O, U)** and common consonants to maximize information.  \n   - Ideal word should test multiple new letters and positions efficiently.\n\n### Chosen Guess: ""OUTED""\n- **Breakdown**:  \n  - O (position 1) → Untested vowel.  \n  - U (position 2) → Untested vowel.  \n  - T (position 3) → Tests T in a new position (previously tried at position 5).  \n  - E (position 4) → Tests E in a new position (previously tried at positions 3 and 5).  \n  - D (position 5) → Untested consonant.  \n\n- **Why this word?**  \n  - Tests **two new vowels (O and U)** and a new consonant **(D)**, while covering E and T.  \n  - Positions 3 and 4 for T and E are untested and common in 5-letter words.  \n  - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct characters for maximum information gain.  \n  - If E or T appear in their guessed positions, we get positional confirmation; if not, we narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>outed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: slept -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) E(-) P(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: outed -> FEEDBACK: O(x) U(x) T(-) E(-) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are now on the fourth guess. Let's recap all feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: slept -> Feedback: S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)
Meaning: S, L, P are absent; E is present but not in position 3; T is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: outed -> Feedback: O(x), U(x), T(-), E(-), D(x)
Meaning: O, U, D are absent; T is present but not in position 3; E is present but not in position 4.

From all feedback, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D (all marked x)
Present letters: E and T (each marked as '-' at least once, so they are in the word but not in the positions guessed)

Additionally, we have positional constraints for E and T:

For E:
- Not in position 5 (from guess 1)
- Not in position 3 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 4 (from guess 3)
Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.

For T:
- Not in position 5 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 3 (from guess 3)
Therefore, T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

However, note that the word has 5 positions, and E and T are both present. We also know that:

- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, and at this point we know E and T are two of them, so we have three more letters to find, which must come from the remaining letters not ruled out.

Total absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D → 10 letters.
The alphabet has 26 letters, so available letters: 26 - 10 = 16, but this includes E and T (which we already know are present) and other letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and also E, T (but we already know they are present? But we can reuse? However, we don't know if duplicates exist? So we must assume we need new letters? But we can use E and T again? Actually, since E and T are already present, we can use them, but we might not need to duplicate? 

But note: we need to form a word with E and T plus three more letters? However, the three more letters must be present? Or we haven't confirmed? So we should choose words that only include E, T and letters that haven't been tested? 

Since we don't know if there are more duplicates, we should avoid repeating E and T unnecessarily? But we have no evidence of duplicates? 

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters? So we have:

- Position 1: Can be E or T or another letter? But E must be in 1 or 2? And T in 1, 2, or 4? 

Possible cases for E and T:

Case 1: E in position 1 → Then T cannot be in position 1? So T must be in 2 or 4? But position 2: we haven't tested T at 2? Position 4: we haven't tested T at 4? 

Case 2: E in position 2 → Then T can be in position 1 (if we haven't tested? Note we haven't tested T at 1) or position 4 (not tested) or position 2? But if E is at position 2, can T be at position 2? No, because one letter per position? So T must be in position 1 or 4? 

Therefore, the possibilities:

- E at 1: then T at 2 or T at 4? 

- E at 2: then T at 1 or T at 4? 

We don't have other options? 

So we have four main cases? 

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies one of these and uses other letters that are not absent? 

The available letters beyond E and T: from the absent list we have 10 absent? So remaining: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must choose three more letters from these? 

But note: we are not forced to use only these? If we use E or T again? But we don't need to? 

So we can form words using E, T and three new letters? 

We should aim to test as many new letters as possible? 

Also, we have vowels and consonants? We haven't tested I? Which is a vowel? But we might need a vowel? 

Since E is already in the word? But the other vowels (A absent, O absent, U absent) so only I and sometimes Y are possible vowels? 

We need to guess a word? 

Let's try to form words:

Case: E at 1, T at 2: 
    Word pattern: E T _ _ _
    Then we need to fill the last three positions? They must be filled with letters from B,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we don't know? 

    Possible words? 
        ""ETHIC"" -> but H? and C? C absent? 
        ""ETHYL"" -> but H,Y,L? L absent? 

        Not possible? 

    How? 
        We need a word? 
        ""ETWIX"" not a word? 
        ""ETMIC"" not a word? 

    This is hard? 

Case: E at 1, T at 4:
    Pattern: E _ _ T _

    We need letters for positions 2,3,5? 

    Example words? 
        ""EMPTY"" -> M,P,T? but P absent? 
        ""EJECT"" -> C absent? 
        ""EGRET"" -> G,R? R absent? 
        ""EVENT"" -> V,E,N? N absent? 
        ""EXIST"" -> X,I,S? S absent? 
        ""ELATE"" -> L,A? absent? 

    What are possible? Letters? 

    Let me think: We need words with E at 1, T at 4? And avoiding absent? 

    How about: 
        ""EGGED"" -> double G? Also D absent? 
        ""EIGHT"" -> E,I,G,H,T -> T at position 5? We need T at position 4? 
        ""EIGHT"" is E(1),I(2),G(3),H(4),T(5) -> T is at 5? But we require T at 4? 

    How about ""EIGHT"" doesn't fit the pattern? 

    Another word: ""EDICT"" -> D,C? absent? 

    Hard? 

Case: E at 2, T at 1:
    Pattern: T E _ _ _
    Example: 
        ""TEETH"" -> E again? And T? And H? 
            T(1), E(2), E(3), T(4), H(5) -> but E at 3? We know E cannot be at 3? So if we guess this, position 3 E would be? But the secret word doesn't have E at 3? But if there are two E's? However, we don't know? 
            But also, in positions 3 and 4? 
        ""TEARY"" -> A,R? absent? 
        ""TEPID"" -> P absent? 
        ""TEMPT"" -> P absent? 
        ""TENET"" -> N absent? 
        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? 

    How about ""TEKNIC""? not 5? 

    How about: ""TEWED"" -> T,E,W,E,D? D absent? 

    Not good? 

Case: E at 2, T at 4:
    Pattern: _ E _ T _
    This might be more promising? 

    Fill positions 1,3,5? 
    Letters: From available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

    We need to form a word? 

    Example: 
        ""BEVTY"" not a word? 
        ""FESTT"" not a word? 
        ""HEIST"" -> but S absent? 
        ""MEANT"" -> A,N? absent? 
        ""QUEST"" -> Q,U,E,S? but U and S absent? 
        ""WEARY"" -> W,E,A,R,Y? A,R absent? 

    How about: 
        ""VEINY"" not a word? 
        ""JETTY"" -> J,E,T,T,Y? T repeated? And T at position 4? 
        ""JETTY"": 
            Position1: J? 
            Position2: E? 
            Position3: T? -> but we put T at position? Position3? But we require T at position4? 
            Actually: ""JETTY"" is J(1),E(2),T(3),T(4),Y(5) -> so T at position3? But we need T at 4? 

    How about ""MINTY""? E missing? 

    Let me try: 
        Position1: must be a letter? 
        Position3: a letter? 
        Position5: a letter? 

    Word: ""BEVAT"" not a word? 

    Perhaps: ""BEGET"" -> B,E,G,E,T? E repeated? and T at 5? 
        B(1), E(2), G(3), E(4), T(5) -> we have E at position 2 and 4? But T at 5? We need T at 4? 
        And position 4 is E? 

    We need T at position 4? 

    How about: ""WEARY"" -> but W,E,A,R,Y: A,R absent? 

    Think of words that fit the pattern: 
        ""_ E _ T _"" 

    With letters not absent? 

    Possibilities: 
        ""BEGOT"" -> O? absent? We know O absent? 
        ""BEGIN"" -> G,I,N? N absent? 
        ""RESET"" -> R,S? absent? 
        ""MEFIT"" -> not a word? 
        ""JEDIT"" -> not a word? 

    After consideration, I found: 
        ""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y? 
            Pattern: H(1), E(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5) -> matches? 
            T is at position 4? 
            E at position 2? 
            And it avoids absent? 
            Letters: H, F, T, E, Y? T present? E present? 
            H, F, Y not ruled out? 

        ""HEFTY"" is a valid word? 

    Alternatively: 
        ""KEENLY"" too long? 
        ""KELTY"" not a word? 
        ""MEATY"" -> A absent? 
        ""VEGUE"" not a word? 

    So ""HEFTY"" is a candidate? 

    We are testing with E at 2 and T at 4? 

    And testing H, F, Y? 

    Therefore, we can use ""HEFTY"". 

    But let me confirm the constraints: 
        E must be at 1 or 2? Here it is at 2? 
        T must be at 1,2,4? Here it is at 4? 
        And avoids absent? 

    Yes? 

    So the guess is ""HEFTY""? 

    But wait: we haven't considered other possibilities? 

    What about E at 1 and T at 2? We couldn't find a word? But maybe there is one? 

    For example: ""ETTHE"" not valid? 

    How about ""ETWEE"" not valid? 

    It's difficult? So ""HEFTY"" seems good? 

    Alternatively, we can test a word that might have I? Since I might be a vowel? 

    For the case E at 2, T at 4: 
        Other word: ""VEINT"" not a word? 
        ""MEINT"" not a word? 

    ""HEIST"" has S? 

    Also, ""FEITH"" not a word? 

    So ""HEFTY"" is a reasonable choice? 

    But let me check if there are other possibilities? 

    Another case: what if the word has duplicates? For example, E at 1 and also an extra E? But we don't know? But it would be marked? 

    However, we are not using duplicates? 

    So I'll go with ""HEFTY"".

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Previous Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, N absent; E present (not position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (slept)**: S, L, P absent; E present (not position 3); T present (not position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (outed)**: O, U, D absent; T present (not position 3); E present (not position 4).

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed absent letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D → Cannot be used.
   - **Confirmed present letters**: E and T.
   - **Positional constraints for E**:
     - Must be in position 1 or 2 (ruled out: 3, 4, 5).
   - **Positional constraints for T**:
     - Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out: 3, 5).
   - **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Must include **E** and **T**.
   - Ensure E and T positions align with constraints:
     - E in position 1 or 2.
     - T in position 1, 2, or 4 (non-conflicting with E).
   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, F, Y).
   - Avoid reusing absent letters and minimize duplication unless necessary.
   - **Pattern Focus**: Explore E in position 2 and T in position 4 (untested positions), filling in other spots with new letters.

4. **Word Selection**:
   - Ideal candidate: **""HEFTY""**.
     - **H** (position 1): Untested.
     - **E** (position 2): Complies with constraints (not positions 3/4/5).
     - **F** (position 3): Untested.
     - **T** (position 4): Complies with constraints (not positions 3/5).
     - **Y** (position 5): Untested.
   - Why ""HEFTY""?
     - Tests four new common letters (H, F, Y + F).
     - Fits positional rules: E at 2, T at 4.
     - Avoids conflicts with absent letters and prior positions.
     - Valid 5-letter English word (meaning: heavy or substantial).

5. **Expected Insights**:
   - Confirm if E is at position 2 and/or T at position 4.
   - Identify presence/absence of H, F, Y.
   - Narrow word possibilities further (e.g., if H, F, Y are green/yellow).

<guess>hefty</guess>",hefty,"We are now on the fourth guess. Let's recap all feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: slept -> Feedback: S(x), L(x), E(-), P(x), T(-)
Meaning: S, L, P are absent; E is present but not in position 3; T is present but not in position 5.

Guess 3: outed -> Feedback: O(x), U(x), T(-), E(-), D(x)
Meaning: O, U, D are absent; T is present but not in position 3; E is present but not in position 4.

From all feedback, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D (all marked x)
Present letters: E and T (each marked as '-' at least once, so they are in the word but not in the positions guessed)

Additionally, we have positional constraints for E and T:

For E:
- Not in position 5 (from guess 1)
- Not in position 3 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 4 (from guess 3)
Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.

For T:
- Not in position 5 (from guess 2)
- Not in position 3 (from guess 3)
Therefore, T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

However, note that the word has 5 positions, and E and T are both present. We also know that:

- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, and at this point we know E and T are two of them, so we have three more letters to find, which must come from the remaining letters not ruled out.

Total absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D → 10 letters.
The alphabet has 26 letters, so available letters: 26 - 10 = 16, but this includes E and T (which we already know are present) and other letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and also E, T (but we already know they are present? But we can reuse? However, we don't know if duplicates exist? So we must assume we need new letters? But we can use E and T again? Actually, since E and T are already present, we can use them, but we might not need to duplicate? 

But note: we need to form a word with E and T plus three more letters? However, the three more letters must be present? Or we haven't confirmed? So we should choose words that only include E, T and letters that haven't been tested? 

Since we don't know if there are more duplicates, we should avoid repeating E and T unnecessarily? But we have no evidence of duplicates? 

Moreover, the word must be 5 letters? So we have:

- Position 1: Can be E or T or another letter? But E must be in 1 or 2? And T in 1, 2, or 4? 

Possible cases for E and T:

Case 1: E in position 1 → Then T cannot be in position 1? So T must be in 2 or 4? But position 2: we haven't tested T at 2? Position 4: we haven't tested T at 4? 

Case 2: E in position 2 → Then T can be in position 1 (if we haven't tested? Note we haven't tested T at 1) or position 4 (not tested) or position 2? But if E is at position 2, can T be at position 2? No, because one letter per position? So T must be in position 1 or 4? 

Therefore, the possibilities:

- E at 1: then T at 2 or T at 4? 

- E at 2: then T at 1 or T at 4? 

We don't have other options? 

So we have four main cases? 

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies one of these and uses other letters that are not absent? 

The available letters beyond E and T: from the absent list we have 10 absent? So remaining: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We must choose three more letters from these? 

But note: we are not forced to use only these? If we use E or T again? But we don't need to? 

So we can form words using E, T and three new letters? 

We should aim to test as many new letters as possible? 

Also, we have vowels and consonants? We haven't tested I? Which is a vowel? But we might need a vowel? 

Since E is already in the word? But the other vowels (A absent, O absent, U absent) so only I and sometimes Y are possible vowels? 

We need to guess a word? 

Let's try to form words:

Case: E at 1, T at 2: 
    Word pattern: E T _ _ _
    Then we need to fill the last three positions? They must be filled with letters from B,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But we don't know? 

    Possible words? 
        ""ETHIC"" -> but H? and C? C absent? 
        ""ETHYL"" -> but H,Y,L? L absent? 

        Not possible? 

    How? 
        We need a word? 
        ""ETWIX"" not a word? 
        ""ETMIC"" not a word? 

    This is hard? 

Case: E at 1, T at 4:
    Pattern: E _ _ T _

    We need letters for positions 2,3,5? 

    Example words? 
        ""EMPTY"" -> M,P,T? but P absent? 
        ""EJECT"" -> C absent? 
        ""EGRET"" -> G,R? R absent? 
        ""EVENT"" -> V,E,N? N absent? 
        ""EXIST"" -> X,I,S? S absent? 
        ""ELATE"" -> L,A? absent? 

    What are possible? Letters? 

    Let me think: We need words with E at 1, T at 4? And avoiding absent? 

    How about: 
        ""EGGED"" -> double G? Also D absent? 
        ""EIGHT"" -> E,I,G,H,T -> T at position 5? We need T at position 4? 
        ""EIGHT"" is E(1),I(2),G(3),H(4),T(5) -> T is at 5? But we require T at 4? 

    How about ""EIGHT"" doesn't fit the pattern? 

    Another word: ""EDICT"" -> D,C? absent? 

    Hard? 

Case: E at 2, T at 1:
    Pattern: T E _ _ _
    Example: 
        ""TEETH"" -> E again? And T? And H? 
            T(1), E(2), E(3), T(4), H(5) -> but E at 3? We know E cannot be at 3? So if we guess this, position 3 E would be? But the secret word doesn't have E at 3? But if there are two E's? However, we don't know? 
            But also, in positions 3 and 4? 
        ""TEARY"" -> A,R? absent? 
        ""TEPID"" -> P absent? 
        ""TEMPT"" -> P absent? 
        ""TENET"" -> N absent? 
        ""TESTY"" -> S absent? 

    How about ""TEKNIC""? not 5? 

    How about: ""TEWED"" -> T,E,W,E,D? D absent? 

    Not good? 

Case: E at 2, T at 4:
    Pattern: _ E _ T _
    This might be more promising? 

    Fill positions 1,3,5? 
    Letters: From available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

    We need to form a word? 

    Example: 
        ""BEVTY"" not a word? 
        ""FESTT"" not a word? 
        ""HEIST"" -> but S absent? 
        ""MEANT"" -> A,N? absent? 
        ""QUEST"" -> Q,U,E,S? but U and S absent? 
        ""WEARY"" -> W,E,A,R,Y? A,R absent? 

    How about: 
        ""VEINY"" not a word? 
        ""JETTY"" -> J,E,T,T,Y? T repeated? And T at position 4? 
        ""JETTY"": 
            Position1: J? 
            Position2: E? 
            Position3: T? -> but we put T at position? Position3? But we require T at position4? 
            Actually: ""JETTY"" is J(1),E(2),T(3),T(4),Y(5) -> so T at position3? But we need T at 4? 

    How about ""MINTY""? E missing? 

    Let me try: 
        Position1: must be a letter? 
        Position3: a letter? 
        Position5: a letter? 

    Word: ""BEVAT"" not a word? 

    Perhaps: ""BEGET"" -> B,E,G,E,T? E repeated? and T at 5? 
        B(1), E(2), G(3), E(4), T(5) -> we have E at position 2 and 4? But T at 5? We need T at 4? 
        And position 4 is E? 

    We need T at position 4? 

    How about: ""WEARY"" -> but W,E,A,R,Y: A,R absent? 

    Think of words that fit the pattern: 
        ""_ E _ T _"" 

    With letters not absent? 

    Possibilities: 
        ""BEGOT"" -> O? absent? We know O absent? 
        ""BEGIN"" -> G,I,N? N absent? 
        ""RESET"" -> R,S? absent? 
        ""MEFIT"" -> not a word? 
        ""JEDIT"" -> not a word? 

    After consideration, I found: 
        ""HEFTY"" -> H, E, F, T, Y? 
            Pattern: H(1), E(2), F(3), T(4), Y(5) -> matches? 
            T is at position 4? 
            E at position 2? 
            And it avoids absent? 
            Letters: H, F, T, E, Y? T present? E present? 
            H, F, Y not ruled out? 

        ""HEFTY"" is a valid word? 

    Alternatively: 
        ""KEENLY"" too long? 
        ""KELTY"" not a word? 
        ""MEATY"" -> A absent? 
        ""VEGUE"" not a word? 

    So ""HEFTY"" is a candidate? 

    We are testing with E at 2 and T at 4? 

    And testing H, F, Y? 

    Therefore, we can use ""HEFTY"". 

    But let me confirm the constraints: 
        E must be at 1 or 2? Here it is at 2? 
        T must be at 1,2,4? Here it is at 4? 
        And avoids absent? 

    Yes? 

    So the guess is ""HEFTY""? 

    But wait: we haven't considered other possibilities? 

    What about E at 1 and T at 2? We couldn't find a word? But maybe there is one? 

    For example: ""ETTHE"" not valid? 

    How about ""ETWEE"" not valid? 

    It's difficult? So ""HEFTY"" seems good? 

    Alternatively, we can test a word that might have I? Since I might be a vowel? 

    For the case E at 2, T at 4: 
        Other word: ""VEINT"" not a word? 
        ""MEINT"" not a word? 

    ""HEIST"" has S? 

    Also, ""FEITH"" not a word? 

    So ""HEFTY"" is a reasonable choice? 

    But let me check if there are other possibilities? 

    Another case: what if the word has duplicates? For example, E at 1 and also an extra E? But we don't know? But it would be marked? 

    However, we are not using duplicates? 

    So I'll go with ""HEFTY"". 

    Guess: <guess>hefty</guess>### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Previous Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, N absent; E present (not position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (slept)**: S, L, P absent; E present (not position 3); T present (not position 5).
   - **Guess 3 (outed)**: O, U, D absent; T present (not position 3); E present (not position 4).

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Confirmed absent letters (10 total)**: C, R, A, N, S, L, P, O, U, D → Cannot be used.
   - **Confirmed present letters**: E and T.
   - **Positional constraints for E**:
     - Must be in position 1 or 2 (ruled out: 3, 4, 5).
   - **Positional constraints for T**:
     - Must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out: 3, 5).
   - **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

3. **Strategy for Guess 4**:
   - Must include **E** and **T**.
   - Ensure E and T positions align with constraints:
     - E in position 1 or 2.
     - T in position 1, 2, or 4 (non-conflicting with E).
   - Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, F, Y).
   - Avoid reusing absent letters and minimize duplication unless necessary.
   - **Pattern Focus**: Explore E in position 2 and T in position 4 (untested positions), filling in other spots with new letters.

4. **Word Selection**:
   - Ideal candidate: **""HEFTY""**.
     - **H** (position 1): Untested.
     - **E** (position 2): Complies with constraints (not positions 3/4/5).
     - **F** (position 3): Untested.
     - **T** (position 4): Complies with constraints (not positions 3/5).
     - **Y** (position 5): Untested.
   - Why ""HEFTY""?
     - Tests four new common letters (H, F, Y + F).
     - Fits positional rules: E at 2, T at 4.
     - Avoids conflicts with absent letters and prior positions.
     - Valid 5-letter English word (meaning: heavy or substantial).

5. **Expected Insights**:
   - Confirm if E is at position 2 and/or T at position 4.
   - Identify presence/absence of H, F, Y.
   - Narrow word possibilities further (e.g., if H, F, Y are green/yellow).",Guess 4: hefty -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) F(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
