We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes R and E (at different positions) and also tests other common consonants and vowels.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also introduces new letters.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's? 

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.

<guess>roles</guess>",roles,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's?

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.",Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes R and E (at different positions) and also tests other common consonants and vowels.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also introduces new letters.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's? 

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.

It also introduces S, T, W.\n\n But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at 2.\n\n However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.\n\n Example: ""ERUPT"": \n   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Example: ""EGRET"": \n   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don\'t know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.\n\n But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven\'t tested G and T.\n\n However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s.\n\n Another: ""EXERT"": \n   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.\n\n But X is not very common.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don\'t have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. \n   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E\'s? \n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.\n\n After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: \n   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. \n   We haven\'t tried S, T, W before.\n\n But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That\'s okay because we are confirming their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? Both are valid.\n\n Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.\n\n Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N.\n\n So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but it will give us information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.\n\n Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don\'t want duplicates.\n\n How about ""SERUM"": \n   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven\'t tested U and M. \n   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). \n   Also, avoids A, C, N.\n\n But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.\n\n However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.\n\n I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STREW"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven\'t tested that. \n\n However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That\'s what ""ROLES"" does.\n\n ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.\n\n But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). \n In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).\n\n So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.\n\n Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.\n Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.\n\n Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven\'t tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.\n\n I think both are reasonable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it\'s less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.\n\n Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.\n\n How about ""TROPE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:\n - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tried, and it\'s not 5)\n - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROLES"".\n\n But let me confirm: \n   R at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.\n\n We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.\n\n So, the word is ""ROLES"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is fine.\n\n Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).\n\nThe word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:\n- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it\'s not position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C, A, and N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   Meaning:
      - C, A, N are not in the word.
      - R is in the word but not in position 2.
      - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
   Meaning:
      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).
      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).
      - L is not in the word (new information).
      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.
      - S is not in the word.

So, we now know:

- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.
- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).

Since E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _

We also know:
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don't know where.

Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.

We have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.
- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.

Moreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).

We can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.

But note: we are limited by the letters we haven't tried. We have not tried many other letters.

Common letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don't know. Similarly for O.

Since we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.

Given constraints, let's build a word:

- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _
- We must include R and O, and we can't use C, A, N, L, S.
- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

Since E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.

We know two of them must be R and O, but we don't know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).

But note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.

Also, R must be at 3 or 5.

We can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.

Idea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.

Then we have: O _ R E _

Now we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are present.

Positions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.

Another: ""OORED""? -> not a word.

Another: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.

""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).

""OMPRE"": not a word.

This seems hard.

Idea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.

Then: O _ _ E R

Now we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.

Example: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.

""OILER"": but L is banned.

""OUNCE"": C not allowed.

""OOPRE"": not a word.

This is also difficult.

Idea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.

Then: _ _ O E R

Now positions 1 and 2 need filling.

Example: ""TONER"": 
   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.

""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.

But wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

So ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.

But the idea is: _ _ O E R

Possible words: 
- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.

Another: ""POWER"": 
   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn't at position 2.

The word ""POWER"" breaks down as:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.

Therefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.

In our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: 
  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So: _ _ O E R

What words fit? 
- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.

""JOGER""? not common.

Or ""VOTER"": 
   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.

How about ""HOYER""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.

Then: _ _ R E O

So the word ends with R E O.

But note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.

Is there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.

""TAREO""? A not allowed.

This is difficult.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.

Then: _ _ R E O

Words: 
- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.
- ""THREO"": not a word.

Another: ""TREFO""? not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _

Now we need position 2 and 5.

We remember that we haven't tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word: O ? R E ?

Examples with common letters:
- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.
- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.
- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.

Wait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: 
  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.

Also, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

Similarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It's not common but might be accepted.

""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.

Another: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.

How about ""OTHER"": 
   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? 
   So R is at position 5? That's allowed. 
   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? 
   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.

We know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.

The word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let's write:

Position 1: O
Position 2: T
Position 3: H
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We have:
- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).
- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).
- E at position 4: confirmed.
- T and H are new letters.

Does it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.

So ""OTHER"" is a candidate.

But note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.

Also, we are testing T and H.

Another possibility: ""OPTER"": 
   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

Yes, that's another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.

But ""OTHER"" is more common.

But let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".

We can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R

We have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.

Example: ""MANOR""? 
   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.

""ERROR""? 
   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.

We need E only at 4.

How about ""FUTOR""? not a word.

Then ""OTHER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.

Or ""OFFER""? 
   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This has duplicate F? And we don't know? But it's a valid word. 
   But duplicate F? We are testing F.

But ""OTHER"" is probably more common.

We can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3.

In ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it's hard without knowing O's position.

We are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that's good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don't know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.

But we want to test multiple possibilities.

Another candidate: ""ROUGE"": 
   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? 
   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won't work because E is at 5.

Why not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.

We are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

So for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it's fixed to five positions.

Thus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.

Therefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot use words that don't have E at 4.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: 
   Position 1: O
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: H
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

So that is acceptable.

Even better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.

If the feedback says:
- O at position 1: if it's in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it's present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don't know until we guess.

Similarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOXER""? 
   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that's not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it's present but not at 2? But that's expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: 
   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn't give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.

So it's better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it's not there? And similarly for R, we know it's not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it's not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it's not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.

Also, we haven't used T or H before.

Therefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.

We can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.

So I will go with ""OTHER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - O is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L and S are not in the word.
  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).
- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.

### Strategy for the New Guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.
- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn't at position 2).
  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn't at positions 1 or 2).
  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).
  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).
  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.

This word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.

<guess>other</guess>",other,"We are given the feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   Meaning:
      - C, A, N are not in the word.
      - R is in the word but not in position 2.
      - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
   Meaning:
      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).
      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).
      - L is not in the word (new information).
      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.
      - S is not in the word.

So, we now know:

- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.
- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).

Since E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _

We also know:
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don't know where.

Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.

We have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.
- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.

Moreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).

We can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.

But note: we are limited by the letters we haven't tried. We have not tried many other letters.

Common letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don't know. Similarly for O.

Since we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.

Given constraints, let's build a word:

- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _
- We must include R and O, and we can't use C, A, N, L, S.
- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

Since E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.

We know two of them must be R and O, but we don't know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).

But note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.

Also, R must be at 3 or 5.

We can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.

Idea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.

Then we have: O _ R E _

Now we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are present.

Positions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.

Another: ""OORED""? -> not a word.

Another: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.

""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).

""OMPRE"": not a word.

This seems hard.

Idea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.

Then: O _ _ E R

Now we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.

Example: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.

""OILER"": but L is banned.

""OUNCE"": C not allowed.

""OOPRE"": not a word.

This is also difficult.

Idea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.

Then: _ _ O E R

Now positions 1 and 2 need filling.

Example: ""TONER"": 
   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.

""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.

But wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

So ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.

But the idea is: _ _ O E R

Possible words: 
- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.

Another: ""POWER"": 
   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn't at position 2.

The word ""POWER"" breaks down as:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.

Therefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.

In our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: 
  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So: _ _ O E R

What words fit? 
- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.

""JOGER""? not common.

Or ""VOTER"": 
   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.

How about ""HOYER""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.

Then: _ _ R E O

So the word ends with R E O.

But note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.

Is there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.

""TAREO""? A not allowed.

This is difficult.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.

Then: _ _ R E O

Words: 
- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.
- ""THREO"": not a word.

Another: ""TREFO""? not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _

Now we need position 2 and 5.

We remember that we haven't tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word: O ? R E ?

Examples with common letters:
- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.
- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.
- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.

Wait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: 
  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.

Also, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

Similarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It's not common but might be accepted.

""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.

Another: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.

How about ""OTHER"": 
   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? 
   So R is at position 5? That's allowed. 
   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? 
   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.

We know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.

The word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let's write:

Position 1: O
Position 2: T
Position 3: H
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We have:
- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).
- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).
- E at position 4: confirmed.
- T and H are new letters.

Does it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.

So ""OTHER"" is a candidate.

But note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.

Also, we are testing T and H.

Another possibility: ""OPTER"": 
   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

Yes, that's another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.

But ""OTHER"" is more common.

But let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".

We can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R

We have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.

Example: ""MANOR""? 
   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.

""ERROR""? 
   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.

We need E only at 4.

How about ""FUTOR""? not a word.

Then ""OTHER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.

Or ""OFFER""? 
   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This has duplicate F? And we don't know? But it's a valid word. 
   But duplicate F? We are testing F.

But ""OTHER"" is probably more common.

We can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3.

In ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it's hard without knowing O's position.

We are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that's good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don't know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.

But we want to test multiple possibilities.

Another candidate: ""ROUGE"": 
   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? 
   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won't work because E is at 5.

Why not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.

We are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

So for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it's fixed to five positions.

Thus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.

Therefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot use words that don't have E at 4.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: 
   Position 1: O
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: H
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

So that is acceptable.

Even better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.

If the feedback says:
- O at position 1: if it's in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it's present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don't know until we guess.

Similarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOXER""? 
   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that's not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it's present but not at 2? But that's expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: 
   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn't give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.

So it's better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it's not there? And similarly for R, we know it's not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it's not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it's not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.

Also, we haven't used T or H before.

Therefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.

We can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.

So I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - O is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L and S are not in the word.
  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).
- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.

### Strategy for the New Guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.
- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn't at position 2).
  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn't at positions 1 or 2).
  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).
  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).
  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.

This word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.",Guess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,odder,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes R and E (at different positions) and also tests other common consonants and vowels.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also introduces new letters.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's? 

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   Meaning:
      - C, A, N are not in the word.
      - R is in the word but not in position 2.
      - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
   Meaning:
      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).
      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).
      - L is not in the word (new information).
      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.
      - S is not in the word.

So, we now know:

- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.
- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).

Since E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _

We also know:
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don't know where.

Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.

We have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.
- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.

Moreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).

We can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.

But note: we are limited by the letters we haven't tried. We have not tried many other letters.

Common letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don't know. Similarly for O.

Since we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.

Given constraints, let's build a word:

- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _
- We must include R and O, and we can't use C, A, N, L, S.
- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

Since E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.

We know two of them must be R and O, but we don't know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).

But note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.

Also, R must be at 3 or 5.

We can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.

Idea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.

Then we have: O _ R E _

Now we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are present.

Positions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.

Another: ""OORED""? -> not a word.

Another: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.

""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).

""OMPRE"": not a word.

This seems hard.

Idea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.

Then: O _ _ E R

Now we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.

Example: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.

""OILER"": but L is banned.

""OUNCE"": C not allowed.

""OOPRE"": not a word.

This is also difficult.

Idea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.

Then: _ _ O E R

Now positions 1 and 2 need filling.

Example: ""TONER"": 
   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.

""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.

But wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

So ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.

But the idea is: _ _ O E R

Possible words: 
- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.

Another: ""POWER"": 
   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn't at position 2.

The word ""POWER"" breaks down as:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.

Therefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.

In our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: 
  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So: _ _ O E R

What words fit? 
- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.

""JOGER""? not common.

Or ""VOTER"": 
   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.

How about ""HOYER""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.

Then: _ _ R E O

So the word ends with R E O.

But note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.

Is there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.

""TAREO""? A not allowed.

This is difficult.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.

Then: _ _ R E O

Words: 
- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.
- ""THREO"": not a word.

Another: ""TREFO""? not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _

Now we need position 2 and 5.

We remember that we haven't tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word: O ? R E ?

Examples with common letters:
- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.
- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.
- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.

Wait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: 
  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.

Also, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

Similarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It's not common but might be accepted.

""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.

Another: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.

How about ""OTHER"": 
   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? 
   So R is at position 5? That's allowed. 
   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? 
   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.

We know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.

The word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let's write:

Position 1: O
Position 2: T
Position 3: H
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We have:
- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).
- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).
- E at position 4: confirmed.
- T and H are new letters.

Does it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.

So ""OTHER"" is a candidate.

But note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.

Also, we are testing T and H.

Another possibility: ""OPTER"": 
   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

Yes, that's another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.

But ""OTHER"" is more common.

But let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".

We can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R

We have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.

Example: ""MANOR""? 
   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.

""ERROR""? 
   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.

We need E only at 4.

How about ""FUTOR""? not a word.

Then ""OTHER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.

Or ""OFFER""? 
   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This has duplicate F? And we don't know? But it's a valid word. 
   But duplicate F? We are testing F.

But ""OTHER"" is probably more common.

We can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3.

In ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it's hard without knowing O's position.

We are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that's good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don't know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.

But we want to test multiple possibilities.

Another candidate: ""ROUGE"": 
   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? 
   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won't work because E is at 5.

Why not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.

We are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

So for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it's fixed to five positions.

Thus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.

Therefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot use words that don't have E at 4.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: 
   Position 1: O
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: H
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

So that is acceptable.

Even better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.

If the feedback says:
- O at position 1: if it's in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it's present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don't know until we guess.

Similarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOXER""? 
   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that's not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it's present but not at 2? But that's expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: 
   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn't give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.

So it's better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it's not there? And similarly for R, we know it's not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it's not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it's not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.

Also, we haven't used T or H before.

Therefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.

We can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.

So I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - O is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L and S are not in the word.
  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).
- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.

### Strategy for the New Guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.
- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn't at position 2).
  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn't at positions 1 or 2).
  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).
  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).
  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.

This word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.

But we haven\'t tested S, T, P.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).\n\n But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.\n\n Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? \n Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? \n   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.\n\n So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.\n\n How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.\n\n Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.\n\n Some words:\n - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).\n\n - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don\'t want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Let me avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another: ""STORE"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""STREW"": \n   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.\n\n This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.\n\n But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at 2.\n\n However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.\n\n Example: ""ERUPT"": \n   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Example: ""EGRET"": \n   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don\'t know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.\n\n But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven\'t tested G and T.\n\n However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s.\n\n Another: ""EXERT"": \n   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.\n\n But X is not very common.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don\'t have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. \n   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E\'s? \n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.\n\n After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: \n   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. \n   We haven\'t tried S, T, W before.\n\n But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That\'s okay because we are confirming their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? Both are valid.\n\n Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.\n\n Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N.\n\n So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but it will give us information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.\n\n Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don\'t want duplicates.\n\n How about ""SERUM"": \n   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven\'t tested U and M. \n   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). \n   Also, avoids A, C, N.\n\n But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.\n\n However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.\n\n I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STREW"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven\'t tested that. \n\n However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That\'s what ""ROLES"" does.\n\n ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.\n\n But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). \n In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).\n\n So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.\n\n Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.\n Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.\n\n Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven\'t tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.\n\n I think both are reasonable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it\'s less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.\n\n Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.\n\n How about ""TROPE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:\n - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tried, and it\'s not 5)\n - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROLES"".\n\n But let me confirm: \n   R at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.\n\n We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.\n\n So, the word is ""ROLES"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is fine.\n\n Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).\n\nThe word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:\n- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it\'s not position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C, A, and N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n   Meaning:\n      - C, A, N are not in the word.\n      - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n      - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n   Meaning:\n      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).\n      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).\n      - L is not in the word (new information).\n      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.\n      - S is not in the word.\n\nSo, we now know:\n\n- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.\n- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).\n- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).\n\nSince E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also know:\n- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don\'t know where.\n\nAdditionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.\n\nWe have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Has E at position 4.\n- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions).\n- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.\n- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.\n\nMoreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.\n\nPossible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).\n\nWe can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the letters we haven\'t tried. We have not tried many other letters.\n\nCommon letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don\'t know. Similarly for O.\n\nSince we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nGiven constraints, let\'s build a word:\n\n- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _\n- We must include R and O, and we can\'t use C, A, N, L, S.\n- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSince E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe know two of them must be R and O, but we don\'t know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).\n\nBut note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.\n\nAlso, R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nWe can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.\n\nIdea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.\n\nThen we have: O _ R E _\n\nNow we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nPositions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.\n- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.\n\nAnother: ""OORED""? -> not a word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.\n\n""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).\n\n""OMPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis seems hard.\n\nIdea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.\n\nThen: O _ _ E R\n\nNow we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.\n\nExample: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.\n\n""OILER"": but L is banned.\n\n""OUNCE"": C not allowed.\n\n""OOPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis is also difficult.\n\nIdea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ O E R\n\nNow positions 1 and 2 need filling.\n\nExample: ""TONER"": \n   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.\n\n""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.\n\nBut wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\nSo ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.\n\nBut the idea is: _ _ O E R\n\nPossible words: \n- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.\n\nAnother: ""POWER"": \n   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn\'t at position 2.\n\nThe word ""POWER"" breaks down as:\n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.\n\nIn our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.\n\nPossible words: \n  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nSo: _ _ O E R\n\nWhat words fit? \n- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.\n\n""JOGER""? not common.\n\nOr ""VOTER"": \n   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.\n\nHow about ""HOYER""? Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nSo the word ends with R E O.\n\nBut note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.\n\nIs there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.\n\n""TAREO""? A not allowed.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nWords: \n- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.\n- ""THREO"": not a word.\n\nAnother: ""TREFO""? not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _\n\nNow we need position 2 and 5.\n\nWe remember that we haven\'t tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nWe need a word: O ? R E ?\n\nExamples with common letters:\n- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.\n- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.\n- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don\'t know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.\n\nWait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: \n  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.\n\nAlso, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It\'s not common but might be accepted.\n\n""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.\n\nHow about ""OTHER"": \n   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? \n   So R is at position 5? That\'s allowed. \n   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? \n   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.\n\nWe know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.\n\nThe word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let\'s write:\n\nPosition 1: O\nPosition 2: T\nPosition 3: H\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nWe have:\n- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).\n- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).\n- E at position 4: confirmed.\n- T and H are new letters.\n\nDoes it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.\n\nSo ""OTHER"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.\n\nAlso, we are testing T and H.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OPTER"": \n   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nYes, that\'s another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is more common.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".\n\nWe can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R\n\nWe have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nExample: ""MANOR""? \n   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.\n\n""ERROR""? \n   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.\n\nWe need E only at 4.\n\nHow about ""FUTOR""? not a word.\n\nThen ""OTHER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.\n\nOr ""OFFER""? \n   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This has duplicate F? And we don\'t know? But it\'s a valid word. \n   But duplicate F? We are testing F.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is probably more common.\n\nWe can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven\'t tested R at 3.\n\nIn ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it\'s hard without knowing O\'s position.\n\nWe are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that\'s good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don\'t know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.\n\nBut we want to test multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUGE"": \n   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? \n   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won\'t work because E is at 5.\n\nWhy not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.\n\nWe are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nSo for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it\'s fixed to five positions.\n\nThus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.\n\nTherefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use words that don\'t have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: \n   Position 1: O\n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: H\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\nSo that is acceptable.\n\nEven better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.\n\nIf the feedback says:\n- O at position 1: if it\'s in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it\'s present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don\'t know until we guess.\n\nSimilarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOXER""? \n   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that\'s not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn\'t have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it\'s present but not at 2? But that\'s expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: \n   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn\'t give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.\n\nSo it\'s better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it\'s not there? And similarly for R, we know it\'s not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it\'s not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it\'s not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4?

We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":
  O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- O is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a check).
- T is not in the word (x).
- H is not in the word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).
- R is correct and in position 5 (since we placed it at position 5 and got a check).

So, the word is: O _ _ E R

We know the first letter is O, the fourth is E, and the fifth is R.

We also know that the second and third letters are missing and must be filled.

From previous feedback, we know:
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (from the x's in all guesses).
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, T, H (but only O, E, R are in the word).

We need to find two letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not in the banned list and form a valid English word.

Banned letters so far: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

We also know the word contains O, E, R, and two more letters.

The two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned ones.

Common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We need a word of the form: O ? ? E R

We can list possible words:

- ""OAKER"": but A is banned -> invalid.
- ""OATER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R. This avoids banned letters? B and I are not banned. Is ""OBIER"" a word? It might be obscure, but let's check: ""obier"" is not a common word. It might be a surname or not accepted.

- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (comparative of odd). But we have to check if it's valid: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen duplicates so far? But it's possible.

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> duplicate F? And F is not banned. ""Offer"" is a common word.

- ""OILER"": but L is banned -> invalid.

- ""OKIER"": not a word.

- ""OLDER"": L banned -> invalid.

- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B not banned? ""Omber"" is a card game, variant of ombre? Might be accepted.

- ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.

- ""OTHER"": we already tried, and T and H are banned? But we tried ""other"" and got T and H as x, so they are not in the word? But we are looking for a new word.

We need a word that has not been tried? But we are making a new guess.

But we know T and H are not in the word? So we cannot use them.

So, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.

Possible common words:

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it's a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? So it's possible.

- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, in ""order"", R is at position 2 and 5? But we know from previous that R cannot be at position 2? Because in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 and it was minus? So the secret word has R but not at position 2? So if we have a word with R at position 2, that would be incorrect? But if the word has two R's? Then one at position 2 might be possible? But we don't know.

But in ""other"", we have R at position 5 and it was correct? So the secret word has R at position 5? So it cannot have R at position 2? Because that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates exist? So it's risky.

But let's see: from ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? That means that either the secret word has R but not at position 2? Or it has R at position 2 but we got minus? No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R's, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2? So we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we know it's not there? So ""ORDER"" would have R at 2? Which we know is not correct? So it would be a waste? But we are trying to find the word? So we should not use ""ORDER"" because it has R at 2? Which is known to be wrong.

Therefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.

Similarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don't know if F is in the word? So we can try.

But we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can't rule it out.

But to be safe, let's look for words without duplicates.

Possible words without duplicates:

- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.
- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.

So the word must be O ?? ER.

We can think of common words:

- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.
- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.
- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.

We need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.

Common words:
- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)
- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.
- ""OATER"": A banned.
- ""OBIER"": as above.
- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.
- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.
- ""OGEED"": not a word? 
- ""OILER"": L banned.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.
- ""OLDER"": L banned.
- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It's a card game. But we can consider.
- ""ONCER"": N banned.
- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it's wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.

Similarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.

""OTHER"" we already tried.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.

""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.

""OVERT"": as above, doesn't fit.

""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.

""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.

""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven't banned Z? But let's see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.

So, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".

But ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it's a valid word.

Another possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.

We need O at the beginning.

""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let's search for more.

""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.

Another: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OUBIT""? not.

I think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don't know? But we can try.

But we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.

F is not banned? So it's allowed.

Similarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.

Or ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""OGEED""? not.

""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.

""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.

""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.

We need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.

So not.

""OILED"": L banned.

I think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".

But ""offer"" is more common.

Another common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.

But let's confirm the structure: O F F E R

- Position 1: O (correct, we know)
- Position 2: F (new)
- Position 3: F (duplicate F)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

We are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.

If the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on F.

But we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.

We can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.

""OWLED"": L banned.

""OARED"": A banned.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.

Another word: ""OUBIT""? not.

""OFLET""? not a word.

""OAKUM""? not.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.

In Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""OFFER"".

But we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don't know.

But we can try.

Alternatively, is there a word with two different letters?

For example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.

""OMMER"": not.

""OUNCE"": invalid.

""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.

""OPERA"": A banned.

""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - A (x): Not in the word.  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.

- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  
  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - L (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.

- **Guess 3: other**  
  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - H (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  
  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: O  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  
- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  
- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  
- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven't ruled out duplicates).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it's in the word and its position(s).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  
  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  

""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.

<guess>offer</guess>",offer,"We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":

- T is not in the word (x).
- H is not in the word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).

So, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.

Possible common words:

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it's a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? So it's possible.

- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed?

No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R's, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2?

Therefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.

Similarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don't know if F is in the word? So we can try.

But we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can't rule it out.

But to be safe, let's look for words without duplicates.

Possible words without duplicates:

- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.
- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.

So the word must be O ?? ER.

We can think of common words:

- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.
- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.
- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.

We need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.

Common words:
- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)
- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.
- ""OATER"": A banned.
- ""OBIER"": as above.
- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.
- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.
- ""OGEED"": not a word? 
- ""OILER"": L banned.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.
- ""OLDER"": L banned.
- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It's a card game. But we can consider.
- ""ONCER"": N banned.
- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it's wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.

Similarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.

""OTHER"" we already tried.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.

""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.

""OVERT"": as above, doesn't fit.

""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.

""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.

""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven't banned Z? But let's see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.

So, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".

But ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it's a valid word.

Another possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.

We need O at the beginning.

""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let's search for more.

""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.

Another: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OUBIT""? not.

I think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don't know? But we can try.

But we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.

F is not banned? So it's allowed.

Similarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.

Or ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""OGEED""? not.

""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.

""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.

""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.

We need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.

So not.

""OILED"": L banned.

I think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".

But ""offer"" is more common.

Another common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.

But let's confirm the structure: O F F E R

- Position 1: O (correct, we know)
- Position 2: F (new)
- Position 3: F (duplicate F)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

We are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.

If the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on F.

But we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.

We can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.

""OWLED"": L banned.

""OARED"": A banned.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.

Another word: ""OUBIT""? not.

""OFLET""? not a word.

""OAKUM""? not.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.

In Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""OFFER"".

But we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don't know.

But we can try.

Alternatively, is there a word with two different letters?

For example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.

""OMMER"": not.

""OUNCE"": invalid.

""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.

""OPERA"": A banned.

""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - A (x): Not in the word.  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.

- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  
  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - L (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.

- **Guess 3: other**  
  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - H (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  
  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: O  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  
- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  
- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  
- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven't ruled out duplicates).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it's in the word and its position(s).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  
  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  

""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.",Guess 4: offer -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes R and E (at different positions) and also tests other common consonants and vowels.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also introduces new letters.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's? 

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   Meaning:
      - C, A, N are not in the word.
      - R is in the word but not in position 2.
      - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
   Meaning:
      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).
      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).
      - L is not in the word (new information).
      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.
      - S is not in the word.

So, we now know:

- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.
- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).

Since E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _

We also know:
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don't know where.

Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.

We have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.
- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.

Moreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).

We can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.

But note: we are limited by the letters we haven't tried. We have not tried many other letters.

Common letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don't know. Similarly for O.

Since we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.

Given constraints, let's build a word:

- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _
- We must include R and O, and we can't use C, A, N, L, S.
- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

Since E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.

We know two of them must be R and O, but we don't know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).

But note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.

Also, R must be at 3 or 5.

We can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.

Idea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.

Then we have: O _ R E _

Now we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are present.

Positions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.

Another: ""OORED""? -> not a word.

Another: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.

""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).

""OMPRE"": not a word.

This seems hard.

Idea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.

Then: O _ _ E R

Now we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.

Example: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.

""OILER"": but L is banned.

""OUNCE"": C not allowed.

""OOPRE"": not a word.

This is also difficult.

Idea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.

Then: _ _ O E R

Now positions 1 and 2 need filling.

Example: ""TONER"": 
   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.

""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.

But wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

So ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.

But the idea is: _ _ O E R

Possible words: 
- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.

Another: ""POWER"": 
   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn't at position 2.

The word ""POWER"" breaks down as:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.

Therefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.

In our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: 
  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So: _ _ O E R

What words fit? 
- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.

""JOGER""? not common.

Or ""VOTER"": 
   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.

How about ""HOYER""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.

Then: _ _ R E O

So the word ends with R E O.

But note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.

Is there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.

""TAREO""? A not allowed.

This is difficult.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.

Then: _ _ R E O

Words: 
- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.
- ""THREO"": not a word.

Another: ""TREFO""? not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _

Now we need position 2 and 5.

We remember that we haven't tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word: O ? R E ?

Examples with common letters:
- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.
- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.
- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.

Wait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: 
  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.

Also, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

Similarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It's not common but might be accepted.

""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.

Another: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.

How about ""OTHER"": 
   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? 
   So R is at position 5? That's allowed. 
   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? 
   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.

We know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.

The word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let's write:

Position 1: O
Position 2: T
Position 3: H
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We have:
- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).
- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).
- E at position 4: confirmed.
- T and H are new letters.

Does it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.

So ""OTHER"" is a candidate.

But note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.

Also, we are testing T and H.

Another possibility: ""OPTER"": 
   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

Yes, that's another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.

But ""OTHER"" is more common.

But let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".

We can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R

We have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.

Example: ""MANOR""? 
   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.

""ERROR""? 
   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.

We need E only at 4.

How about ""FUTOR""? not a word.

Then ""OTHER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.

Or ""OFFER""? 
   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This has duplicate F? And we don't know? But it's a valid word. 
   But duplicate F? We are testing F.

But ""OTHER"" is probably more common.

We can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3.

In ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it's hard without knowing O's position.

We are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that's good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don't know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.

But we want to test multiple possibilities.

Another candidate: ""ROUGE"": 
   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? 
   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won't work because E is at 5.

Why not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.

We are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

So for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it's fixed to five positions.

Thus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.

Therefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot use words that don't have E at 4.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: 
   Position 1: O
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: H
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

So that is acceptable.

Even better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.

If the feedback says:
- O at position 1: if it's in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it's present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don't know until we guess.

Similarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOXER""? 
   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that's not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it's present but not at 2? But that's expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: 
   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn't give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.

So it's better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it's not there? And similarly for R, we know it's not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it's not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it's not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.

Also, we haven't used T or H before.

Therefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.

We can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.

So I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - O is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L and S are not in the word.
  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).
- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.

### Strategy for the New Guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.
- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn't at position 2).
  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn't at positions 1 or 2).
  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).
  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).
  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.

This word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.

<guess>other</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":
  O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- O is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a check).
- T is not in the word (x).
- H is not in the word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).
- R is correct and in position 5 (since we placed it at position 5 and got a check).

So, the word is: O _ _ E R

We know the first letter is O, the fourth is E, and the fifth is R.

We also know that the second and third letters are missing and must be filled.

From previous feedback, we know:
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (from the x's in all guesses).
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, T, H (but only O, E, R are in the word).

We need to find two letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not in the banned list and form a valid English word.

Banned letters so far: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

We also know the word contains O, E, R, and two more letters.

The two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned ones.

Common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We need a word of the form: O ? ? E R

We can list possible words:

- ""OAKER"": but A is banned -> invalid.
- ""OATER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R. This avoids banned letters? B and I are not banned. Is ""OBIER"" a word? It might be obscure, but let's check: ""obier"" is not a common word. It might be a surname or not accepted.

- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (comparative of odd). But we have to check if it's valid: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen duplicates so far? But it's possible.

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> duplicate F? And F is not banned. ""Offer"" is a common word.

- ""OILER"": but L is banned -> invalid.

- ""OKIER"": not a word.

- ""OLDER"": L banned -> invalid.

- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B not banned? ""Omber"" is a card game, variant of ombre? Might be accepted.

- ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.

- ""OTHER"": we already tried, and T and H are banned? But we tried ""other"" and got T and H as x, so they are not in the word? But we are looking for a new word.

We need a word that has not been tried? But we are making a new guess.

But we know T and H are not in the word? So we cannot use them.

So, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.

Possible common words:

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it's a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? So it's possible.

- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, in ""order"", R is at position 2 and 5? But we know from previous that R cannot be at position 2? Because in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 and it was minus? So the secret word has R but not at position 2? So if we have a word with R at position 2, that would be incorrect? But if the word has two R's? Then one at position 2 might be possible? But we don't know.

But in ""other"", we have R at position 5 and it was correct? So the secret word has R at position 5? So it cannot have R at position 2? Because that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates exist? So it's risky.

But let's see: from ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? That means that either the secret word has R but not at position 2? Or it has R at position 2 but we got minus? No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R's, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2? So we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we know it's not there? So ""ORDER"" would have R at 2? Which we know is not correct? So it would be a waste? But we are trying to find the word? So we should not use ""ORDER"" because it has R at 2? Which is known to be wrong.

Therefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.

Similarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don't know if F is in the word? So we can try.

But we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can't rule it out.

But to be safe, let's look for words without duplicates.

Possible words without duplicates:

- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.
- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.

So the word must be O ?? ER.

We can think of common words:

- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.
- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.
- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.

We need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.

Common words:
- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)
- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.
- ""OATER"": A banned.
- ""OBIER"": as above.
- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.
- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.
- ""OGEED"": not a word? 
- ""OILER"": L banned.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.
- ""OLDER"": L banned.
- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It's a card game. But we can consider.
- ""ONCER"": N banned.
- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it's wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.

Similarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.

""OTHER"" we already tried.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.

""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.

""OVERT"": as above, doesn't fit.

""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.

""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.

""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven't banned Z? But let's see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.

So, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".

But ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it's a valid word.

Another possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.

We need O at the beginning.

""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let's search for more.

""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.

Another: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OUBIT""? not.

I think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don't know? But we can try.

But we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.

F is not banned? So it's allowed.

Similarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.

Or ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""OGEED""? not.

""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.

""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.

""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.

We need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.

So not.

""OILED"": L banned.

I think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".

But ""offer"" is more common.

Another common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.

But let's confirm the structure: O F F E R

- Position 1: O (correct, we know)
- Position 2: F (new)
- Position 3: F (duplicate F)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

We are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.

If the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on F.

But we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.

We can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.

""OWLED"": L banned.

""OARED"": A banned.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.

Another word: ""OUBIT""? not.

""OFLET""? not a word.

""OAKUM""? not.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.

In Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""OFFER"".

But we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don't know.

But we can try.

Alternatively, is there a word with two different letters?

For example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.

""OMMER"": not.

""OUNCE"": invalid.

""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.

""OPERA"": A banned.

""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - A (x): Not in the word.  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.

- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  
  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - L (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.

- **Guess 3: other**  
  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - H (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  
  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: O  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  
- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  
- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  
- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven't ruled out duplicates).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it's in the word and its position(s).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  
  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  

""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.

Then we have R _ _ _ _\n   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).\n\n Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.\n\n Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates. But let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\n We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.\n\n So, let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\n How about ""ROUTE""? \n - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn\'t at 2 and we don\'t know about 1)\n - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.\n\n So we need E not at 5.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? \n - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.\n - But we don\'t know if B is in the word? We are testing.\n\n But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.\n\n Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it\'s not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.\n\n Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.\n\n Example: \n - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\n   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.\n\n Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: \n   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven\'t tested S, T, P.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).\n\n But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.\n\n Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? \n Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? \n   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.\n\n So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.\n\n How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.\n\n Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.\n\n Some words:\n - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).\n\n - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don\'t want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Let me avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another: ""STORE"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""STREW"": \n   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.\n\n This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.\n\n But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at 2.\n\n However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.\n\n Example: ""ERUPT"": \n   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Example: ""EGRET"": \n   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don\'t know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.\n\n But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven\'t tested G and T.\n\n However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s.\n\n Another: ""EXERT"": \n   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.\n\n But X is not very common.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don\'t have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. \n   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E\'s? \n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.\n\n After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: \n   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. \n   We haven\'t tried S, T, W before.\n\n But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That\'s okay because we are confirming their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? Both are valid.\n\n Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.\n\n Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N.\n\n So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but it will give us information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.\n\n Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don\'t want duplicates.\n\n How about ""SERUM"": \n   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven\'t tested U and M. \n   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). \n   Also, avoids A, C, N.\n\n But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.\n\n However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.\n\n I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STREW"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven\'t tested that. \n\n However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That\'s what ""ROLES"" does.\n\n ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.\n\n But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). \n In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).\n\n So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.\n\n Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.\n Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.\n\n Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven\'t tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.\n\n I think both are reasonable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it\'s less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.\n\n Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.\n\n How about ""TROPE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:\n - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tried, and it\'s not 5)\n - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROLES"".\n\n But let me confirm: \n   R at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.\n\n We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.\n\n So, the word is ""ROLES"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is fine.\n\n Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).\n\nThe word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:\n- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it\'s not position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C, A, and N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n   Meaning:\n      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).\n      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).\n      - L is not in the word (new information).\n      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.\n      - S is not in the word.\n\nSo, we now know:\n\n- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.\n- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).\n- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).\n\nSince E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also know:\n- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don\'t know where.\n\nAdditionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.\n\nWe have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Has E at position 4.\n- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions).\n- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.\n- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.\n\nMoreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.\n\nPossible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).\n\nWe can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the letters we haven\'t tried. We have not tried many other letters.\n\nCommon letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don\'t know. Similarly for O.\n\nSince we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nGiven constraints, let\'s build a word:\n\n- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _\n- We must include R and O, and we can\'t use C, A, N, L, S.\n- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSince E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe know two of them must be R and O, but we don\'t know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).\n\nBut note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.\n\nAlso, R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nWe can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.\n\nIdea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.\n\nThen we have: O _ R E _\n\nNow we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nPositions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.\n- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.\n\nAnother: ""OORED""? -> not a word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.\n\n""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).\n\n""OMPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis seems hard.\n\nIdea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.\n\nThen: O _ _ E R\n\nNow we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.\n\nExample: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.\n\n""OILER"": but L is banned.\n\n""OUNCE"": C not allowed.\n\n""OOPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis is also difficult.\n\nIdea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ O E R\n\nNow positions 1 and 2 need filling.\n\nExample: ""TONER"": \n   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.\n\n""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.\n\nBut wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\nSo ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.\n\nBut the idea is: _ _ O E R\n\nPossible words: \n- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.\n\nAnother: ""POWER"": \n   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn\'t at position 2.\n\nThe word ""POWER"" breaks down as:\n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.\n\nIn our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.\n\nPossible words: \n  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nSo: _ _ O E R\n\nWhat words fit? \n- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.\n\n""JOGER""? not common.\n\nOr ""VOTER"": \n   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.\n\nHow about ""HOYER""? Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nSo the word ends with R E O.\n\nBut note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.\n\nIs there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.\n\n""TAREO""? A not allowed.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nWords: \n- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.\n- ""THREO"": not a word.\n\nAnother: ""TREFO""? not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _\n\nNow we need position 2 and 5.\n\nWe remember that we haven\'t tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nWe need a word: O ? R E ?\n\nExamples with common letters:\n- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.\n- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.\n- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don\'t know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.\n\nWait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: \n  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.\n\nAlso, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It\'s not common but might be accepted.\n\n""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.\n\nHow about ""OTHER"": \n   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? \n   So R is at position 5? That\'s allowed. \n   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? \n   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.\n\nWe know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.\n\nThe word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let\'s write:\n\nPosition 1: O\nPosition 2: T\nPosition 3: H\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nWe have:\n- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).\n- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).\n- E at position 4: confirmed.\n- T and H are new letters.\n\nDoes it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.\n\nSo ""OTHER"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.\n\nAlso, we are testing T and H.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OPTER"": \n   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nYes, that\'s another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is more common.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".\n\nWe can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R\n\nWe have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nExample: ""MANOR""? \n   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.\n\n""ERROR""? \n   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.\n\nWe need E only at 4.\n\nHow about ""FUTOR""? not a word.\n\nThen ""OTHER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.\n\nOr ""OFFER""? \n   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This has duplicate F? And we don\'t know? But it\'s a valid word. \n   But duplicate F? We are testing F.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is probably more common.\n\nWe can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven\'t tested R at 3.\n\nIn ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it\'s hard without knowing O\'s position.\n\nWe are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that\'s good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don\'t know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.\n\nBut we want to test multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUGE"": \n   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? \n   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won\'t work because E is at 5.\n\nWhy not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.\n\nWe are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nSo for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it\'s fixed to five positions.\n\nThus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.\n\nTherefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use words that don\'t have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: \n   Position 1: O\n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: H\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\nSo that is acceptable.\n\nEven better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.\n\nIf the feedback says:\n- O at position 1: if it\'s in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it\'s present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don\'t know until we guess.\n\nSimilarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOXER""? \n   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that\'s not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn\'t have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it\'s present but not at 2? But that\'s expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: \n   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn\'t give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.\n\nSo it\'s better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it\'s not there? And similarly for R, we know it\'s not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it\'s not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it\'s not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used T or H before.\n\nTherefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.\n\nWe can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.\n\nSo I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  \n  - C, A, and N are not in the word.\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 1.\n  - O is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - L and S are not in the word.\n  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).\n- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.\n- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.\n- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.\n\n### Strategy for the New Guess:\n- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.\n- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn\'t at position 2).\n  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn\'t at positions 1 or 2).\n  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).\n  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).\n  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.\n\nThis word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.\n\n<guess>other</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":\n  O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- O is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a check).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- H is not in the word (x).\n- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).\n- R is correct and in position 5 (since we placed it at position 5 and got a check).\n\nSo, the word is: O _ _ E R\n\nWe know the first letter is O, the fourth is E, and the fifth is R.\n\nWe also know that the second and third letters are missing and must be filled.\n\nFrom previous feedback, we know:\n- The word does not contain: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, T, H (but only O, E, R are in the word).\n\nWe need to find two letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not in the banned list and form a valid English word.\n\nBanned letters so far: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.\n\nWe also know the word contains O, E, R, and two more letters.\n\nThe two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned ones.\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nWe need a word of the form: O ? ? E R\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- ""OAKER"": but A is banned -> invalid.\n- ""OATER"": A banned -> invalid.\n- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R. This avoids banned letters? B and I are not banned. Is ""OBIER"" a word? It might be obscure, but let\'s check: ""obier"" is not a common word. It might be a surname or not accepted.\n\n- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (comparative of odd). But we have to check if it\'s valid: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have two D\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven\'t seen duplicates so far? But it\'s possible.\n\n- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> duplicate F? And F is not banned. ""Offer"" is a common word.\n\n- ""OILER"": but L is banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OKIER"": not a word.\n\n- ""OLDER"": L banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B not banned? ""Omber"" is a card game, variant of ombre? Might be accepted.\n\n- ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OTHER"": we already tried, and T and H are banned? But we tried ""other"" and got T and H as x, so they are not in the word? But we are looking for a new word.\n\nWe need a word that has not been tried? But we are making a new guess.\n\nBut we know T and H are not in the word? So we cannot use them.\n\nSo, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.\n\nPossible common words:\n\n- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it\'s a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don\'t have evidence against duplicates? So it\'s possible.\n\n- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Also, in ""order"", R is at position 2 and 5? But we know from previous that R cannot be at position 2? Because in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 and it was minus? So the secret word has R but not at position 2? So if we have a word with R at position 2, that would be incorrect? But if the word has two R\'s? Then one at position 2 might be possible? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""other"", we have R at position 5 and it was correct? So the secret word has R at position 5? So it cannot have R at position 2? Because that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates exist? So it\'s risky.\n\nBut let\'s see: from ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? That means that either the secret word has R but not at position 2? Or it has R at position 2 but we got minus? No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R\'s, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2? So we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we know it\'s not there? So ""ORDER"" would have R at 2? Which we know is not correct? So it would be a waste? But we are trying to find the word? So we should not use ""ORDER"" because it has R at 2? Which is known to be wrong.\n\nTherefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.\n\nSimilarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don\'t know if F is in the word? So we can try.\n\nBut we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can\'t rule it out.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s look for words without duplicates.\n\nPossible words without duplicates:\n\n- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.\n- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.\n- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.\n- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.\n- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.\n- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.\n\nSo the word must be O ?? ER.\n\nWe can think of common words:\n\n- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.\n- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.\n- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.\n\nWe need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)\n- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.\n- ""OATER"": A banned.\n- ""OBIER"": as above.\n- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.\n- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.\n- ""OGEED"": not a word? \n- ""OILER"": L banned.\n- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.\n- ""OLDER"": L banned.\n- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It\'s a card game. But we can consider.\n- ""ONCER"": N banned.\n- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it\'s wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.\n\n""OTHER"" we already tried.\n\n""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.\n\n""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.\n\n""OVERT"": as above, doesn\'t fit.\n\n""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.\n\n""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.\n\n""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven\'t banned Z? But let\'s see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.\n\nSo, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".\n\nBut ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.\n\nWe need O at the beginning.\n\n""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let\'s search for more.\n\n""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.\n\nAnother: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.\n\nPerhaps ""OUBIT""? not.\n\nI think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don\'t know? But we can try.\n\nBut we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.\n\nF is not banned? So it\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.\n\nOr ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""OGEED""? not.\n\n""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.\n\n""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.\n\nWe need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.\n\nSo not.\n\n""OILED"": L banned.\n\nI think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".\n\nBut ""offer"" is more common.\n\nAnother common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\n""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\n""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the structure: O F F E R\n\n- Position 1: O (correct, we know)\n- Position 2: F (new)\n- Position 3: F (duplicate F)\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R (correct)\n\nWe are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.\n\nIf the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on F.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.\n\n""OWLED"": L banned.\n\n""OARED"": A banned.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.\n\nAnother word: ""OUBIT""? not.\n\n""OFLET""? not a word.\n\n""OAKUM""? not.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.\n\nIn Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""OFFER"".\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nAlternatively, is there a word with two different letters?\n\nFor example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.\n\n""OMMER"": not.\n\n""OUNCE"": invalid.\n\n""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.\n\n""OPERA"": A banned.\n\n""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\n""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  - C (x): Not in the word.  \n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  \n  - A (x): Not in the word.  \n  - N (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  \n  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.\n\n- **Guess 2: roles**  \n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  \n  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  \n  - L (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  \n  - S (x): Not in the word.  \n  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.\n\n- **Guess 3: other**  \n  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - T (x): Not in the word.  \n  - H (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  \n  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - Position 1: O  \n  - Position 4: E  \n  - Position 5: R  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  \n- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  \n- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  \n- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  \n- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  \n- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  \n  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  \n  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven\'t ruled out duplicates).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  \n  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it\'s in the word and its position(s).  \n- **Why not other words?**  \n  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  \n  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  \n  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  \n  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  \n  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  \n\n""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.\n\n<guess>offer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: offer -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from the fourth guess ""offer"":
 O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)

 This means:
 - O at position 1 is correct (already known).
 - F is not in the word at all? Both F's are marked 'x'. So F is not in the word.
 - E at position 4 is correct (known).
 - R at position 5 is correct (known).

 So the word remains: O ? ? E R

 And we now know that F is not in the word.

 Previously, we have banned letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.

 The word must be O followed by two letters, then E and R.

 The two middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 We have not tried: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, and some others.

 We must form a valid English word.

 Common words that fit O ? ? E R:

 - ""OAKER"": not valid (and A is banned).
 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> B and I? Not common, but possible.
 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (meaning more odd). But duplicate.
 - ""OGLER"": but L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a card game variant. Not common, but accepted in word games.
 - ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUBET""? not a word.
 - ""OUNCE"": N banned? and C banned? So invalid.
 - ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 But note: ""offer"" had two F's and both were wrong? So F is entirely banned? So we must avoid F.

 Also, we have not tried D, G, I, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's list possible words without the banned letters:

 - ""OBIER"": O-B-I-E-R -> banned? B and I are allowed? But is it a word? Not in common use.
 - ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OCTET"": C and T banned -> invalid.
 - ""ODDER"": O-D-D-E-R -> duplicates D? But allowed? And D not banned? 
 - ""OPERA"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OTHER"": already tried -> invalid.
 - ""OTTER"": T banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUNCE"": N and C banned -> invalid.

 Another: ""OGEES"": O-G-E-E-S -> but S banned? and duplicate E? Also E at position 3? Not 4. And we need position 4 to be E? So structure is fixed? Must be O ?? E R? So we cannot change the positions of E and R.

 So we need both positions 4 and 5 to be E and R respectively.

 Therefore, the word must be O [letter1] [letter2] E R.

 With banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 So possible letters for position 2 and 3: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z.

 We need a combination that forms a word.

 Common options:
 - ""ORDER"": O-R-D-E-R -> R at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And R at 2 would be duplicate? Also, in ""crane"", R was at 2 and marked minus? So R cannot be at position 2? So invalid? Because position 5 R is already fixed? So we cannot put R at 2? Therefore, no duplicate R? Probably? But we don't know? However, we know R is at 5? And one R? So if the secret word has only one R, then position 2 cannot be R? But if it has two R's? Then R at 2 might be possible? But in ""crane"" we had R at 2 and got minus? So meaning that if there were two R's, having R at 2 might get a minus if one of the R's is at the correct position? It's ambiguous? But to be safe, we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we already know R is not at 2? We should try a word without R in position 2? So ""ORDER"" is not suitable? Because it has R at 2.

 But let's consider: the secret word is O ?? E R? And if it were ""ORDER"", it would be O R D E R? Then:
   Position 1: O (correct)
   Position 2: R (this would be a duplicate? But if we get feedback: R is present but not at position 2? That's what we got in ""crane""? But in ""other"", we got R at position 5 correct? And if the word has two R's? Then position 2 R might still be present? So we could get a minus for R at position 2? But we already know R is present? So it wouldn't tell us nothing new? Moreover, we would get for position 2: minus? Which we already know? So we are wasting a chance to test new letters? Therefore, we should not use ""ORDER"".

 Similarly, avoid words with letters we already tested? We need to test new letters.

 So let's focus on words with two new letters? Like:

 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R? -> B and I? Is it a word? I think ""Oubier"" is a French word? But in English, it might not be accepted? Not common.

 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R? -> This has D twice? And we can test D? If ""ODDER"" is the word? Or we get information about D? But it's a valid word? Meaning ""more odd"".

 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R? -> M and B? We haven't tested M or B? So we get information.

 - ""OPTER"": O P T E R? -> but T is banned? So invalid.

 - ""OUNCE"": invalid.

 - ""OOGER""?: not a word.

 Another: ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 ""OAKUM"": doesn't fit? A banned anyway.

 ""OAVES"": not a word? A banned.

 ""OBITS"": S banned -> invalid.

 ""OGIVE"": O G I V E? but E at position 5? Not 4? In the word, E must be at 4? So ""ogive"" is O-G-I-V-E? -> E at 5? Not allowed? Because E must be at 4? So we cannot use.

 So the options are limited.

 Let's consider ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".

 ""ODDER"": 
   - Uses duplicate D? But D not banned? 
   - We test D? If D is in the word? If it is, we would get:
        Letter D at position 2 and 3? If D is in the word, and duplicated, we might get minuses? But we don't know the positions? Or it could be correct? 

 ""OMBER"": 
   - M and B? New? 

 Which is more common? ""ODDER"" is a valid word? But ""OMBER"" is more obscure? In Wordle, common words are prioritized.

 But we can search for more words:

 We need O??ER 
   Excluding: A,C,N,L,S,T,H,F

 We can try:
   B: can be at position 2 or 3? For example: O B _ E R? 

   Words: ""OBIER"" (if accepted), or with G: O G ? E R? 
   O G E not common? 

   With D: O D _ E R? ""order"" has R? So ""odder""

   With M: O M _ E R? Can be ""omber"" if we allow B? That is: 'omber' -> O M B E R? So positions: O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

   So ""OMBER"" is O M B E R.

   Similarly, O P _ E R? What words?: ""opera"" is O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4? ""OPPER""? not a word? ""OPTER"" has T banned? ""Ouped""? not.

   O U _ E R? ""oufer""? F banned? ""Ouser""? S banned? ""Ouwer""? not a word.

   O K _ E R? ""okker""? not? ""oaker""? A banned.

   O G _ E R? ""ogger""? not? ""ogre"" is 4 letters? 

   So no.

 Therefore, we have:
   ""OBIER"": if allowed? Or ""OMBER"", or ""ODDER"".

 We also have ""OAKER"", but A banned.

 Another: ""OILER"": L banned.

 Perhaps ""OVERT"" doesn't match.

 After consideration, ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

 Also, ""OWE"" variations don't work.

 So among ""ODDER"", ""OMBER"", and ""OBIER"".

 We can try ""OUNCE"" but N banned.

 Another word: ""OAKES"" S banned.

 Perhaps ""OSIER"": L? OSIER is a type of willow? But S and I? And S is banned? So invalid.

 Another: ""OATER"": A banned.

 I think the valid words are:
   - ""ODDER"": valid word? Yes, and no banned letters? O,D,E,R. In ""odder"", the letter D at position 2 and 3? So duplicate D? And E at 4 and R at 5? And O at 1? So it fits? It means more odd? Comparative of odd? Or a person who plows? Archaic? But accepted in dictionaries.

   - ""OMBER"": a card game? Accepted? Might be in the word bank.

   - ""OBIER"": not common? Not in all dictionaries? So less likely.

   - ""ONCER"": N banned.

   - ""OKIER"": not a word? 

 So I think we should choose between ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".

 We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We must try one.

 We have two guesses left? We are on the fifth guess.

 Let's pick ""ODDER"" because it is more common?

 But ""OMBER"" might be just as valid.

 But we can also choose a word that doesn't have duplicates? Then we test two different letters? But we don't have many words.

 Alternatively, we can think of words like ""OPTER""? T banned.

 ""OUTER"": T banned.

 ""OUBER""?: not.

 I think we have to use either ""OMBER"" or ""ODDER"".

 Let's choose ""OMBER"" first? Because it tests two new letters: M and B? Rather than duplicate D.

 But ""ODDER"" tests D? But only one new letter? Because D is replicated? So if D is in the word, it must be duplicated? So we get less information? Whereas ""OMBER"" tests both M and B? So if we get minuses or x for both, we know they are not in the word.

 So ""OMBER"" might be better? It tests M at position 2 and B at position 3? Both new.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""OMBER"".

 But is it in Wordle's word list? We can assume it is? Or use a safer word? Is there a safer word?

 Another: ""OAKUM"" doesn't fit.

 So I think ""OMBER"" is valid.

 We can try ""OPERA""? Not? A banned.

 Or ""OWE""? Not 5 letters.

 So: guess ""OMBER"".

 But in ""OMBER"", we have O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So matches the structure.

 And banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F are avoided.

 So it's a valid guess.

 Therefore, guessed word is ""OMBER"".

 But let's double-check:

 Guess: ""omber""
   If the word is ""omber"", then we get it right? If not, then we get feedback on M and B? Which is useful for the last guess.

 Alternatively, if we try ""odder"", and it's not the word? Then we know D is duplicated? But we don't have D in other letters? So not so useful? Whereas ""omber"" gives info on two distinct letters.

 So better.

### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - Excluded: C, A, N.  
  - R and E are in the word (wrong positions).  
- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - Excluded: L, S.  
  - Confirmed: E is at position 4 (✓).  
  - R is not in position 1, O is not in position 2.  
- **Guess 3: other**  
  - Excluded: T, H.  
  - Confirmed: O is at position 1 (✓), E is at position 4 (✓), R is at position 5 (✓).  
  - **Word structure: O _ _ E R**.  
- **Guess 4: offer**  
  - Excluded: F.  
  - Confirmed: O (✓), E (✓), R (✓) positions remain unchanged.  
  - Feedback for F: Both occurrences are ""x"" → **F is not in the word**.

### Current Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- The goal is to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the allowed pool that form valid English words.  
- Prioritize testing **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., M, B, D) to maximize information.  
- Candidate: **""OMBER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` → O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests M (position 2) and B (position 3), both new and common letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on M and B reveals their presence/absence.  
- Why not other candidates?  
  - ""ODDER"": Uses duplicate D (less informative if D is absent).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon word (low probability).  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known incorrect).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  

<guess>omber</guess>",omber,"We are given the feedback from the fourth guess ""offer"":
 O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)

 This means:
 - O at position 1 is correct (already known).
 - F is not in the word at all? Both F's are marked 'x'. So F is not in the word.
 - E at position 4 is correct (known).
 - R at position 5 is correct (known).

 So the word remains: O ? ? E R

 And we now know that F is not in the word.

 Previously, we have banned letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.

 The word must be O followed by two letters, then E and R.

 The two middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 We have not tried: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, and some others.

 We must form a valid English word.

 Common words that fit O ? ? E R:

 - ""OAKER"": not valid (and A is banned).
 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> B and I? Not common, but possible.
 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (meaning more odd). But duplicate.
 - ""OGLER"": but L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a card game variant. Not common, but accepted in word games.
 - ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUBET""? not a word.
 - ""OUNCE"": N banned? and C banned? So invalid.
 - ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 But note: ""offer"" had two F's and both were wrong? So F is entirely banned? So we must avoid F.

 Also, we have not tried D, G, I, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's list possible words without the banned letters:

 - ""OBIER"": O-B-I-E-R -> banned? B and I are allowed? But is it a word? Not in common use.
 - ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OCTET"": C and T banned -> invalid.
 - ""ODDER"": O-D-D-E-R -> duplicates D? But allowed? And D not banned? 
 - ""OPERA"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OTHER"": already tried -> invalid.
 - ""OTTER"": T banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUNCE"": N and C banned -> invalid.

 Another: ""OGEES"": O-G-E-E-S -> but S banned? and duplicate E? Also E at position 3? Not 4. And we need position 4 to be E? So structure is fixed? Must be O ?? E R? So we cannot change the positions of E and R.

 So we need both positions 4 and 5 to be E and R respectively.

 Therefore, the word must be O [letter1] [letter2] E R.

 With banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 So possible letters for position 2 and 3: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z.

 We need a combination that forms a word.

 Common options:
 - ""ORDER"": O-R-D-E-R -> R at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And R at 2 would be duplicate? Also, in ""crane"", R was at 2 and marked minus? So R cannot be at position 2? So invalid? Because position 5 R is already fixed? So we cannot put R at 2? Therefore, no duplicate R? Probably? But we don't know? However, we know R is at 5? And one R? So if the secret word has only one R, then position 2 cannot be R? But if it has two R's? Then R at 2 might be possible? But in ""crane"" we had R at 2 and got minus? So meaning that if there were two R's, having R at 2 might get a minus if one of the R's is at the correct position? It's ambiguous? But to be safe, we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we already know R is not at 2? We should try a word without R in position 2? So ""ORDER"" is not suitable? Because it has R at 2.

 But let's consider: the secret word is O ?? E R? And if it were ""ORDER"", it would be O R D E R? Then:
   Position 1: O (correct)
   Position 2: R (this would be a duplicate? But if we get feedback: R is present but not at position 2? That's what we got in ""crane""? But in ""other"", we got R at position 5 correct? And if the word has two R's? Then position 2 R might still be present? So we could get a minus for R at position 2? But we already know R is present? So it wouldn't tell us nothing new? Moreover, we would get for position 2: minus? Which we already know? So we are wasting a chance to test new letters? Therefore, we should not use ""ORDER"".

 Similarly, avoid words with letters we already tested? We need to test new letters.

 So let's focus on words with two new letters? Like:

 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R? -> B and I? Is it a word? I think ""Oubier"" is a French word? But in English, it might not be accepted? Not common.

 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R? -> This has D twice? And we can test D? If ""ODDER"" is the word? Or we get information about D? But it's a valid word? Meaning ""more odd"".

 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R? -> M and B? We haven't tested M or B? So we get information.

 - ""OPTER"": O P T E R? -> but T is banned? So invalid.

 - ""OUNCE"": invalid.

 - ""OOGER""?: not a word.

 Another: ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 ""OAKUM"": doesn't fit? A banned anyway.

 ""OAVES"": not a word? A banned.

 ""OBITS"": S banned -> invalid.

 ""OGIVE"": O G I V E? but E at position 5? Not 4? In the word, E must be at 4? So ""ogive"" is O-G-I-V-E? -> E at 5? Not allowed? Because E must be at 4? So we cannot use.

 So the options are limited.

 Let's consider ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".

 ""ODDER"": 
   - Uses duplicate D? But D not banned? 
   - We test D? If D is in the word? If it is, we would get:
        Letter D at position 2 and 3? If D is in the word, and duplicated, we might get minuses? But we don't know the positions? Or it could be correct? 

 ""OMBER"": 
   - M and B? New? 

 Which is more common? ""ODDER"" is a valid word? But ""OMBER"" is more obscure? In Wordle, common words are prioritized.

 But we can search for more words:

 We need O??ER 
   Excluding: A,C,N,L,S,T,H,F

 We can try:
   B: can be at position 2 or 3? For example: O B _ E R? 

   Words: ""OBIER"" (if accepted), or with G: O G ? E R? 
   O G E not common? 

   With D: O D _ E R? ""order"" has R? So ""odder""

   With M: O M _ E R? Can be ""omber"" if we allow B? That is: 'omber' -> O M B E R? So positions: O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

   So ""OMBER"" is O M B E R.

   Similarly, O P _ E R? What words?: ""opera"" is O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4? ""OPPER""? not a word? ""OPTER"" has T banned? ""Ouped""? not.

   O U _ E R? ""oufer""? F banned? ""Ouser""? S banned? ""Ouwer""? not a word.

   O K _ E R? ""okker""? not? ""oaker""? A banned.

   O G _ E R? ""ogger""? not? ""ogre"" is 4 letters? 

   So no.

 Therefore, we have:
   ""OBIER"": if allowed? Or ""OMBER"", or ""ODDER"".

 We also have ""OAKER"", but A banned.

 Another: ""OILER"": L banned.

 Perhaps ""OVERT"" doesn't match.

 After consideration, ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

 Also, ""OWE"" variations don't work.

 So among ""ODDER"", ""OMBER"", and ""OBIER"".

 We can try ""OUNCE"" but N banned.

 Another word: ""OAKES"" S banned.

 Perhaps ""OSIER"": L? OSIER is a type of willow? But S and I? And S is banned? So invalid.

 Another: ""OATER"": A banned.

 I think the valid words are:
   - ""ODDER"": valid word? Yes, and no banned letters? O,D,E,R. In ""odder"", the letter D at position 2 and 3? So duplicate D? And E at 4 and R at 5? And O at 1? So it fits? It means more odd? Comparative of odd? Or a person who plows? Archaic? But accepted in dictionaries.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R was in position 2 and E in position 5, so the word has R but not in position 2, and E but not in position 5.
 - The word does not contain C, A, or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 - Does not contain C, A, or N.
 - Contains R and E, but R not in position 2 and E not in position 5.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think about possible positions for R and E.

 Since R is in the word but not at position 2, it could be at positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, E is in the word but not at position 5, so it could be at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

 Let's consider common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We can try to form a word that includes R and E (at different positions) and also tests other common consonants and vowels.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also introduces new letters.

 Let me think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possibilities: 
 - We can try to put R in position 1? Then we have R _ _ _ _
   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).

 Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.

 Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don't know if the word has duplicates. But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

 We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.

 So, let's try a word without duplicates.

 How about ""ROUTE""? 
 - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn't at 2 and we don't know about 1)
 - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.

 So we need E not at 5.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
 - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.
 - But we don't know if B is in the word? We are testing.

 But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.

 Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it's not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.

 Example: 
 - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.

 Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: 
   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven't tested S, T, P.

 However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).

 But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.

 Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? 
 Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? 
   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

 So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.

 How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.

 Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.

 Some words:
 - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).

 - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.

 - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don't want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R's? We don't know.

 Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 Another: ""STORE"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.

 How about ""STREW"": 
   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That's allowed. 
   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.

 This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.

 But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at 2.

 However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.

 Example: ""ERUPT"": 
   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Example: ""EGRET"": 
   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don't know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.

 But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven't tested G and T.

 However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E's.

 Another: ""EXERT"": 
   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.

 But X is not very common.

 How about ""RESET"": 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don't have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. 
   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E's? 

 We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.

 After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: 
   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. 
   We haven't tried S, T, W before.

 But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That's okay because we are confirming their positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.

 Which one is better? Both are valid.

 Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.

 Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, A, N.

 So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.

 I'll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.

 But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but it will give us information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.

 Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don't want duplicates.

 How about ""SERUM"": 
   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven't tested U and M. 
   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). 
   Also, avoids A, C, N.

 But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.

 However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.

 I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.

 Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.

 So, I'll go with ""STREW"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven't tested that. 

 However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.

 Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That's what ""ROLES"" does.

 ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.

 Which one is better? 

 We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.

 But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). 
 In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).

 So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.

 Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.
 Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.

 Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven't tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

 But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it's less likely? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.

 Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.

 How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don't know.

 Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.

 How about ""TRIED"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.

 So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.

 How about ""TROPE"": 
   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.

 After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:
 - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
 - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven't tried, and it's not 5)
 - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)

 So, I'll go with ""ROLES"".

 But let me confirm: 
   R at 1: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.
   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.

 We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.

 So, the word is ""ROLES"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.

 I think ""ROLES"" is fine.

 Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).

The word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it's not position 5).
- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, A, and N.

<guess>roles</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   Meaning:
      - C, A, N are not in the word.
      - R is in the word but not in position 2.
      - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
   Meaning:
      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).
      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).
      - L is not in the word (new information).
      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.
      - S is not in the word.

So, we now know:

- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.
- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).
- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).

Since E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _

We also know:
- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.
- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don't know where.

Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.

We have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Has E at position 4.
- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions).
- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.
- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.

Moreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).

We can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.

But note: we are limited by the letters we haven't tried. We have not tried many other letters.

Common letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don't know. Similarly for O.

Since we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.

Given constraints, let's build a word:

- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _
- We must include R and O, and we can't use C, A, N, L, S.
- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

Since E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.

We know two of them must be R and O, but we don't know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).

But note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.

Also, R must be at 3 or 5.

We can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.

Idea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.

Then we have: O _ R E _

Now we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don't know if duplicates are present.

Positions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible words:
- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.
- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.

Another: ""OORED""? -> not a word.

Another: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.

""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).

""OMPRE"": not a word.

This seems hard.

Idea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.

Then: O _ _ E R

Now we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.

Example: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.

""OILER"": but L is banned.

""OUNCE"": C not allowed.

""OOPRE"": not a word.

This is also difficult.

Idea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.

Then: _ _ O E R

Now positions 1 and 2 need filling.

Example: ""TONER"": 
   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.

""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.

But wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

So ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.

But the idea is: _ _ O E R

Possible words: 
- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.

Another: ""POWER"": 
   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn't at position 2.

The word ""POWER"" breaks down as:
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.

Therefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.

In our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.

Possible words: 
  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So: _ _ O E R

What words fit? 
- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.

""JOGER""? not common.

Or ""VOTER"": 
   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.

How about ""HOYER""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.

Then: _ _ R E O

So the word ends with R E O.

But note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.

Is there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.

""TAREO""? A not allowed.

This is difficult.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.

Then: _ _ R E O

Words: 
- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.
- ""THREO"": not a word.

Another: ""TREFO""? not a word.

Alternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _

Now we need position 2 and 5.

We remember that we haven't tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word: O ? R E ?

Examples with common letters:
- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.
- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.
- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.

Wait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: 
  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.

Also, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

Similarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It's not common but might be accepted.

""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.

Another: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.

How about ""OTHER"": 
   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? 
   So R is at position 5? That's allowed. 
   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? 
   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.

We know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.

The word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let's write:

Position 1: O
Position 2: T
Position 3: H
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We have:
- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).
- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).
- E at position 4: confirmed.
- T and H are new letters.

Does it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.

So ""OTHER"" is a candidate.

But note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.

Also, we are testing T and H.

Another possibility: ""OPTER"": 
   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

Yes, that's another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.

But ""OTHER"" is more common.

But let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".

We can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R

We have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.

Example: ""MANOR""? 
   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.

""ERROR""? 
   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.

We need E only at 4.

How about ""FUTOR""? not a word.

Then ""OTHER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.

Or ""OFFER""? 
   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
   This has duplicate F? And we don't know? But it's a valid word. 
   But duplicate F? We are testing F.

But ""OTHER"" is probably more common.

We can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3.

In ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.

Alternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it's hard without knowing O's position.

We are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that's good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don't know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.

But we want to test multiple possibilities.

Another candidate: ""ROUGE"": 
   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? 
   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won't work because E is at 5.

Why not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.

We are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

So for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it's fixed to five positions.

Thus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.

Therefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.

Similarly, we cannot use words that don't have E at 4.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: 
   Position 1: O
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: H
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

So that is acceptable.

Even better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.

If the feedback says:
- O at position 1: if it's in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it's present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don't know until we guess.

Similarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.

Another candidate: ""BOXER""? 
   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that's not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn't have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it's present but not at 2? But that's expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: 
   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn't give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.

So it's better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it's not there? And similarly for R, we know it's not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it's not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it's not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.

Therefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.

Also, we haven't used T or H before.

Therefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.

We can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.

So I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:

- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  
  - R is in the word but not in position 1.
  - O is in the word but not in position 2.
  - L and S are not in the word.
  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).
- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.
- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.

### Strategy for the New Guess:
- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.
- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn't at position 2).
  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn't at positions 1 or 2).
  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).
  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).
  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.

This word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.

<guess>other</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":
  O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- O is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a check).
- T is not in the word (x).
- H is not in the word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).
- R is correct and in position 5 (since we placed it at position 5 and got a check).

So, the word is: O _ _ E R

We know the first letter is O, the fourth is E, and the fifth is R.

We also know that the second and third letters are missing and must be filled.

From previous feedback, we know:
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (from the x's in all guesses).
- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, T, H (but only O, E, R are in the word).

We need to find two letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not in the banned list and form a valid English word.

Banned letters so far: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

We also know the word contains O, E, R, and two more letters.

The two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned ones.

Common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We need a word of the form: O ? ? E R

We can list possible words:

- ""OAKER"": but A is banned -> invalid.
- ""OATER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R. This avoids banned letters? B and I are not banned. Is ""OBIER"" a word? It might be obscure, but let's check: ""obier"" is not a common word. It might be a surname or not accepted.

- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (comparative of odd). But we have to check if it's valid: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have two D's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen duplicates so far? But it's possible.

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> duplicate F? And F is not banned. ""Offer"" is a common word.

- ""OILER"": but L is banned -> invalid.

- ""OKIER"": not a word.

- ""OLDER"": L banned -> invalid.

- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B not banned? ""Omber"" is a card game, variant of ombre? Might be accepted.

- ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.

- ""OTHER"": we already tried, and T and H are banned? But we tried ""other"" and got T and H as x, so they are not in the word? But we are looking for a new word.

We need a word that has not been tried? But we are making a new guess.

But we know T and H are not in the word? So we cannot use them.

So, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.

Possible common words:

- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it's a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don't have evidence against duplicates? So it's possible.

- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, in ""order"", R is at position 2 and 5? But we know from previous that R cannot be at position 2? Because in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 and it was minus? So the secret word has R but not at position 2? So if we have a word with R at position 2, that would be incorrect? But if the word has two R's? Then one at position 2 might be possible? But we don't know.

But in ""other"", we have R at position 5 and it was correct? So the secret word has R at position 5? So it cannot have R at position 2? Because that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates exist? So it's risky.

But let's see: from ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? That means that either the secret word has R but not at position 2? Or it has R at position 2 but we got minus? No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R's, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2? So we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we know it's not there? So ""ORDER"" would have R at 2? Which we know is not correct? So it would be a waste? But we are trying to find the word? So we should not use ""ORDER"" because it has R at 2? Which is known to be wrong.

Therefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.

Similarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don't know if F is in the word? So we can try.

But we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can't rule it out.

But to be safe, let's look for words without duplicates.

Possible words without duplicates:

- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.
- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.
- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.

So the word must be O ?? ER.

We can think of common words:

- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.
- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.
- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.

We need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.

Common words:
- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)
- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.
- ""OATER"": A banned.
- ""OBIER"": as above.
- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.
- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.
- ""OGEED"": not a word? 
- ""OILER"": L banned.
- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.
- ""OLDER"": L banned.
- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It's a card game. But we can consider.
- ""ONCER"": N banned.
- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it's wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.

Similarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.

""OTHER"" we already tried.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.

""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.

""OVERT"": as above, doesn't fit.

""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.

""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.

""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven't banned Z? But let's see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.

So, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".

But ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it's a valid word.

Another possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.

We need O at the beginning.

""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let's search for more.

""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.

Another: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""OUBIT""? not.

I think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.

But we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don't know? But we can try.

But we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.

F is not banned? So it's allowed.

Similarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.

Or ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""OGEED""? not.

""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.

""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.

""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.

We need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.

So not.

""OILED"": L banned.

I think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".

But ""offer"" is more common.

Another common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.

But let's confirm the structure: O F F E R

- Position 1: O (correct, we know)
- Position 2: F (new)
- Position 3: F (duplicate F)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

We are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.

If the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.

If not, we get feedback on F.

But we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.

We can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.

""OWLED"": L banned.

""OARED"": A banned.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.

Another word: ""OUBIT""? not.

""OFLET""? not a word.

""OAKUM""? not.

Perhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.

In Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""OFFER"".

But we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don't know.

But we can try.

Alternatively, is there a word with two different letters?

For example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.

""OMMER"": not.

""OUNCE"": invalid.

""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.

""OPERA"": A banned.

""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.

Not.

So, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - C (x): Not in the word.  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - A (x): Not in the word.  
  - N (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.

- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  
  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  
  - L (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  
  - S (x): Not in the word.  
  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.

- **Guess 3: other**  
  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  
  - T (x): Not in the word.  
  - H (x): Not in the word.  
  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  
  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  
  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: O  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  
- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  
- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  
- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  
- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  
- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven't ruled out duplicates).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it's in the word and its position(s).  
- **Why not other words?**  
  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  
  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  

""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.

<guess>offer</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: offer -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from the fourth guess ""offer"":
 O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)

 This means:
 - O at position 1 is correct (already known).
 - F is not in the word at all? Both F's are marked 'x'. So F is not in the word.
 - E at position 4 is correct (known).
 - R at position 5 is correct (known).

 So the word remains: O ? ? E R

 And we now know that F is not in the word.

 Previously, we have banned letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.

 The word must be O followed by two letters, then E and R.

 The two middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 We have not tried: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, and some others.

 We must form a valid English word.

 Common words that fit O ? ? E R:

 - ""OAKER"": not valid (and A is banned).
 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> B and I? Not common, but possible.
 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (meaning more odd). But duplicate.
 - ""OGLER"": but L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.
 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a card game variant. Not common, but accepted in word games.
 - ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUBET""? not a word.
 - ""OUNCE"": N banned? and C banned? So invalid.
 - ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 But note: ""offer"" had two F's and both were wrong? So F is entirely banned? So we must avoid F.

 Also, we have not tried D, G, I, M, P, U, etc.

 Let's list possible words without the banned letters:

 - ""OBIER"": O-B-I-E-R -> banned? B and I are allowed? But is it a word? Not in common use.
 - ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OCTET"": C and T banned -> invalid.
 - ""ODDER"": O-D-D-E-R -> duplicates D? But allowed? And D not banned? 
 - ""OPERA"": A banned -> invalid.
 - ""OTHER"": already tried -> invalid.
 - ""OTTER"": T banned -> invalid.
 - ""OUNCE"": N and C banned -> invalid.

 Another: ""OGEES"": O-G-E-E-S -> but S banned? and duplicate E? Also E at position 3? Not 4. And we need position 4 to be E? So structure is fixed? Must be O ?? E R? So we cannot change the positions of E and R.

 So we need both positions 4 and 5 to be E and R respectively.

 Therefore, the word must be O [letter1] [letter2] E R.

 With banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.

 So possible letters for position 2 and 3: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z.

 We need a combination that forms a word.

 Common options:
 - ""ORDER"": O-R-D-E-R -> R at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And R at 2 would be duplicate? Also, in ""crane"", R was at 2 and marked minus? So R cannot be at position 2? So invalid? Because position 5 R is already fixed? So we cannot put R at 2? Therefore, no duplicate R? Probably? But we don't know? However, we know R is at 5? And one R? So if the secret word has only one R, then position 2 cannot be R? But if it has two R's? Then R at 2 might be possible? But in ""crane"" we had R at 2 and got minus? So meaning that if there were two R's, having R at 2 might get a minus if one of the R's is at the correct position? It's ambiguous? But to be safe, we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we already know R is not at 2? We should try a word without R in position 2? So ""ORDER"" is not suitable? Because it has R at 2.

 But let's consider: the secret word is O ?? E R? And if it were ""ORDER"", it would be O R D E R? Then:
   Position 1: O (correct)
   Position 2: R (this would be a duplicate? But if we get feedback: R is present but not at position 2? That's what we got in ""crane""? But in ""other"", we got R at position 5 correct? And if the word has two R's? Then position 2 R might still be present? So we could get a minus for R at position 2? But we already know R is present? So it wouldn't tell us nothing new? Moreover, we would get for position 2: minus? Which we already know? So we are wasting a chance to test new letters? Therefore, we should not use ""ORDER"".

 Similarly, avoid words with letters we already tested? We need to test new letters.

 So let's focus on words with two new letters? Like:

 - ""OBIER"": O B I E R? -> B and I? Is it a word? I think ""Oubier"" is a French word? But in English, it might not be accepted? Not common.

 - ""ODDER"": O D D E R? -> This has D twice? And we can test D? If ""ODDER"" is the word? Or we get information about D? But it's a valid word? Meaning ""more odd"".

 - ""OMBER"": O M B E R? -> M and B? We haven't tested M or B? So we get information.

 - ""OPTER"": O P T E R? -> but T is banned? So invalid.

 - ""OUNCE"": invalid.

 - ""OOGER""?: not a word.

 Another: ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.

 ""OAKUM"": doesn't fit? A banned anyway.

 ""OAVES"": not a word? A banned.

 ""OBITS"": S banned -> invalid.

 ""OGIVE"": O G I V E? but E at position 5? Not 4? In the word, E must be at 4? So ""ogive"" is O-G-I-V-E? -> E at 5? Not allowed? Because E must be at 4? So we cannot use.

 So the options are limited.

 Let's consider ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".

 ""ODDER"": 
   - Uses duplicate D? But D not banned? 
   - We test D? If D is in the word? If it is, we would get:
        Letter D at position 2 and 3? If D is in the word, and duplicated, we might get minuses? But we don't know the positions? Or it could be correct? 

 ""OMBER"": 
   - M and B? New? 

 Which is more common? ""ODDER"" is a valid word? But ""OMBER"" is more obscure? In Wordle, common words are prioritized.

 But we can search for more words:

 We need O??ER 
   Excluding: A,C,N,L,S,T,H,F

 We can try:
   B: can be at position 2 or 3? For example: O B _ E R? 

   Words: ""OBIER"" (if accepted), or with G: O G ? E R? 
   O G E not common? 

   With D: O D _ E R? ""order"" has R? So ""odder""

   With M: O M _ E R? Can be ""omber"" if we allow B? That is: 'omber' -> O M B E R? So positions: O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 

   So ""OMBER"" is O M B E R.

   Similarly, O P _ E R? What words?: ""opera"" is O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4? ""OPPER""? not a word? ""OPTER"" has T banned? ""Ouped""? not.

   O U _ E R? ""oufer""? F banned? ""Ouser""? S banned? ""Ouwer""? not a word.

   O K _ E R? ""okker""? not? ""oaker""? A banned.

   O G _ E R? ""ogger""? not? ""ogre"" is 4 letters? 

   So no.

 Therefore, we have:
   ""OBIER"": if allowed? Or ""OMBER"", or ""ODDER"".

 We also have ""OAKER"", but A banned.

 Another: ""OILER"": L banned.

 Perhaps ""OVERT"" doesn't match.

 After consideration, ""OUNCE"" is invalid.

 Also, ""OWE"" variations don't work.

 So among ""ODDER"", ""OMBER"", and ""OBIER"".

 We can try ""OUNCE"" but N banned.

 Another word: ""OAKES"" S banned.

 Perhaps ""OSIER"": L? OSIER is a type of willow? But S and I? And S is banned? So invalid.

 Another: ""OATER"": A banned.

 I think the valid words are:
   - ""ODDER"": valid word? Yes, and no banned letters? O,D,E,R. In ""odder"", the letter D at position 2 and 3? So duplicate D? And E at 4 and R at 5? And O at 1? So it fits? It means more odd? Comparative of odd? Or a person who plows? Archaic? But accepted in dictionaries.

   - ""OMBER"": a card game? Accepted? Might be in the word bank.

   - ""OBIER"": not common? Not in all dictionaries? So less likely.

   - ""ONCER"": N banned.

   - ""OKIER"": not a word? 

 So I think we should choose between ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".

 We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We must try one.

 We have two guesses left? We are on the fifth guess.

 Let's pick ""ODDER"" because it is more common?

 But ""OMBER"" might be just as valid.

 But we can also choose a word that doesn't have duplicates? Then we test two different letters? But we don't have many words.

 Alternatively, we can think of words like ""OPTER""? T banned.

 ""OUTER"": T banned.

 ""OUBER""?: not.

 I think we have to use either ""OMBER"" or ""ODDER"".

 Let's choose ""OMBER"" first? Because it tests two new letters: M and B? Rather than duplicate D.

 But ""ODDER"" tests D? But only one new letter? Because D is replicated? So if D is in the word, it must be duplicated? So we get less information? Whereas ""OMBER"" tests both M and B? So if we get minuses or x for both, we know they are not in the word.

 So ""OMBER"" might be better? It tests M at position 2 and B at position 3? Both new.

 Therefore, I'll choose ""OMBER"".

 But is it in Wordle's word list? We can assume it is? Or use a safer word? Is there a safer word?

 Another: ""OAKUM"" doesn't fit.

 So I think ""OMBER"" is valid.

 We can try ""OPERA""? Not? A banned.

 Or ""OWE""? Not 5 letters.

 So: guess ""OMBER"".

 But in ""OMBER"", we have O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So matches the structure.

 And banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F are avoided.

 So it's a valid guess.

 Therefore, guessed word is ""OMBER"".

 But let's double-check:

 Guess: ""omber""
   If the word is ""omber"", then we get it right? If not, then we get feedback on M and B? Which is useful for the last guess.

 Alternatively, if we try ""odder"", and it's not the word? Then we know D is duplicated? But we don't have D in other letters? So not so useful? Whereas ""omber"" gives info on two distinct letters.

 So better.### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - Excluded: C, A, N.  
  - R and E are in the word (wrong positions).  
- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - Excluded: L, S.  
  - Confirmed: E is at position 4 (✓).  
  - R is not in position 1, O is not in position 2.  
- **Guess 3: other**  
  - Excluded: T, H.  
  - Confirmed: O is at position 1 (✓), E is at position 4 (✓), R is at position 5 (✓).  
  - **Word structure: O _ _ E R**.  
- **Guess 4: offer**  
  - Excluded: F.  
  - Confirmed: O (✓), E (✓), R (✓) positions remain unchanged.  
  - Feedback for F: Both occurrences are ""x"" → **F is not in the word**.

### Current Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- The goal is to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the allowed pool that form valid English words.  
- Prioritize testing **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., M, B, D) to maximize information.  
- Candidate: **""OMBER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` → O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Tests M (position 2) and B (position 3), both new and common letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on M and B reveals their presence/absence.  
- Why not other candidates?  
  - ""ODDER"": Uses duplicate D (less informative if D is absent).  
  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon word (low probability).  
  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known incorrect).  
  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.

Then we have R _ _ _ _\n   And E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (since not 5 and we have 5 positions).\n\n Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R at 1, E at 5? But E cannot be at position 5 (from feedback). So avoid E at 5.\n\n Another: ""RISER"" -> but we have duplicate R? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates. But let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\n We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but without evidence, we assume no duplicates.\n\n So, let\'s try a word without duplicates.\n\n How about ""ROUTE""? \n - R at position 1 (which is allowed, since R wasn\'t at 2 and we don\'t know about 1)\n - O, U, T, E: but E is at position 5 -> not allowed because E cannot be at position 5.\n\n So we need E not at 5.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? \n - R at 1, E at 4? (position 4 is allowed for E) and S at 5.\n - But we don\'t know if B is in the word? We are testing.\n\n But we also have to avoid A and C and N, which we are.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have more than one E? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position.\n\n Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we know it\'s not there, we can try R in position 3 or 4.\n\n Let me think of words with R in position 3 or 4 and E in a position that is not 5.\n\n Example: \n - R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\n   Then E can be in position 1,2,4.\n\n Example word: ""STREP"" -> S T R E P: \n   E is at position 4 -> allowed? But we haven\'t tested S, T, P.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters that we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word, but S, T, P are new.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter E at position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we have to check if ""STREP"" is a valid word? It is (meaning strep throat).\n\n But let me see: we have R at position 3 (which is new) and E at position 4 (which is allowed).\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position.\n\n Another idea: we know E is in the word but not at 5, so we can try E at position 1? \n Example: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, R at 3? \n   But we have to avoid A? ""EARLY"" has A -> but we know A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.\n\n So we cannot use ""EARLY"" because it contains A.\n\n How about ""EERIE""? But that has duplicate E and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we already know E is in the word, but we want to test new letters.\n\n Let me try to list words without A, C, N, and without E at 5 and without R at 2.\n\n Some words:\n - ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4? -> R(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n   This avoids A, C, N. And E is at 4 (allowed) and R at 1 (allowed, because previously R was at 2 and now we are trying 1).\n\n - ""RILES"": similar, R at 1, I, L, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n - ""RIPER"": duplicate R? and E at 4? but we don\'t want duplicates? and also E at 4 is allowed, but the word has two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n Let me avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another: ""STORE"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed! So we cannot use.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at 5? not allowed.\n\n How about ""STREW"": \n   S, T, R, E, W -> R at 3, E at 4? That\'s allowed. \n   So: positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:R, 4:E, 5:W.\n\n This word ""STREW"" has R at 3 (which is a new position) and E at 4 (allowed). It also introduces S, T, W.\n\n But note: we have to check if R is allowed at 3? Yes, because we only know it\'s not at 2.\n\n However, we are using R at 3 and E at 4. Also, we are testing S, T, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 1 or 2.\n\n Example: ""ERUPT"": \n   E at 1, R at 2? But wait, we know R is in the word but not at position 2! So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, if we put E at 1, then R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Example: ""EGRET"": \n   E at 1, G, R at 3, E at 4? -> duplicate E? and we don\'t know. Also, we have E at 1 and 4? But we already know E is in the word, so duplicate E might be possible.\n\n But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters. Also, we haven\'t tested G and T.\n\n However, we are avoiding A, C, N, so ""EGRET"" is acceptable? But it has two E\'s.\n\n Another: ""EXERT"": \n   E at 1, X, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 4 (allowed). But we are testing X and T.\n\n But X is not very common.\n\n How about ""RESET"": \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate E? and R at 1 (allowed) but E at 2? We don\'t have any restriction on E at 2? Only that it cannot be at 5. \n   However, we also know that R is not at 2, but here R is at 1 and E at 2. But the word has two E\'s? \n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible, so duplicates are not ideal.\n\n After considering, I think ""STREW"" is a good candidate: \n   It uses S, T, R (at 3), E (at 4), W. \n   We haven\'t tried S, T, W before.\n\n But note: we are using R and E again, but in new positions. That\'s okay because we are confirming their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROLES"" (R at 1, E at 4) which uses O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? Both are valid.\n\n Let me check commonality: both are acceptable.\n\n Another word: ""PRICE"" -> but we know C is not in the word? So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, A, N.\n\n So, ""STREW"" and ""ROLES"" are both without C, A, N.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STREW"" because it tests more common consonants (S and T) and also W.\n\n But note: we are using R at position 3 and E at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but it will give us information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position, such as position 1, without R at 2.\n\n Example: ""SPREE"" -> duplicate E? and R at 3? But we don\'t want duplicates.\n\n How about ""SERUM"": \n   S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, U at 4, M at 5 -> but we haven\'t tested U and M. \n   And E is at 2 (allowed) and R at 3 (allowed). \n   Also, avoids A, C, N.\n\n But we already know that E is in the word, so having E at 2 is new. And R at 3 is new.\n\n However, we are testing U and M, which are less common than T or L.\n\n I think ""STREW"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me see: we have two known letters (R and E) and we are placing them in positions that are allowed. We are also testing three new letters: S, T, W.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STREW"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has R at position 1? We haven\'t tested that. \n\n However, we are testing R at 3 and E at 4. If we get feedback that R is not at 3, then we know it must be at 1,4, or 5 (but not 2). Similarly for E.\n\n Alternatively, we can test R at position 1 and E at position 4 in the same word? That\'s what ""ROLES"" does.\n\n ""ROLES"": R at 1, E at 4. Then we are testing O, L, S.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We have two known letters and we are testing three new ones in both cases.\n\n But note: in ""STREW"", we are testing two common consonants (S and T) and one less common (W). \n In ""ROLES"", we are testing O, L, S (all common).\n\n So ""ROLES"" might be better because O and L are very common.\n\n Also, we are testing R at position 1 and E at position 4, which are two different positions.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""STREW"" -> tests positions: R at 3, E at 4, and letters S, T, W.\n Option 2: ""ROLES"" -> tests positions: R at 1, E at 4, and letters O, L, S.\n\n Since we know R is not at 2, and we haven\'t tested position 1 for R, it might be more likely that R is at 1? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know.\n\n But we can get more information by testing a new position for R.\n\n I think both are reasonable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now, if we put R at position 1, that is adjacent? Maybe it\'s less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a completely different position, like 4 or 5.\n\n Example: ""WAVER"" -> but we avoid A (and W at 1, E at 4, R at 5). But A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""PURER"": duplicate R? and we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""LAPSE"" -> but A is not allowed.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> but we cannot put R at 2! Because we know R is in the word but not at position 2.\n\n So we cannot use ""TRIED"" because R is at 2.\n\n How about ""TROPE"": \n   T at 1, R at 2? -> again, R at 2 is not allowed.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, for R we can only use positions 1,3,4,5.\n\n After considering, I think ""ROLES"" is a good choice because:\n - It tests R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n - It tests E at position 4 (which we haven\'t tried, and it\'s not 5)\n - It introduces O, L, S (common letters)\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ROLES"".\n\n But let me confirm: \n   R at 1: if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is in the word, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n   Similarly, E at 4: if not correct, we get a minus.\n\n We are also testing O at 2, L at 3, S at 5.\n\n So, the word is ""ROLES"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""RILES"" (which is also valid) but that uses I instead of O. I is a vowel and common, but O is also common.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is fine.\n\n Final decision: ""ROLES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with x).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with -).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, A, or N.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (like O, L, S) and position R in a new location (position 1) and E in a new location (position 4).\n\nThe word ""ROLES"" fits these criteria:\n- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it\'s not position 5).\n- Introduces new letters: O, L, S (common letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C, A, and N.\n\n<guess>roles</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n   Meaning:\n      - C, A, N are not in the word.\n      - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n      - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. Second guess: ""roles"" -> Feedback: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\n   Meaning:\n      - R is in the word (we already knew) but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a minus).\n      - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2).\n      - L is not in the word (new information).\n      - E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since in ""roles"", E is at position 4). This is confirmed by the checkmark.\n      - S is not in the word.\n\nSo, we now know:\n\n- The word contains R, O, E. Also, we knew E from before, and now we have O and R.\n- E is fixed at position 4 (because in ""roles"" we had E at position 4 and it was correct).\n- The word does NOT contain: C, A, N, L, S (and also the letters that were x in both guesses).\n\nSince E is at position 4, the word is: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe also know:\n- R is in the word but cannot be at position 1 (from ""roles"") or position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be at position 3 or 5.\n- O is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""roles""). Since positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are open (position 4 is E) for O, but we don\'t know where.\n\nAdditionally, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, L, S.\n\nWe have two more known letters: R and O. And we know E is at position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Has E at position 4.\n- Contains R and O (since they are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions).\n- Does not contain C, A, N, L, S.\n- The word must also be a valid 5-letter word.\n\nMoreover, we want to test possible positions for R and O.\n\nPossible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,5 (because it cannot be at 2, and 4 is taken by E).\n\nWe can try a word that puts R in position 3 and O in position 1 or 5? Or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the letters we haven\'t tried. We have not tried many other letters.\n\nCommon letters that might be in the word: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have more than one of a letter? For example, if R is at 3, it cannot be at 5? But we don\'t know. Similarly for O.\n\nSince we are allowed only 6 guesses and this is the third, we can design a word to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nGiven constraints, let\'s build a word:\n\n- Position 4 must be E: _ _ _ E _\n- We must include R and O, and we can\'t use C, A, N, L, S.\n- We are missing two more letters? Actually, the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have to fill positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSince E is at 4, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe know two of them must be R and O, but we don\'t know which positions. The remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (which are not in the banned list).\n\nBut note: O cannot be at position 2? We found from ""roles"" that O is in the word but not at position 2. So O can be at 1,3,5.\n\nAlso, R must be at 3 or 5.\n\nWe can try to place R and O in their possible positions while testing new letters.\n\nIdea 1: Put R at position 3 and O at position 1.\n\nThen we have: O _ R E _\n\nNow we need to fill position 2 and 5. We must choose letters not in {C,A,N,L,S}. Also, we have to avoid duplicates? We don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nPositions 2 and 5: We can choose common letters not yet tried: T, B, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""OARED"": but A is not allowed -> invalid.\n- ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This avoids C,A,N,L,S? G and D are allowed. But is ""OGRED"" a word? Not sure.\n\nAnother: ""OORED""? -> not a word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBED""? -> not a word.\n\n""OILED"": but I and L -> L is banned (from ""roles"" feedback, L is not in the word).\n\n""OMPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis seems hard.\n\nIdea 2: Put O at position 1 and R at position 5.\n\nThen: O _ _ E R\n\nNow we need positions 2 and 3. We can try common letters.\n\nExample: ""OATER"": but A not allowed.\n\n""OILER"": but L is banned.\n\n""OUNCE"": C not allowed.\n\n""OOPRE"": not a word.\n\nThis is also difficult.\n\nIdea 3: Put R at position 5 and O at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ O E R\n\nNow positions 1 and 2 need filling.\n\nExample: ""TONER"": \n   T at 1, O at 3? -> but O is at position 3, R at 5? We have E at 4. So: T _ O E R? Actually, the word is T X O E R? But we need letter at position 2.\n\n""TONER"" is T O N E R? -> but N is banned? Because from first guess N at position 4 was x.\n\nBut wait, in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.\n\nSo ""TONER"" has N -> invalid.\n\nBut the idea is: _ _ O E R\n\nPossible words: \n- We need two first letters: for positions 1 and 2.\n\nAnother: ""POWER"": \n   P at 1, O at 3? -> the word is: P W O E R -> so O is at 3? Actually, ""POWER"" is P O W E R? Then that would be O at position 2? But O cannot be at position 2? We know O is not at position 2 (from ""roles"" feedback: O at 2 was minus). So if we put ""POWER"", then O is at position 2? That would be the same as before? But we know O isn\'t at position 2.\n\nThe word ""POWER"" breaks down as:\n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: O -> but we know O cannot be at position 2? So we cannot have a word with O at 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot consider words with O at position 2.\n\nIn our pattern, if we have O at position 3, then we need to fill positions 1 and 2.\n\nPossible words: \n  Position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nSo: _ _ O E R\n\nWhat words fit? \n- They must be 5 letters: first two letters should form a word with ""OER"" at the end? Actually ""OER"" is rare.\n\n""JOGER""? not common.\n\nOr ""VOTER"": \n   V at 1, O at 3? No: ""VOTER"" is V O T E R -> that would be O at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOWER"" has O at 2 -> not allowed.\n\nHow about ""HOYER""? Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 5 and R at position 3.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nSo the word ends with R E O.\n\nBut note: R at position 3 and O at position 5? Then we have positions 1 and 2 to fill.\n\nIs there a common word? ""BUREO""? not a word.\n\n""TAREO""? A not allowed.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, we can try putting R at position 3 and O at position 5.\n\nThen: _ _ R E O\n\nWords: \n- ""CHIEO"": not a word and C is banned.\n- ""THREO"": not a word.\n\nAnother: ""TREFO""? not a word.\n\nAlternatively, put O at position 1 and R at position 3? Then we have O _ R E _\n\nNow we need position 2 and 5.\n\nWe remember that we haven\'t tried many letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nWe need a word: O ? R E ?\n\nExamples with common letters:\n- ""OGRES"" -> but S is banned? So ""OGRES"" is not allowed because S is banned.\n- ""OILRE"" -> not a word and L banned.\n- ""ORDER"": has O at 1, R at 2 and 3? Duplicate R? But we don\'t know. Also, D at 4? But E must be at position 4? So ""ORDER"" would be O,R,D,E,R? But position 4 is E? So not ORDER.\n\nWait: E must be at position 4. So ""ORDER"" is O R D E R? Then that looks promising: \n  O at 1, R at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R at 2: we know R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"" feedback). So we cannot have R at position 2.\n\nAlso, ""ORDER"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""OGRED"": O at 1, G at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> valid word? It is an adjective meaning having the appearance of an ogre. It\'s not common but might be accepted.\n\n""OGRED"" is a word? Maybe. But we can try to find a more common word.\n\nAnother: ""OUBRE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKRE""? A banned, R at 5? But A not allowed.\n\nHow about ""OTHER"": \n   O T H E R -> O at 1, T at 2, H at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This uses H and T? And position 3 is H? \n   So R is at position 5? That\'s allowed. \n   But we have O at position 1? Allowed? Yes, provided O is not at 2? But O is at 1, so allowed? \n   Also, avoid C,A,N,L,S? Yes, T and H are not banned.\n\nWe know O is in the word and not at 2? So having O at 1 is possible? The feedback for R in the second guess (""roles"") was minus at position 1? But that was R? For O it was minus at position 2? So O can be anywhere except 2? So position 1 is allowed.\n\nThe word ""OTHER"" is a valid word: _ _ _ E _ ? Let\'s write:\n\nPosition 1: O\nPosition 2: T\nPosition 3: H\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R\n\nWe have:\n- R is at position 5: which is allowed (since R must be at 3 or 5? And here it is at 5).\n- O is at position 1: which is allowed (since not at 2).\n- E at position 4: confirmed.\n- T and H are new letters.\n\nDoes it avoid banned letters? Yes: C,A,N,L,S not present.\n\nSo ""OTHER"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we must have O and R? And we do: O at 1 and R at 5.\n\nAlso, we are testing T and H.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OPTER"": \n   O P T E R -> O at 1, P at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This is similar: O _ _ E R -> but we skip position 2? No, positions: 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nYes, that\'s another word: ""OPTER"" is a word? It means ""one who opts"", but it might be rare.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is more common.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be _ _ _ E _ and we are making ""OTHER"".\n\nWe can also try to put O at position 3 and R at position 5? Then we need a word: _ _ O E R\n\nWe have to avoid O at position 2? Position 3 is allowed? Yes.\n\nExample: ""MANOR""? \n   M A N O R -> but A and N banned.\n\n""ERROR""? \n   E R R O R -> duplicate R? And E cannot be at position 4? Actually: position1: E? but that might conflict? And E is at position 4 fixed? Cannot change? So ""ERROR"" is E at 1 -> not fixed E at 4.\n\nWe need E only at 4.\n\nHow about ""FUTOR""? not a word.\n\nThen ""OTHER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""OVERP"" -> not a word? ""Overplay""? too long.\n\nOr ""OFFER""? \n   O F F E R -> O at 1, F at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n   This has duplicate F? And we don\'t know? But it\'s a valid word. \n   But duplicate F? We are testing F.\n\nBut ""OTHER"" is probably more common.\n\nWe can also consider: E at 4 fixed, R at 3? We haven\'t tested R at 3.\n\nIn ""OTHER"", we are testing R at 5? So we need to test R at 3? But we can do that in a later guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can test both possibilities? But it\'s hard without knowing O\'s position.\n\nWe are testing O at 1 and R at 5? So if we get feedback that R is at 5 and O at 1, that\'s good. Or if R is not at 5 but in the word, then it must be at 3? Similarly for O? But we don\'t know if O is at 1? We might get minuses.\n\nBut we want to test multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUGE"": \n   R at 1? -> not allowed (we know R cannot be at 1 from ""roles""? We got minus for R at 1 in ""roles"", so R is in the word but not at 1? So we cannot put R at 1? \n   Also, we have E at 4? So: R O U G E? Then E is at 5? Not allowed? We must have E at 4? So ""ROUGE"" won\'t work because E is at 5.\n\nWhy not? Because E must be at position 4? The secret word has E at position 4? So any word we guess must have E at position 4? To get the feedback correct.\n\nWe are required to make a valid guess? So yes, we must use E at position 4? Because in our guess we must have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nSo for ""ROUGE"", if we put it as R O U E ??? wait, we have to shift? No: it\'s fixed to five positions.\n\nThus, we cannot use words that have E at the 5th? Only at the 4th.\n\nTherefore, only words with E at position 4 are allowed? We must have E at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use words that don\'t have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" (O T H E R) has E at 4? Yes: \n   Position 1: O\n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: H\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\nSo that is acceptable.\n\nEven better: it tests O at position 1 and R at position 5? Which are possible? Yes.\n\nIf the feedback says:\n- O at position 1: if it\'s in the word and at correct position? Then we get a check? Or if it\'s present but in wrong position? We know O cannot be at 2? But position 1 might be correct or not? We don\'t know until we guess.\n\nSimilarly for R at 5? At least we are testing it.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BOXER""? \n   B O X E R -> O at position 2? But we know O cannot be at position 2? Because in ""roles"" we placed O at position 2 and got minus. So O is in the word? But not at 2? So any word that has O at 2 would be invalid? But the word ""BOXER"" would have O at 2? So that\'s not allowed? Because we know the secret word doesn\'t have O at 2? So it cannot be O at 2? Therefore, we cannot use ""BOXER"" because it forces O to position 2? But the secret word has O somewhere else? So such a word would have a error? Wait no, we can still guess ""BOXER""? But then in feedback for O it would be minus? Because it\'s present but not at 2? But that\'s expected? But the word cannot have O at 2? So why not? Actually, we can guess any 5-letter word? So ""BOXER"" is allowed? But it would be: \n   B at position 1, O at 2 (we know O cannot be there? So we will get minus for O? Why would we want that? It doesn\'t give us new information? Because we already know O is not at 2.\n\nSo it\'s better not to put O at 2? Because we already know it\'s not there? And similarly for R, we know it\'s not at 1 or 2? So avoid positions 1 for R and 2 for O? And positions 1 and 2 for R? More in? We know R is not at 1 or 2? We should avoid putting R at 1 or 2? Because we know it\'s not there? Then we can focus on positions 3 and 5 for R? Similarly, for O, we know it\'s not at 2? So avoid position 2 for O? And now we are considering O at 1,3, or 5.\n\nTherefore, ""OTHER"" has O at 1? Which is allowed? And R at 5? Which is allowed? And E at 4? And we test T and H.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used T or H before.\n\nTherefore, I think ""OTHER"" is a good choice.\n\nWe can also think of ""INKER""? But I and K? And E? Also N? N is banned? So no.\n\nSo I will go with ""OTHER"".Based on the feedback provided:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: -)**  \n  - C, A, and N are not in the word.\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2: roles (R: -, O: -, L: x, E: ✓, S: x)**  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 1.\n  - O is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - L and S are not in the word.\n  - E is in position 4 (✓) — this is confirmed.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has **E in position 4** (fixed).\n- The word **contains R and O**, and avoids C, A, N, L, S.\n- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 3 or 5.\n- O cannot be in position 2 (from feedback), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n- The word structure is: `_ _ _ E _`.\n\n### Strategy for the New Guess:\n- Prioritize testing possible positions for R (3 or 5) and O (1, 3, or 5).\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, H, D, M, P) while avoiding banned letters.\n- ""OTHER"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - Places O at position 1 (allowed, since O isn\'t at position 2).\n  - Places R at position 5 (allowed, since R isn\'t at positions 1 or 2).\n  - Tests T at position 2 and H at position 3 (new letters).\n  - Maintains E at position 4 (confirmed).\n  - Avoids C, A, N, L, S.\n\nThis word efficiently narrows down R and O positions and provides valuable information regardless of feedback.\n\n<guess>other</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""other"":\n  O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- O is correct and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got a check).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- H is not in the word (x).\n- E is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).\n- R is correct and in position 5 (since we placed it at position 5 and got a check).\n\nSo, the word is: O _ _ E R\n\nWe know the first letter is O, the fourth is E, and the fifth is R.\n\nWe also know that the second and third letters are missing and must be filled.\n\nFrom previous feedback, we know:\n- The word does not contain: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n- We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, T, H (but only O, E, R are in the word).\n\nWe need to find two letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not in the banned list and form a valid English word.\n\nBanned letters so far: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.\n\nWe also know the word contains O, E, R, and two more letters.\n\nThe two missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the banned ones.\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nWe need a word of the form: O ? ? E R\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- ""OAKER"": but A is banned -> invalid.\n- ""OATER"": A banned -> invalid.\n- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:E, 5:R. This avoids banned letters? B and I are not banned. Is ""OBIER"" a word? It might be obscure, but let\'s check: ""obier"" is not a common word. It might be a surname or not accepted.\n\n- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (comparative of odd). But we have to check if it\'s valid: O at 1, D at 2, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have two D\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven\'t seen duplicates so far? But it\'s possible.\n\n- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> duplicate F? And F is not banned. ""Offer"" is a common word.\n\n- ""OILER"": but L is banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OKIER"": not a word.\n\n- ""OLDER"": L banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B not banned? ""Omber"" is a card game, variant of ombre? Might be accepted.\n\n- ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.\n\n- ""OTHER"": we already tried, and T and H are banned? But we tried ""other"" and got T and H as x, so they are not in the word? But we are looking for a new word.\n\nWe need a word that has not been tried? But we are making a new guess.\n\nBut we know T and H are not in the word? So we cannot use them.\n\nSo, for the word O ? ? E R, we need to fill with two letters that are not banned and form a valid word.\n\nPossible common words:\n\n- ""OFFER"": O F F E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:F, 3:F, 4:E, 5:R. This has duplicate F? But it\'s a valid word. We can test it? But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed? But we don\'t have evidence against duplicates? So it\'s possible.\n\n- ""ORDER"": O R D E R -> but R is at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And we have R at position 2? That would be two R\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Also, in ""order"", R is at position 2 and 5? But we know from previous that R cannot be at position 2? Because in ""crane"" we had R at position 2 and it was minus? So the secret word has R but not at position 2? So if we have a word with R at position 2, that would be incorrect? But if the word has two R\'s? Then one at position 2 might be possible? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""other"", we have R at position 5 and it was correct? So the secret word has R at position 5? So it cannot have R at position 2? Because that would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates exist? So it\'s risky.\n\nBut let\'s see: from ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? That means that either the secret word has R but not at position 2? Or it has R at position 2 but we got minus? No, minus means it is in the word but not at that position? So if the secret word has only one R, then it cannot be at position 2? But if it has two R\'s, then it could be at position 2 and also at 5? But in ""other"", we have R at 5 and it was correct? So if the secret word has R at 5, then if we put R at 2 in a guess, we might get a minus? But we already know R is not at 2? So we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we know it\'s not there? So ""ORDER"" would have R at 2? Which we know is not correct? So it would be a waste? But we are trying to find the word? So we should not use ""ORDER"" because it has R at 2? Which is known to be wrong.\n\nTherefore, ""ORDER"" is not a good choice.\n\nSimilarly, ""OFFER"" has F at 2 and 3? So duplicate F? But we don\'t know if F is in the word? So we can try.\n\nBut we have to consider: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t encountered any yet? So we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can\'t rule it out.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s look for words without duplicates.\n\nPossible words without duplicates:\n\n- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.\n- ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> no duplicate? B and I. Is it a word? Not common.\n- ""OCHER"": O C H E R -> but C and H are banned? C from first guess, H from third guess? So invalid.\n- ""OGLER"": L banned -> invalid.\n- ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.\n- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER? We need E at 4 and R at 5? So must end with ER? So the last two are fixed: E and R.\n\nSo the word must be O ?? ER.\n\nWe can think of common words:\n\n- ""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> but N and C banned -> invalid.\n- ""OUTER"": O U T E R -> T is banned? From third guess, T is not in the word? So invalid.\n- ""OVER"": too short? Must be 5 letters? ""OVER"" is 4? ""OVERT"": O V E R T -> but T is banned? And E is at position 3? But we need E at position 4? So ""OVERT"" is O V E R T -> positions: 1:O, 2:V, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T -> but E is at 3, not 4? And R at 4? But we need E at 4 and R at 5? So not matching.\n\nWe need E at 4 and R at 5? So the word must be O ? ? E R.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""OAKER"": invalid (A)\n- ""OATEN"": N banned and not ending with ER? ""Oaten"" is O A T E N -> not ER at end.\n- ""OATER"": A banned.\n- ""OBIER"": as above.\n- ""OCHER"": C and H banned.\n- ""OFFER"": duplicate F? But common.\n- ""OGEED"": not a word? \n- ""OILER"": L banned.\n- ""OKAPI"": not ending with ER.\n- ""OLDER"": L banned.\n- ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a word? It\'s a card game. But we can consider.\n- ""ONCER"": N banned.\n- ""ORBED"": O R B E D -> but R at position 2? We know R is at position 5? So if we put R at 2, we know it\'s wrong? But in ""orbed"", R is at 2? So we would get minus? But we are trying to find the word? So we should avoid known wrong positions? So ""ORBED"" has R at 2? Which is not allowed? So invalid for our purpose? Because we know R is not at 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""ORDER"" has R at 2? Invalid.\n\n""OTHER"" we already tried.\n\n""OTTER"": O T T E R -> T banned and duplicate T? Invalid.\n\n""OUPHE"": not a word? and ends with E? but not R at 5.\n\n""OVERT"": as above, doesn\'t fit.\n\n""OWLER"": O W L E R -> L banned.\n\n""OXTER"": O X T E R -> T banned.\n\n""OZIER"": not common? and Z? But we haven\'t banned Z? But let\'s see: O Z I E R? I and Z? But is it a word? ""Ozier"" is a surname? Not common.\n\nSo, after this, the only common word I can think of is ""OFFER"".\n\nBut ""OFFER"" has duplicate F? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""UMPER""? not starting with O.\n\nWe need O at the beginning.\n\n""OAKUM"": not ending with ER.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKER"" is not valid? But let\'s search for more.\n\n""OAKER"" is not in the dictionary? But we can try ""OKRA"" but not 5 letters.\n\nAnother: ""OLEIC""? not ending with ER.\n\nPerhaps ""OUBIT""? not.\n\nI think ""OFFER"" is the most common word that fits: O F F E R.\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has duplicate F? We don\'t know? But we can try.\n\nBut we have banned letters: we must avoid C,A,N,L,S,T,H.\n\nF is not banned? So it\'s allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""OMMER""? not a word.\n\nOr ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""OGEED""? not.\n\n""OGRES"": but S banned? and L not? S is banned? From guess 2, S is not in the word? So invalid.\n\n""OGRES"" has S? No, ""ogres"" is O G R E S? S at 5? But S is banned? So invalid.\n\n""OGRED"" is O G R E D? But R at position 3? But we need R at position 5? In ""ogred"", R is at 3? But we have E at 4 and D at 5? But we need R at 5? So not matching.\n\nWe need R at 5? So the word must end with R? So ""ogred"" ends with D? Not R.\n\nSo not.\n\n""OILED"": L banned.\n\nI think we have to go with ""OFFER"" or ""OMBER"" or ""OBIER"".\n\nBut ""offer"" is more common.\n\nAnother common word: ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\n""OZONE"": O Z O N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\n""OPERA"": O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is the best bet.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the structure: O F F E R\n\n- Position 1: O (correct, we know)\n- Position 2: F (new)\n- Position 3: F (duplicate F)\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R (correct)\n\nWe are testing F? And if there is a duplicate F.\n\nIf the word is ""OFFER"", then we get it.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on F.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses? This is the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""OAKED""? A banned.\n\n""OWLED"": L banned.\n\n""OARED"": A banned.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing a common word.\n\nAnother word: ""OUBIT""? not.\n\n""OFLET""? not a word.\n\n""OAKUM""? not.\n\nPerhaps ""OAKER"" is accepted? But I doubt.\n\nIn Wordle, ""offer"" is a common word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""OFFER"".\n\nBut we have to consider: if the secret word has no duplicates, then ""OFFER"" is not the word? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nAlternatively, is there a word with two different letters?\n\nFor example, ""OBIER"": O B I E R? B and I? Is ""obier"" a word? It might be a proper noun? Not common.\n\n""OMMER"": not.\n\n""OUNCE"": invalid.\n\n""OCTET"": O C T E T -> C and T banned? And E at 4? But C and T are banned? So invalid.\n\n""OPERA"": A banned.\n\n""OPINE"": O P I N E -> N banned and E at 5? Not 4.\n\nNot.\n\n""ORATE"": O R A T E -> R at 2? Not allowed? A and T banned.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, I think ""OFFER"" is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""OFFER"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  - C (x): Not in the word.  \n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  \n  - A (x): Not in the word.  \n  - N (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (-): In the word, but not in position 5.  \n  - **Deductions**: The word contains R and E (but not at positions 2 or 5), and excludes C, A, N.\n\n- **Guess 2: roles**  \n  - R (-): In the word, but not in position 1.  \n  - O (-): In the word, but not in position 2.  \n  - L (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4.  \n  - S (x): Not in the word.  \n  - **Deductions**: E is fixed at position 4. R cannot be in positions 1 or 2. O cannot be in position 2. The word excludes L and S. Structure: `_ _ _ E _`.\n\n- **Guess 3: other**  \n  - O (✓): Correct and in position 1.  \n  - T (x): Not in the word.  \n  - H (x): Not in the word.  \n  - E (✓): Correct and in position 4 (confirmed).  \n  - R (✓): Correct and in position 5.  \n  - **Deductions**: The word starts with O, ends with R, and has E in position 4. Structure: `O _ _ E R`. Excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - Position 1: O  \n  - Position 4: E  \n  - Position 5: R  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H (not in the word).  \n- **Included letters (but positions unknown)**: Only O, E, R are confirmed; no new letters are known for positions 2/3.  \n- **Possible letters for positions 2 and 3**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter not excluded).  \n- **Word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- We need to guess a word that fits `O _ _ E R` and uses only allowed letters.  \n- Prioritize common words that test high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, D, M, P) to maximize information.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and positions (e.g., no R in position 1/2, no O in position 2).  \n- **Top candidate: ""OFFER""**  \n  - Fits `O _ _ E R` with O at 1, E at 4, R at 5.  \n  - Tests F (a common letter) in positions 2 and 3 (duplicate F is possible; we haven\'t ruled out duplicates).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, L, S, T, H).  \n  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on F will reveal if it\'s in the word and its position(s).  \n- **Why not other words?**  \n  - ""OAKER"": Contains A (excluded).  \n  - ""OBIER"": Uncommon/obscure word; less ideal.  \n  - ""ORDER"": Places R in position 2 (known to be incorrect from Guess 1).  \n  - ""OUTER"": Contains T (excluded).  \n  - ""OTHER"": Already guessed.  \n\n""OFFER"" is a valid Wordle word and efficiently tests the remaining possibilities.\n\n<guess>offer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roles -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) L(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: other -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) T(x) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: offer -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from the fourth guess ""offer"":\n O(✓) F(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\n This means:\n - O at position 1 is correct (already known).\n - F is not in the word at all? Both F\'s are marked \'x\'. So F is not in the word.\n - E at position 4 is correct (known).\n - R at position 5 is correct (known).\n\n So the word remains: O ? ? E R\n\n And we now know that F is not in the word.\n\n Previously, we have banned letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.\n\n The word must be O followed by two letters, then E and R.\n\n The two middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.\n\n We have not tried: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z, and some others.\n\n We must form a valid English word.\n\n Common words that fit O ? ? E R:\n\n - ""OAKER"": not valid (and A is banned).\n - ""OBIER"": O B I E R -> B and I? Not common, but possible.\n - ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? And D is not banned? But ""odder"" is a word (meaning more odd). But duplicate.\n - ""OGLER"": but L banned -> invalid.\n - ""OILER"": L banned -> invalid.\n - ""OMBER"": O M B E R -> M and B? ""Omber"" is a card game variant. Not common, but accepted in word games.\n - ""ONCER"": N banned -> invalid.\n - ""OUBET""? not a word.\n - ""OUNCE"": N banned? and C banned? So invalid.\n - ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.\n\n But note: ""offer"" had two F\'s and both were wrong? So F is entirely banned? So we must avoid F.\n\n Also, we have not tried D, G, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\n Let\'s list possible words without the banned letters:\n\n - ""OBIER"": O-B-I-E-R -> banned? B and I are allowed? But is it a word? Not in common use.\n - ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.\n - ""OCTET"": C and T banned -> invalid.\n - ""ODDER"": O-D-D-E-R -> duplicates D? But allowed? And D not banned? \n - ""OPERA"": A banned -> invalid.\n - ""OTHER"": already tried -> invalid.\n - ""OTTER"": T banned -> invalid.\n - ""OUNCE"": N and C banned -> invalid.\n\n Another: ""OGEES"": O-G-E-E-S -> but S banned? and duplicate E? Also E at position 3? Not 4. And we need position 4 to be E? So structure is fixed? Must be O ?? E R? So we cannot change the positions of E and R.\n\n So we need both positions 4 and 5 to be E and R respectively.\n\n Therefore, the word must be O [letter1] [letter2] E R.\n\n With banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F.\n\n So possible letters for position 2 and 3: B,D,G,I,K,M,P,U,V,W,Y,Z.\n\n We need a combination that forms a word.\n\n Common options:\n - ""ORDER"": O-R-D-E-R -> R at position 2? But we know R is at position 5? And R at 2 would be duplicate? Also, in ""crane"", R was at 2 and marked minus? So R cannot be at position 2? So invalid? Because position 5 R is already fixed? So we cannot put R at 2? Therefore, no duplicate R? Probably? But we don\'t know? However, we know R is at 5? And one R? So if the secret word has only one R, then position 2 cannot be R? But if it has two R\'s? Then R at 2 might be possible? But in ""crane"" we had R at 2 and got minus? So meaning that if there were two R\'s, having R at 2 might get a minus if one of the R\'s is at the correct position? It\'s ambiguous? But to be safe, we should avoid putting R at 2? Because we already know R is not at 2? We should try a word without R in position 2? So ""ORDER"" is not suitable? Because it has R at 2.\n\n But let\'s consider: the secret word is O ?? E R? And if it were ""ORDER"", it would be O R D E R? Then:\n   Position 1: O (correct)\n   Position 2: R (this would be a duplicate? But if we get feedback: R is present but not at position 2? That\'s what we got in ""crane""? But in ""other"", we got R at position 5 correct? And if the word has two R\'s? Then position 2 R might still be present? So we could get a minus for R at position 2? But we already know R is present? So it wouldn\'t tell us nothing new? Moreover, we would get for position 2: minus? Which we already know? So we are wasting a chance to test new letters? Therefore, we should not use ""ORDER"".\n\n Similarly, avoid words with letters we already tested? We need to test new letters.\n\n So let\'s focus on words with two new letters? Like:\n\n - ""OBIER"": O B I E R? -> B and I? Is it a word? I think ""Oubier"" is a French word? But in English, it might not be accepted? Not common.\n\n - ""ODDER"": O D D E R? -> This has D twice? And we can test D? If ""ODDER"" is the word? Or we get information about D? But it\'s a valid word? Meaning ""more odd"".\n\n - ""OMBER"": O M B E R? -> M and B? We haven\'t tested M or B? So we get information.\n\n - ""OPTER"": O P T E R? -> but T is banned? So invalid.\n\n - ""OUNCE"": invalid.\n\n - ""OOGER""?: not a word.\n\n Another: ""OWLER"": L banned -> invalid.\n\n ""OAKUM"": doesn\'t fit? A banned anyway.\n\n ""OAVES"": not a word? A banned.\n\n ""OBITS"": S banned -> invalid.\n\n ""OGIVE"": O G I V E? but E at position 5? Not 4? In the word, E must be at 4? So ""ogive"" is O-G-I-V-E? -> E at 5? Not allowed? Because E must be at 4? So we cannot use.\n\n So the options are limited.\n\n Let\'s consider ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".\n\n ""ODDER"": \n   - Uses duplicate D? But D not banned? \n   - We test D? If D is in the word? If it is, we would get:\n        Letter D at position 2 and 3? If D is in the word, and duplicated, we might get minuses? But we don\'t know the positions? Or it could be correct? \n\n ""OMBER"": \n   - M and B? New? \n\n Which is more common? ""ODDER"" is a valid word? But ""OMBER"" is more obscure? In Wordle, common words are prioritized.\n\n But we can search for more words:\n\n We need O??ER \n   Excluding: A,C,N,L,S,T,H,F\n\n We can try:\n   B: can be at position 2 or 3? For example: O B _ E R? \n\n   Words: ""OBIER"" (if accepted), or with G: O G ? E R? \n   O G E not common? \n\n   With D: O D _ E R? ""order"" has R? So ""odder""\n\n   With M: O M _ E R? Can be ""omber"" if we allow B? That is: \'omber\' -> O M B E R? So positions: O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n\n   So ""OMBER"" is O M B E R.\n\n   Similarly, O P _ E R? What words?: ""opera"" is O P E R A -> A banned and E at 3? Not 4? ""OPPER""? not a word? ""OPTER"" has T banned? ""Ouped""? not.\n\n   O U _ E R? ""oufer""? F banned? ""Ouser""? S banned? ""Ouwer""? not a word.\n\n   O K _ E R? ""okker""? not? ""oaker""? A banned.\n\n   O G _ E R? ""ogger""? not? ""ogre"" is 4 letters? \n\n   So no.\n\n Therefore, we have:\n   ""OBIER"": if allowed? Or ""OMBER"", or ""ODDER"".\n\n We also have ""OAKER"", but A banned.\n\n Another: ""OILER"": L banned.\n\n Perhaps ""OVERT"" doesn\'t match.\n\n After consideration, ""OUNCE"" is invalid.\n\n Also, ""OWE"" variations don\'t work.\n\n So among ""ODDER"", ""OMBER"", and ""OBIER"".\n\n We can try ""OUNCE"" but N banned.\n\n Another word: ""OAKES"" S banned.\n\n Perhaps ""OSIER"": L? OSIER is a type of willow? But S and I? And S is banned? So invalid.\n\n Another: ""OATER"": A banned.\n\n I think the valid words are:\n   - ""ODDER"": valid word? Yes, and no banned letters? O,D,E,R. In ""odder"", the letter D at position 2 and 3? So duplicate D? And E at 4 and R at 5? And O at 1? So it fits? It means more odd? Comparative of odd? Or a person who plows? Archaic? But accepted in dictionaries.\n\n   - ""OMBER"": a card game? Accepted? Might be in the word bank.\n\n   - ""OBIER"": not common? Not in all dictionaries? So less likely.\n\n   - ""ONCER"": N banned.\n\n   - ""OKIER"": not a word? \n\n So I think we should choose between ""ODDER"" and ""OMBER"".\n\n We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? We must try one.\n\n We have two guesses left? We are on the fifth guess.\n\n Let\'s pick ""ODDER"" because it is more common?\n\n But ""OMBER"" might be just as valid.\n\n But we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have duplicates? Then we test two different letters? But we don\'t have many words.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of words like ""OPTER""? T banned.\n\n ""OUTER"": T banned.\n\n ""OUBER""?: not.\n\n I think we have to use either ""OMBER"" or ""ODDER"".\n\n Let\'s choose ""OMBER"" first? Because it tests two new letters: M and B? Rather than duplicate D.\n\n But ""ODDER"" tests D? But only one new letter? Because D is replicated? So if D is in the word, it must be duplicated? So we get less information? Whereas ""OMBER"" tests both M and B? So if we get minuses or x for both, we know they are not in the word.\n\n So ""OMBER"" might be better? It tests M at position 2 and B at position 3? Both new.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll choose ""OMBER"".\n\n But is it in Wordle\'s word list? We can assume it is? Or use a safer word? Is there a safer word?\n\n Another: ""OAKUM"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n So I think ""OMBER"" is valid.\n\n We can try ""OPERA""? Not? A banned.\n\n Or ""OWE""? Not 5 letters.\n\n So: guess ""OMBER"".\n\n But in ""OMBER"", we have O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So matches the structure.\n\n And banned letters: C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F are avoided.\n\n So it\'s a valid guess.\n\n Therefore, guessed word is ""OMBER"".\n\n But let\'s double-check:\n\n Guess: ""omber""\n   If the word is ""omber"", then we get it right? If not, then we get feedback on M and B? Which is useful for the last guess.\n\n Alternatively, if we try ""odder"", and it\'s not the word? Then we know D is duplicated? But we don\'t have D in other letters? So not so useful? Whereas ""omber"" gives info on two distinct letters.\n\n So better.### Analysis of Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  - Excluded: C, A, N.  \n  - R and E are in the word (wrong positions).  \n- **Guess 2: roles**  \n  - Excluded: L, S.  \n  - Confirmed: E is at position 4 (✓).  \n  - R is not in position 1, O is not in position 2.  \n- **Guess 3: other**  \n  - Excluded: T, H.  \n  - Confirmed: O is at position 1 (✓), E is at position 4 (✓), R is at position 5 (✓).  \n  - **Word structure: O _ _ E R**.  \n- **Guess 4: offer**  \n  - Excluded: F.  \n  - Confirmed: O (✓), E (✓), R (✓) positions remain unchanged.  \n  - Feedback for F: Both occurrences are ""x"" → **F is not in the word**.\n\n### Current Deductions:\n- **Secret word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F.  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n- **Available letters**: B, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 5:\n- The goal is to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the allowed pool that form valid English words.  \n- Prioritize testing **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., M, B, D) to maximize information.  \n- Candidate: **""OMBER""**  \n  - Fits `O _ _ E R` → O at 1, M at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5.  \n  - Tests M (position 2) and B (position 3), both new and common letters.  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters.  \n  - If correct, it solves the puzzle.

We now have feedback from the fifth guess ""omber"": 
  O(✓) M(x) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- O at position 1 is correct (known).
- M is not in the word (x).
- B is not in the word (x).
- E at position 4 is correct (known).
- R at position 5 is correct (known).

So the word remains: O ? ? E R

We need to find which letters fill positions 2 and 3.

Previously, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F, M, B.

We have no information about positions 2 and 3 except that they must be letters not in the excluded list.

The word must be a valid English word of the form O _ _ E R.

We have used the fifth guess and have one more left.

We must consider the letters that are not banned and form a word.

Banned letters: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F, M, B.

So allowed letters: D, G, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Possible words:

- ""ODDER"": O D D E R -> duplicate D? But D is allowed? Yes, and ""odder"" is a word? Meaning more odd? Or a type of otter? But we already tried ""omber""? And ""odder"" uses D twice? But we haven't tested D? So we can try.

- ""OKER""? O K E R? But E must be at position 4? So we need a letter at position 3? So ""oker"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

- ""OGRE"": 4 letters.

- ""OTHER"": already tried.

- ""OPERA"": A banned -> invalid.

- ""OAKER"": A banned -> invalid.

- ""OBIER"": B banned? But in guess 5, B is x? So eliminated? And not common? 

- ""OUNCE"": N and C banned -> invalid.

- ""OULET""? Not a word? 

- ""OUTER"": T banned -> invalid.

- ""OWE"": not 5.

- ""OFLET""? Not word.

- ""ODLER""? L banned -> invalid.

- ""ODGER""? G? But is ""odger"" a word? Not common.

- ""OGIVE"": E at 5? Not 4 -> invalid.

- ""OUBIT""? Not word.

- ""OILLET""? L banned.

After considering, the only common word left is ""ODDER""? 

Or ""OPTER""? T banned? And P? But T is banned? So ""opider""? Not word.

Another: ""OLEIN""? L banned? 

""OUBET""? Not.

Perhaps ""OWARE""? But W? and E at 5? Not 4.

""OGRED"": R at 3? And E at 4? But G and D? But ""ogred"" is O G R E D? Then R at position 3? But we have R at position 5? So duplicate R? But in the secret word, we have R at position 5. So position 3 cannot be R? Because we don't know if duplicates exist? But in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got minus? If the word had R at position 3? It would have been indicated? But it wasn't? Because we haven't tested position 3 for R?

Actually, the secret word has R at position 5, and only one? R? But we don't know? It could have multiple R's? So R could be at position 3? But in ""omber"", we didn't test R at position 3? We had B? So position 3 is unknown? 

In ""omber"", we had B at position 3, which is not R? So we didn't test position 3 for R? 

Therefore, a word like ""OGRED"" would be O G R E D? 
  Position 1: O (correct)
  Position 2: G
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: E (correct)
  Position 5: D? But R is known to be at position 5? So if position 5 is D? Then R cannot be there? Contradiction? 

But we know the secret word has R at position 5? So position 5 is R? Therefore, position 3 cannot be R? Because it's a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? If allowed, then R could be at position 3 and 5? Then we would get a minus for R at 3? And a check for R at 5? But in ""crane"", when we guessed R at position 2? We got minus? Meaning R is not present at position 2? But it was present elsewhere? 

So let's avoid duplicating R? Because we don't know? We can test? But we have only one more guess? 

But the secret word has R at 5? Why would we put R at position 3? That's unnecessary? And likely wrong? 

Moreover, we have not tested G and D? So ""OGRED"" would be a valid test? But position 5 is D? But the secret word has position 5 as R? So unless we misremember, position 5 is R? Fixed? So ""OGRED"" ends with D? Not R? Therefore, it cannot be? Because the secret word ends with R? So any guess must end with R? So we cannot use ""OGRED""?? 

Any guess must match the positions we know? In particular, position 5 must be R? Position 4 E? Position 1 O? Because we have confirmed them? 

Therefore, the word must end with E R? So ""ogred"" would be ... E D? Not ER? So incorrect? 

Therefore, it must be O ?? E R? 

So ""OGRED"" is O G R E D? Which doesn't end with ER? It ends with ED? So not? 

We need the last two letters to be E and then R? So "" ...ER"" 

Now, another word: ""OSIER""? But S banned? and L banned? 

""OUNCE"": invalid.

""OVINE"": O V I N E -> N banned? and E at 5? Not 4.

Not.

""OAKED"": A banned.

""OPING"": O P I N G -> N banned? and not ends with ER.

Not.

So then, only ""ODDER""? O D D E R? 

Also, we have ""OAKED""? A banned.

Perhaps ""OWEER""? Not a word? 

I think ""ODDER"" is the only common word that fits? 

So we have to guess ""ODDER"". 

If it's not ""ODDER"", then we might lose? But we don't know? 

But let's list the letters we haven't tried for positions 2 and 3: 

D, G, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

We need a combination, like two letters that form a valid word? 

For example, 
- ""O G E R?"" no? 
- ""ODDER"": uses D twice? 
- ""O D G E R"" but 6 letters? No? 
- ""O D E R?"" but we need 5 letters? O, then two letters, then E R? 

Therefore, the missing letters are two: one at position 2 and one at position 3? 

Words:
- ""OBIER"": B banned -> no? 
- ""OUBER""? Not a word? 
- ""ONGER""? N banned? 
- ""OIKER""? O I K E R? I and K? Is it a word? Meaning a goading hit in baseball? Obscure? 
- ""OLDER"": L banned -> no? 
- ""ONCER"": N banned -> no? 
- ""ONDER""? N banned? 
- ""OPIER""? O P I E R? ""opier"" is a noun meaning one who copies? Uncommon? 
- ""ORDER"": R at 2? And we know R position is 5? So duplicate? Probably not? 
- ""OTHER"": tried? 
- ""OTTER"": T banned -> no? 
- ""OUFED""? F banned -> no? 
- ""OUPED""? not a word? 
- ""OUTER"": T banned -> no? 
- ""OWLER"": L banned -> no? 
- ""OWNER"": W and N? N banned -> no? 
- ""OYER"": not 5 letters? 

After careful thought, ""ODDER"" and ""OPIER"" are possibilities? But ""opier"" is rare? 

Also, ""OKE"" not 5? 

So I think ""ODDER"" is the best choice? Because it is a valid word? 

But let's not forget ""OAKED"" is invalid. 

Perhaps ""OARED"": A banned? 

Another: ""OEDES"": O E D E S -> not O??ER? 

So, I deduce that ""ODDER"" is the word? Or if not, we lost? 

But we have to guess? 

So guess ""ODDER"". 

But let's double-check banned letters: banned is C,A,N,L,S,T,H,F,M,B? D is not banned? So we can use D? 

Therefore, guessed word is ""ODDER"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - Excluded: C, A, N.  
  - R and E are in the word (wrong positions).  
- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - Excluded: L, S.  
  - Confirmed: E is at position 4 (✓).  
  - R is not in position 1, O is not in position 2.  
- **Guess 3: other**

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F, M, B.  
- **Available letters for positions 2 and 3**: D, G, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Valid words must fit `O _ _ E R` while avoiding excluded letters. Common words like ""ODDER"" (tested below) are prioritized.  

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess):
- **Candidate: ""ODDER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` → O at 1, D at 2 and 3 (duplicate), E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - **Why ""ODDER""?**  
    - It is a valid English word (comparative of ""odd"" or archaic term for someone who plows).  
    - No other common words exist (e.g., ""OAKER"" uses A, banned; ""OBIER"" uses B, excluded; ""OPIER"" is obscure).  
- **Duplicates**: We haven't ruled out duplicate letters (no evidence against them in prior guesses).  
- If ""ODDER"" is incorrect, we lose, but it is the last remaining logical guess.

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  - Excluded: C, A, N.  
  - R and E are in the word (wrong positions).  
- **Guess 2: roles**  
  - Excluded: L, S.  
  - Confirmed: E is at position 4 (✓).  
  - R is not in position 1, O is not in position 2.  
- **Guess 3: other**  
  - Excluded: T, H.  
  - Confirmed: O at position 1 (✓), E at position 4 (✓), R at position 5 (✓).  
  - Structure: `O _ _ E R`.  
- **Guess 4: offer**  
  - Excluded: F.  
  - Confirmed: O (✓), E (✓), R (✓) unchanged.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure**: `O _ _ E R`.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, L, S, T, H, F, M, B.  
- **Available letters for positions 2 and 3**: D, G, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
- **Remaining possibilities**: Valid words must fit `O _ _ E R` while avoiding excluded letters. Common words like ""ODDER"" (tested below) are prioritized.  

### Strategy for Guess 6 (Final Guess):
- **Candidate: ""ODDER""**  
  - Fits `O _ _ E R` → O at 1, D at 2 and 3 (duplicate), E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
  - **Why ""ODDER""?**  
    - It is a valid English word (comparative of ""odd"" or archaic term for someone who plows).  
    - No other common words exist (e.g., ""OAKER"" uses A, banned; ""OBIER"" uses B, excluded; ""OPIER"" is obscure).  
- **Duplicates**: We haven't ruled out duplicate letters (no evidence against them in prior guesses).  
- If ""ODDER"" is incorrect, we lose, but it is the last remaining logical guess.",Guess 6: odder -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) D(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
