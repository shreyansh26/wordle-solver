We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback from previous guesses.
The goal is to maximize information gain. We want to guess a word that includes common letters and has as many distinct letters as possible to cover a broad set.

Common English vowels and consonants: vowels are A, E, I, O, U; common consonants include R, S, T, N, etc.

A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRATE"" because it contains the common letters C, R, A, T, E. However, let me consider another word with distinct letters and common letters.

Another candidate might be ""ROAST"" but it has two 'S's? No, it's R,O,A,S,T -> all distinct.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a common starter.

But note: we are allowed 6 tries and at the first guess we haven't received any feedback.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good coverage.

Another candidate is ""SOARE"" (which is a bird, valid in some dictionaries) but might be less common.

Let me check: for maximum coverage, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

We can choose a word that includes as many of these as possible.

Possible choices: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if valid, but it might not be common).

RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. These are all very common.

So, I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But wait, is ""RAISE"" a valid five-letter word? Yes.

So, let me output accordingly.

For the first guess, I selected a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and distinct letters to cover a broad range. Common letters like vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S) appear frequently in 5-letter words. ""RAISE"" uses five distinct letters, all common in English, which helps test multiple positions at once and increases the chances of receiving useful feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the secret word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". In ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, and S cannot be at position 4.
- The letters A, I, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and S (each at least once, but we don't know about duplicates yet).
- Does not include A, I, E.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Includes R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they must be in other positions).
- Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R and S are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be at position 1, it can be at 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, S cannot be at position 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, for now, we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

We also need to avoid A, I, E.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also have vowels: O and U (and sometimes Y) are still possible.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

For example, words like: ""roast"", but ""roast"" has A and we know A is absent. So not allowed.

Another: ""rusts"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are present. Also, we want to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information? Actually, we can use duplicates to test, but it might be less informative.

But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for R.

However, to keep it simple, let's try a word with R and S and without A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""story"" -> S at position 1, T, O, R, Y. But in our feedback, S was at position 4 and was wrong, but now we put S at position 1. That's allowed because we don't know if position 1 is correct for S. Similarly, R was at position 1 in the first guess and now we put it at position 4. But note: we know R is in the word but not at position 1, so position 4 might be possible.

But ""story"" has O and Y, which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""crown"" but no S and we need to include S? We must include R and S? Actually, we don't have to, but it's beneficial because we know they are in the word. By including them, we can get their positions.

We know R and S are present, so we should use them to find their correct positions.

So, let's try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (not A, I, E) to test.

Possible words: 
- ""syrup"" -> S at 1, Y, R, U, P. But U is a vowel. This is acceptable.
- ""pours"" -> P, O, U, R, S. S is at position 5, which is different from position 4 (which was wrong in the first guess). And R is at position 4, which is not position 1.

But we have to avoid A, I, E. ""pours"" doesn't have them.

Another: ""torus"" -> T, O, R, U, S. S at position 5.

But let me check if these are valid words.

We can also consider: ""storm"" -> S, T, O, R, M. This has S at 1 and R at 4. We know from first guess that R cannot be at 1 and S cannot be at 4. In ""storm"", S is at 1 (which we don't know about) and R is at 4 (which we don't know about). So this is a good candidate.

Also, ""storm"" uses O and T and M, which are common.

Another candidate: ""scorn"" -> S, C, O, R, N. Similarly, S at 1, R at 4.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting S at position 1. That's fine because we are testing a new position.

Similarly, R was at position 1 and now we put it at position 4.

We can also consider words where R and S are in other positions.

For example, put R at position 2 and S at position 3? Like ""crisp"" but C, R, I, S, P -> but I is absent, so we cannot use I.

Avoid I.

So, ""crops"" -> C, R, O, P, S. S at position 5. This is also good.

But ""crops"" has S at 5, which is different from 4.

We can also try ""dross"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present. It might be less informative.

So, to maximize new letters, we should avoid duplicates in our guess.

Therefore, I think ""storm"" is a good choice: it has S, T, O, R, M. All distinct and common letters.

Similarly, ""proud"" but no S? We need S.

Another: ""short"" -> S, H, O, R, T. S at 1, R at 4. Same as ""storm"".

But ""short"" has H and T, which are also common.

But ""storm"" has M, which is less common? But still acceptable.

We can also consider ""snort"" -> S, N, O, R, T.

But let me choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a valid and common word.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: we are going to test S at position 1 and R at position 4. Also, we test T, O, M.

If we get feedback, we can know about these positions.

Alternatively, we could put R in a different position. For example, we know R is not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 2,3,5. Similarly for S: not at 4, but we haven't tested 1,2,3,5.

In ""storm"", we test S at 1 and R at 4.

But we also test O at 3 and M at 5.

Another idea: we could test R at position 2 and S at position 1? For example, ""shrug"" -> S, H, R, U, G. But then we don't test many vowels? But we know E and I are absent, so U and O are the remaining vowels.

But ""shrug"" is a valid word.

However, I think ""storm"" is fine.

Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Common letters left: O, T, N, L, etc.

Another word: ""store"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

""store"" has E, which is absent. So invalid.

""story"" -> S, T, O, R, Y. Y is at the end. This is also good.

But Y is less common? But it's acceptable.

I think ""storm"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: ""storm""

But note: we must ensure that the word does not have A, I, E. ""storm"" has S, T, O, R, M. No A, I, E. Good.

Also, R is at position 4 (which was position 4 in the first guess was S, but now R is at 4). We don't know if position 4 is correct for R.

Similarly, S is at position 1.

We are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""storm"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R and S (since they are in the word), but avoid placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Exclude A, I, and E.
- Test new common letters (like T, O, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""storm"" fits these criteria:
- S is at position 1 (a new position, not 4).
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 1).
- It includes new letters T, O, and M, which are common and untested.
- It avoids A, I, and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of R and S while testing three additional letters.

<guess>storm</guess>",storm,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the secret word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". In ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, and S cannot be at position 4.
- The letters A, I, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and S (each at least once, but we don't know about duplicates yet).
- Does not include A, I, E.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be at position 1, it can be at 2,3,4,5.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""story"" -> S at position 1, T, O, R, Y. But in our feedback, S was at position 4 and was wrong, but now we put S at position 1. That's allowed because we don't know if position 1 is correct for S. Similarly, R was at position 1 in the first guess and now we put it at position 4. But note: we know R is in the word but not at position 1, so position 4 might be possible.

But ""story"" has O and Y, which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""crown"" but no S and we need to include S? We must include R and S? Actually, we don't have to, but it's beneficial because we know they are in the word. By including them, we can get their positions.

We know R and S are present, so we should use them to find their correct positions.

So, let's try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (not A, I, E) to test.

- ""pours"" -> P, O, U, R, S. S is at position 5, which is different from position 4 (which was wrong in the first guess). And R is at position 4, which is not position 1.

But we have to avoid A, I, E. ""pours"" doesn't have them.

Another: ""torus"" -> T, O, R, U, S. S at position 5.

But let me check if these are valid words.

We can also consider: ""storm"" -> S, T, O, R, M. This has S at 1 and R at 4. We know from first guess that R cannot be at 1 and S cannot be at 4. In ""storm"", S is at 1 (which we don't know about) and R is at 4 (which we don't know about). So this is a good candidate.

Also, ""storm"" uses O and T and M, which are common.

Another candidate: ""scorn"" -> S, C, O, R, N. Similarly, S at 1, R at 4.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting S at position 1. That's fine because we are testing a new position.

Similarly, R was at position 1 and now we put it at position 4.

We can also consider words where R and S are in other positions.

For example, put R at position 2 and S at position 3? Like ""crisp"" but C, R, I, S, P -> but I is absent, so we cannot use I.

Avoid I.

So, ""crops"" -> C, R, O, P, S. S at position 5. This is also good.

But ""crops"" has S at 5, which is different from 4.

We can also try ""dross"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present. It might be less informative.

So, to maximize new letters, we should avoid duplicates in our guess.

Therefore, I think ""storm"" is a good choice: it has S, T, O, R, M. All distinct and common letters.

Similarly, ""proud"" but no S? We need S.

Another: ""short"" -> S, H, O, R, T. S at 1, R at 4. Same as ""storm"".

But ""storm"" has M, which is less common? But still acceptable.

We can also consider ""snort"" -> S, N, O, R, T.

But let me choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a valid and common word.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: we are going to test S at position 1 and R at position 4. Also, we test T, O, M.

If we get feedback, we can know about these positions.

Alternatively, we could put R in a different position. For example, we know R is not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 2,3,5. Similarly for S: not at 4, but we haven't tested 1,2,3,5.

In ""storm"", we test S at 1 and R at 4.

But we also test O at 3 and M at 5.

""store"" has E, which is absent. So invalid.

""story"" -> S, T, O, R, Y. Y is at the end. This is also good.

But Y is less common? But it's acceptable.

I think ""storm"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: ""storm""

But note: we must ensure that the word does not have A, I, E. ""storm"" has S, T, O, R, M. No A, I, E. Good.

Also, R is at position 4 (which was position 4 in the first guess was S, but now R is at 4). We don't know if position 4 is correct for R.

Similarly, S is at position 1.

We are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""storm"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R and S (since they are in the word), but avoid placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Exclude A, I, and E.
- Test new common letters (like T, O, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""storm"" fits these criteria:
- S is at position 1 (a new position, not 4).
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 1).
- It includes new letters T, O, and M, which are common and untested.
- It avoids A, I, and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of R and S while testing three additional letters.",Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) R(✓) M(x),FAIL

The goal is to maximize information gain. We want to guess a word that includes common letters and has as many distinct letters as possible to cover a broad set.

Common English vowels and consonants: vowels are A, E, I, O, U; common consonants include R, S, T, N, etc.

A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRATE"" because it contains the common letters C, R, A, T, E. However, let me consider another word with distinct letters and common letters.

Another candidate might be ""ROAST"" but it has two 'S's? No, it's R,O,A,S,T -> all distinct.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a common starter.

But note: we are allowed 6 tries and at the first guess we haven't received any feedback.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good coverage.

Another candidate is ""SOARE"" (which is a bird, valid in some dictionaries) but might be less common.

Let me check: for maximum coverage, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

We can choose a word that includes as many of these as possible.

Possible choices: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if valid, but it might not be common).

RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. These are all very common.

So, I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But wait, is ""RAISE"" a valid five-letter word? Yes.

So, let me output accordingly.For the first guess, I selected a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and distinct letters to cover a broad range. Common letters like vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S) appear frequently in 5-letter words. ""RAISE"" uses five distinct letters, all common in English, which helps test multiple positions at once and increases the chances of receiving useful feedback.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the secret word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". In ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, and S cannot be at position 4.
- The letters A, I, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and S (each at least once, but we don't know about duplicates yet).
- Does not include A, I, E.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Includes R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they must be in other positions).
- Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R and S are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be at position 1, it can be at 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, S cannot be at position 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, for now, we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

We also need to avoid A, I, E.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also have vowels: O and U (and sometimes Y) are still possible.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

For example, words like: ""roast"", but ""roast"" has A and we know A is absent. So not allowed.

Another: ""rusts"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are present. Also, we want to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information? Actually, we can use duplicates to test, but it might be less informative.

But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for R.

However, to keep it simple, let's try a word with R and S and without A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""story"" -> S at position 1, T, O, R, Y. But in our feedback, S was at position 4 and was wrong, but now we put S at position 1. That's allowed because we don't know if position 1 is correct for S. Similarly, R was at position 1 in the first guess and now we put it at position 4. But note: we know R is in the word but not at position 1, so position 4 might be possible.

But ""story"" has O and Y, which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""crown"" but no S and we need to include S? We must include R and S? Actually, we don't have to, but it's beneficial because we know they are in the word. By including them, we can get their positions.

We know R and S are present, so we should use them to find their correct positions.

So, let's try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (not A, I, E) to test.

Possible words: 
- ""syrup"" -> S at 1, Y, R, U, P. But U is a vowel. This is acceptable.
- ""pours"" -> P, O, U, R, S. S is at position 5, which is different from position 4 (which was wrong in the first guess). And R is at position 4, which is not position 1.

But we have to avoid A, I, E. ""pours"" doesn't have them.

Another: ""torus"" -> T, O, R, U, S. S at position 5.

But let me check if these are valid words.

We can also consider: ""storm"" -> S, T, O, R, M. This has S at 1 and R at 4. We know from first guess that R cannot be at 1 and S cannot be at 4. In ""storm"", S is at 1 (which we don't know about) and R is at 4 (which we don't know about). So this is a good candidate.

Also, ""storm"" uses O and T and M, which are common.

Another candidate: ""scorn"" -> S, C, O, R, N. Similarly, S at 1, R at 4.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting S at position 1. That's fine because we are testing a new position.

Similarly, R was at position 1 and now we put it at position 4.

We can also consider words where R and S are in other positions.

For example, put R at position 2 and S at position 3? Like ""crisp"" but C, R, I, S, P -> but I is absent, so we cannot use I.

Avoid I.

So, ""crops"" -> C, R, O, P, S. S at position 5. This is also good.

But ""crops"" has S at 5, which is different from 4.

We can also try ""dross"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present. It might be less informative.

So, to maximize new letters, we should avoid duplicates in our guess.

Therefore, I think ""storm"" is a good choice: it has S, T, O, R, M. All distinct and common letters.

Similarly, ""proud"" but no S? We need S.

Another: ""short"" -> S, H, O, R, T. S at 1, R at 4. Same as ""storm"".

But ""short"" has H and T, which are also common.

But ""storm"" has M, which is less common? But still acceptable.

We can also consider ""snort"" -> S, N, O, R, T.

But let me choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a valid and common word.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: we are going to test S at position 1 and R at position 4. Also, we test T, O, M.

If we get feedback, we can know about these positions.

Alternatively, we could put R in a different position. For example, we know R is not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 2,3,5. Similarly for S: not at 4, but we haven't tested 1,2,3,5.

In ""storm"", we test S at 1 and R at 4.

But we also test O at 3 and M at 5.

Another idea: we could test R at position 2 and S at position 1? For example, ""shrug"" -> S, H, R, U, G. But then we don't test many vowels? But we know E and I are absent, so U and O are the remaining vowels.

But ""shrug"" is a valid word.

However, I think ""storm"" is fine.

Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Common letters left: O, T, N, L, etc.

Another word: ""store"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

""store"" has E, which is absent. So invalid.

""story"" -> S, T, O, R, Y. Y is at the end. This is also good.

But Y is less common? But it's acceptable.

I think ""storm"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: ""storm""

But note: we must ensure that the word does not have A, I, E. ""storm"" has S, T, O, R, M. No A, I, E. Good.

Also, R is at position 4 (which was position 4 in the first guess was S, but now R is at 4). We don't know if position 4 is correct for R.

Similarly, S is at position 1.

We are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""storm"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R and S (since they are in the word), but avoid placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Exclude A, I, and E.
- Test new common letters (like T, O, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""storm"" fits these criteria:
- S is at position 1 (a new position, not 4).
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 1).
- It includes new letters T, O, and M, which are common and untested.
- It avoids A, I, and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of R and S while testing three additional letters.

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. **Letters in secret word:**
   - S, O, R are confirmed (from ✓ in guess 2).
   - T is confirmed (from `-` in guess 2).
   - R was also in guess 1 but wrong position, which is consistent since now R is at position 4 and it's correct.

   - Position 2: ? (T is in the word but not at position 2)
   - Position 3: O (✓)
   - Position 4: R (✓)

   - A, I, E, M are not in the word (from `x` marks).
   - From guess 1, S is not at position 4 (which we now know is correct because in guess 2, S is at position 1 and ✓, and position 4 is R).

   We know T is in the word, but not at position 2. So where can T be? It must be at one of the unknown positions, but positions 1,3,4 are fixed. The only unknown positions are 2 and 5, and position 2 is already ruled out for T. Therefore, T must be at position 5? Wait, not necessarily because we have only two unknown positions: 2 and 5. Position 2 we know isn't T (from feedback on ""storm""). But T could be at position 5, or could it be elsewhere? Positions 1,3,4 are S,O,R respectively and fixed. T is not at position 2, so the only other possibility is position 5.

   However, we must remember that words may have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates, and T is a new letter. Also, from feedback, T is in the word and only position 5 is available besides 2. So T must be at position 5? But wait, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in this case, since we know T is present and not at position 2, and positions 1,3,4 are occupied by S,O,R. So if T is at position 5, that would work. But what if the word has T in an earlier position that we thought was fixed? But no, positions 1,3,4 are fixed and already known letters: S,O,R respectively. So T cannot be at position 1,3,4 because those are already S,O,R. And it's not at position 2. Therefore, T must be at position 5.

   So we can deduce that position 5 must be T? Wait, let me confirm:

   Secret word positions:
   1: S
   2: some letter (not T)
   3: O
   4: R
   5: must be T? Because T is in the word and can only go there.

   However, we must be cautious. But logically, there's no other position for T. Therefore, we can conclude that position 5 is T.

   So now the secret word is: S _ O R T

   With the blank at position 2.

5. **Position 2:**
   - We need to find a letter for position 2.
   - It cannot be any of the absent letters: A, I, E, M (from previous feedback).
   - Also, from guess 1: the word cannot have A, I, E. And in guess 2, M is absent. So absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   What other letters are possible? And we must form a valid English word of the form S_ORT.

   Common 5-letter words that match S_ORT: ? Let me think.

   - Short? But we know that ""short"" has H. And the feedback from previous guesses? We don't have feedback about H yet. But let us remember if H is excluded? From previous guesses, we have no information about H. Also, in guess 1, we had no H, and guess 2 was ""storm"" which has no H.

   - Possibilities: short, snort, sport, etc.

   But we have constraints: the secret word must contain the letters we've deduced: S, O, R, T and one more letter at position 2.

   Also, we must avoid the absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   Now, let's consider:

   - ""short"": S H O R T. H is a possible letter.
   - ""snort"": S N O R T. N is possible.
   - ""sport"": S P O R T. P is possible.
   - ""fort"" is 4 letters. ""sort"" is 4 letters.

   So candidates: short, snort, sport.

   How can we confirm?

   We have one more piece of information: from guess 1, the word had S and R, but in wrong positions. In ""short"": R is at position 4. In guess 1, we had R at position 1 and it was marked `-` (wrong position). But in the secret word ""short"", position 1 is S, not R, so that's consistent because R is at 4. Similarly for S: in guess 1, S was at position 4 and marked `-`, meaning it's not at 4. In ""short"", S is at position 1, so that's different and correct.

   Similarly for other words.

   But to decide which word to pick, we need to use the feedback to our advantage. We have only one unknown letter.

   Alternatively, we might guess one of these words to finish.

   But note, we have 6 total guesses, so we can try one.

   However, we want to be efficient.

   Let me see if we can utilize more information.

   In particular, from guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` meaning it is not at 1, which we already used. Similarly, the S at position 4 was marked `-` meaning not at 4. Now in our deduced form, S is at 1 and R is at 4, consistent.

   But is there any constraint from other letters? In guess 1, we had A,I,E absent, but not H, N, P, etc.

   So we have three candidates: short, snort, sport.

   To guess correctly, we could pick one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   But note: we haven't tested H, N, P.

   Also, from guess 2, we tested T and got `-` at position 2, but now we have T at position 5? Wait, we deduced that position 5 must be T. Then why in guess 2, T was at position 2 and marked `-`? Because in the secret word, T is at position 5, so indeed position 2 is wrong.

   So our deduction is correct: secret word is S, ?, O, R, T.

   Now, which letter for position 2?

   Without more information, we must guess among the possibilities.

   But we can make a guess that uses one of these letters to cover it.

   Alternatively, we could make a new guess that includes more untested letters? But we know four letters: S,O,R,T, so we are missing only one letter.

   Since we have only one unknown letter, it's better to guess one of the words to solve.

   Let me see: ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"" are all valid words.

   We have had no feedback about H, N, or P.

   Since we know the word ends with T (position 5), and pattern S_ORT.

   But we can try to think if there are other possibilities. For example, is there a word ""stort""? No, not English. Or ""scort""? Scort is not a word. We have common words: short, snort, sport.

   Another one: ""swort"" is not valid.

   So the possibilities are limited.

   Given we have guesses left, we can pick one.

   But note: in guess 1, we had R and S in wrong positions. But in these words, R is always at position 4 (fixed by second guess) and S at position 1, so no issue.

   How about the fact that in guess 2, we tested T at position 2 and got `-`, which is consistent with our deduction because T is at position 5.

   Now, to choose, we can think about frequency or make a strategic guess.

   Alternatively, we might use a word to test multiple options? But since we have only one unknown, we can guess any of them.

   I propose guessing ""short"" because it includes H, which is a common letter we haven't tested.

   Similarly, ""snort"" has N, ""sport"" has P.

   Since we don't know, and we want to solve, we can guess ""short"".

   But wait, we have three possibilities. What if we guess ""sort"" but that's 4 letters? No, it must be 5 letters.

   How about guessing ""scout""? But that has U and we don't have U? Also, our deduced word must have O at position 3 and R at position 4. ""scout"" is S C O U T, so positions: S, C, O, U, T. But if the secret word were ""scout"", we would have position 3: O (correct because we got ✓ for O in ""storm""), but position 4 would be U, not R. But we know position 4 is R (✓ from ""storm""), so that doesn't match. Therefore, ""scout"" cannot be because position 4 must be R.

   Similarly, any word must have S at 1, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

   So the only freedom is position 2.

   We need to guess the letter at position 2, which is one of H, P, N? Or others?

   Other possibilities: ""sport"" (P), ""short"" (H), ""snort"" (N), ""start"" but A is absent? ""start"" has T at the end and S at start? But ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T -> but A is absent? We know A is not in the word, so invalid. ""sturt"" is not a word. ""skort"" is a word? Meaning: skort (a skirt with shorts) -> S,K,O,R,T. K is a possibility. So K is also untested.

   We also have ""skort"". And ""spurt"" but then position 3 is U? And must be O? So ""spurt"" is S,P,U,R,T -> position 3 is U, but we must have O at position 3? Therefore, only words that have O at position 3 and R at position 4 and T at position 5.

   Therefore, more precisely, S?ORT.

   Words: short (H), sport (P), snort (N), skort (K), and perhaps more? 

   Also, ""sword"" but that's 5 letters? S W O R D -> ends with D, not T. No match: must end with T.

   Possible words: short, snort, sport, skort.

   So letters for position 2: H, N, P, K.

   Now, we have not tested H, N, P, K.

   How to decide? We can choose a word that uses one of these and see.

   Given we are on the third guess, we might as well guess one.

   I'll choose ""short"" because it's very common.

   Alternatively, we could use a guess to narrow down by choosing a word that tests multiple letters? But we only have one blank to fill. 

   Since we have to fill position 2, we cannot avoid testing only one letter per guess.

   So I'll guess ""short"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""short""

   But let me explain: from the deduction, we have the word as S?ORT with ? being a letter that is not A, I, E, M. Additionally, from the feedback, we know T must be at position 5 because it has to be somewhere and only that position is available. Thus, I am confirming by guessing ""short"", which has H at position 2.

   If incorrect, we can try others.

   But we have a good chance.

   Alternatively, we might be missing something: in guess 1, we had S present but not at position 4. In our structure, S is at 1 and not at 4, good. And R is at 4, not at 1, good.

   Now, for position 2, we need a letter. So ""short"" seems a valid choice.

   Final decision: guess ""short"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""raise""): R and S are in the secret word, but not in position 1 and 4 respectively. A, I, and E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""storm""): S, O, and R are in their correct positions (1, 3, 4). T is present but not in position 2. M is absent.

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: S _ O R _  
   - Position 1: ✓ S  
   - Position 3: ✓ O  
   - Position 4: ✓ R  
   - Position 2: Must be an unknown letter (not A, I, E, M, T).  
   - Position 5: Must be T (since T is present and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).  

2. **Known absent letters**: A, E, I, M.  
3. **Possible words**: With S _ O R T, the only valid English words are ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"", or ""skort"" (depending on letter 2: H, N, P, or K).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Guess ""short"" to verify if H is the missing letter. It matches all feedback constraints and covers a common possibility.  
- If incorrect, future guesses can narrow down other letters (N, P, K) for position 2.  

<guess>short</guess>",short,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: raise**
- R: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)
- A: `x` (not in secret word)
- I: `x` (not in secret word)
- S: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)
- E: `x` (not in secret word)

**Guess 2: storm**
- S: `✓` (correct position!)
- T: `-` (in the word, wrong position)
- O: `✓` (correct position!)
- R: `✓` (correct position!)
- M: `x` (not in secret word)

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. **Letters in secret word:**
   - S, O, R are confirmed (from ✓ in guess 2).
   - T is confirmed (from `-` in guess 2).
   - R was also in guess 1 but wrong position, which is consistent since now R is at position 4 and it's correct.
   - We also know from guess 1 that R and S are in the word but at the time were in wrong positions, which aligns with the second guess showing R and S in correct positions.

2. **Correct positions (from guess 2):**
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 2: ? (T is in the word but not at position 2)
   - Position 3: O (✓)
   - Position 4: R (✓)
   - Position 5: ? (M is not in the word, so position 5 is open)

3. **Additional facts:**
   - T is in the word but not at position 2 (since in ""storm"" it's at position 2 and marked `-`).
   - A, I, E, M are not in the word (from `x` marks).
   - From guess 1, S is not at position 4 (which we now know is correct because in guess 2, S is at position 1 and ✓, and position 4 is R).

4. **Structure of secret word:**
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be T since T is in the word but not here)
   - Position 3: O
   - Position 4: R
   - Position 5: ? (unknown)

   We know T is in the word, but not at position 2. So where can T be? It must be at one of the unknown positions, but positions 1,3,4 are fixed. The only unknown positions are 2 and 5, and position 2 is already ruled out for T. Therefore, T must be at position 5? Wait, not necessarily because we have only two unknown positions: 2 and 5. Position 2 we know isn't T (from feedback on ""storm""). But T could be at position 5, or could it be elsewhere? Positions 1,3,4 are S,O,R respectively and fixed. T is not at position 2, so the only other possibility is position 5.

   However, we must remember that words may have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates, and T is a new letter. Also, from feedback, T is in the word and only position 5 is available besides 2. So T must be at position 5? But wait, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in this case, since we know T is present and not at position 2, and positions 1,3,4 are occupied by S,O,R. So if T is at position 5, that would work. But what if the word has T in an earlier position that we thought was fixed? But no, positions 1,3,4 are fixed and already known letters: S,O,R respectively. So T cannot be at position 1,3,4 because those are already S,O,R. And it's not at position 2. Therefore, T must be at position 5.

   So we can deduce that position 5 must be T? Wait, let me confirm:

   Secret word positions:
   1: S
   2: some letter (not T)
   3: O
   4: R
   5: must be T? Because T is in the word and can only go there.

   However, we must be cautious. But logically, there's no other position for T. Therefore, we can conclude that position 5 is T.

   So now the secret word is: S _ O R T

   With the blank at position 2.

5. **Position 2:**
   - We need to find a letter for position 2.
   - It cannot be any of the absent letters: A, I, E, M (from previous feedback).
   - Also, from guess 1: the word cannot have A, I, E. And in guess 2, M is absent. So absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   What other letters are possible? And we must form a valid English word of the form S_ORT.

   Common 5-letter words that match S_ORT: ? Let me think.

   - Short? But we know that ""short"" has H. And the feedback from previous guesses? We don't have feedback about H yet. But let us remember if H is excluded? From previous guesses, we have no information about H. Also, in guess 1, we had no H, and guess 2 was ""storm"" which has no H.

   - Possibilities: short, snort, sport, etc.

   But we have constraints: the secret word must contain the letters we've deduced: S, O, R, T and one more letter at position 2.

   Also, we must avoid the absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   Now, let's consider:

   - ""short"": S H O R T. H is a possible letter.
   - ""snort"": S N O R T. N is possible.
   - ""sport"": S P O R T. P is possible.
   - ""fort"" is 4 letters. ""sort"" is 4 letters.

   So candidates: short, snort, sport.

   How can we confirm?

   We have one more piece of information: from guess 1, the word had S and R, but in wrong positions. In ""short"": R is at position 4. In guess 1, we had R at position 1 and it was marked `-` (wrong position). But in the secret word ""short"", position 1 is S, not R, so that's consistent because R is at 4. Similarly for S: in guess 1, S was at position 4 and marked `-`, meaning it's not at 4. In ""short"", S is at position 1, so that's different and correct.

   Similarly for other words.

   But to decide which word to pick, we need to use the feedback to our advantage. We have only one unknown letter.

   Alternatively, we might guess one of these words to finish.

   But note, we have 6 total guesses, so we can try one.

   However, we want to be efficient.

   Let me see if we can utilize more information.

   In particular, from guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` meaning it is not at 1, which we already used. Similarly, the S at position 4 was marked `-` meaning not at 4. Now in our deduced form, S is at 1 and R is at 4, consistent.

   But is there any constraint from other letters? In guess 1, we had A,I,E absent, but not H, N, P, etc.

   So we have three candidates: short, snort, sport.

   To guess correctly, we could pick one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   But note: we haven't tested H, N, P.

   Also, from guess 2, we tested T and got `-` at position 2, but now we have T at position 5? Wait, we deduced that position 5 must be T. Then why in guess 2, T was at position 2 and marked `-`? Because in the secret word, T is at position 5, so indeed position 2 is wrong.

   So our deduction is correct: secret word is S, ?, O, R, T.

   Now, which letter for position 2?

   Without more information, we must guess among the possibilities.

   But we can make a guess that uses one of these letters to cover it.

   Similarly, ""snort"" has N, ""sport"" has P.

   Since we don't know, and we want to solve, we can guess ""short"".

   But wait, we have three possibilities. What if we guess ""sort"" but that's 4 letters? No, it must be 5 letters.

   How about guessing ""scout""? But that has U and we don't have U? Also, our deduced word must have O at position 3 and R at position 4. ""scout"" is S C O U T, so positions: S, C, O, U, T. But if the secret word were ""scout"", we would have position 3: O (correct because we got ✓ for O in ""storm""), but position 4 would be U, not R. But we know position 4 is R (✓ from ""storm""), so that doesn't match. Therefore, ""scout"" cannot be because position 4 must be R.

   Similarly, any word must have S at 1, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

   So the only freedom is position 2.

   We need to guess the letter at position 2, which is one of H, P, N? Or others?

   Other possibilities: ""sport"" (P), ""short"" (H), ""snort"" (N), ""start"" but A is absent? ""start"" has T at the end and S at start? But ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T -> but A is absent? We know A is not in the word, so invalid. ""sturt"" is not a word. ""skort"" is a word? Meaning: skort (a skirt with shorts) -> S,K,O,R,T. K is a possibility. So K is also untested.

   We also have ""skort"". And ""spurt"" but then position 3 is U? And must be O? So ""spurt"" is S,P,U,R,T -> position 3 is U, but we must have O at position 3? Therefore, only words that have O at position 3 and R at position 4 and T at position 5.

   Therefore, more precisely, S?ORT.

   Words: short (H), sport (P), snort (N), skort (K), and perhaps more? 

   Also, ""sword"" but that's 5 letters? S W O R D -> ends with D, not T. No match: must end with T.

   Possible words: short, snort, sport, skort.

   So letters for position 2: H, N, P, K.

   Now, we have not tested H, N, P, K.

   How to decide? We can choose a word that uses one of these and see.

   Given we are on the third guess, we might as well guess one.

   I'll choose ""short"" because it's very common.

   Therefore, next guess: ""short""

   But let me explain: from the deduction, we have the word as S?ORT with ? being a letter that is not A, I, E, M. Additionally, from the feedback, we know T must be at position 5 because it has to be somewhere and only that position is available.

   Now, for position 2, we need a letter. So ""short"" seems a valid choice.

   Final decision: guess ""short"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""raise""): R and S are in the secret word, but not in position 1 and 4 respectively. A, I, and E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""storm""): S, O, and R are in their correct positions (1, 3, 4). T is present but not in position 2. M is absent.

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: S _ O R _  
   - Position 1: ✓ S  
   - Position 3: ✓ O  
   - Position 4: ✓ R  
   - Position 2: Must be an unknown letter (not A, I, E, M, T).  
   - Position 5: Must be T (since T is present and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).  

2. **Known absent letters**: A, E, I, M.  
3. **Possible words**: With S _ O R T, the only valid English words are ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"", or ""skort"" (depending on letter 2: H, N, P, or K).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Guess ""short"" to verify if H is the missing letter. It matches all feedback constraints and covers a common possibility.

The goal is to maximize information gain. We want to guess a word that includes common letters and has as many distinct letters as possible to cover a broad set.

Common English vowels and consonants: vowels are A, E, I, O, U; common consonants include R, S, T, N, etc.

A popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRATE"" because it contains the common letters C, R, A, T, E. However, let me consider another word with distinct letters and common letters.

Another candidate might be ""ROAST"" but it has two 'S's? No, it's R,O,A,S,T -> all distinct.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a common starter.

But note: we are allowed 6 tries and at the first guess we haven't received any feedback.

I recall that ""RAISE"" is a good starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives a good coverage.

Another candidate is ""SOARE"" (which is a bird, valid in some dictionaries) but might be less common.

Let me check: for maximum coverage, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

The most frequent letters in 5-letter English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

We can choose a word that includes as many of these as possible.

Possible choices: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"" (if valid, but it might not be common).

RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. These are all very common.

So, I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But wait, is ""RAISE"" a valid five-letter word? Yes.

So, let me output accordingly.For the first guess, I selected a word that maximizes information gain by including common letters and distinct letters to cover a broad range. Common letters like vowels (A, E, I) and consonants (R, S) appear frequently in 5-letter words. ""RAISE"" uses five distinct letters, all common in English, which helps test multiple positions at once and increases the chances of receiving useful feedback.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- I: (x) meaning I is not in the secret word.
- S: (-) meaning S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and S, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". In ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, and S cannot be at position 4.
- The letters A, I, and E are absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and S (each at least once, but we don't know about duplicates yet).
- Does not include A, I, E.

We also know the word is 5 letters.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain A, I, E (since they are absent).
- Includes R and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (because in ""raise"", R was at position 1 and S at position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, so they must be in other positions).
- Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R and S are in the word, we should try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be at position 1, it can be at 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, S cannot be at position 4, so it can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, for now, we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

We also need to avoid A, I, E.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also have vowels: O and U (and sometimes Y) are still possible.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let me think of words that have R and S, and avoid A, I, E.

For example, words like: ""roast"", but ""roast"" has A and we know A is absent. So not allowed.

Another: ""rusts"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are present. Also, we want to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information? Actually, we can use duplicates to test, but it might be less informative.

But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once. Similarly for R.

However, to keep it simple, let's try a word with R and S and without A, I, E.

Possible words: 
- ""story"" -> S at position 1, T, O, R, Y. But in our feedback, S was at position 4 and was wrong, but now we put S at position 1. That's allowed because we don't know if position 1 is correct for S. Similarly, R was at position 1 in the first guess and now we put it at position 4. But note: we know R is in the word but not at position 1, so position 4 might be possible.

But ""story"" has O and Y, which we haven't tested.

Another word: ""crown"" but no S and we need to include S? We must include R and S? Actually, we don't have to, but it's beneficial because we know they are in the word. By including them, we can get their positions.

We know R and S are present, so we should use them to find their correct positions.

So, let's try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (not A, I, E) to test.

Possible words: 
- ""syrup"" -> S at 1, Y, R, U, P. But U is a vowel. This is acceptable.
- ""pours"" -> P, O, U, R, S. S is at position 5, which is different from position 4 (which was wrong in the first guess). And R is at position 4, which is not position 1.

But we have to avoid A, I, E. ""pours"" doesn't have them.

Another: ""torus"" -> T, O, R, U, S. S at position 5.

But let me check if these are valid words.

We can also consider: ""storm"" -> S, T, O, R, M. This has S at 1 and R at 4. We know from first guess that R cannot be at 1 and S cannot be at 4. In ""storm"", S is at 1 (which we don't know about) and R is at 4 (which we don't know about). So this is a good candidate.

Also, ""storm"" uses O and T and M, which are common.

Another candidate: ""scorn"" -> S, C, O, R, N. Similarly, S at 1, R at 4.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting S at position 1. That's fine because we are testing a new position.

Similarly, R was at position 1 and now we put it at position 4.

We can also consider words where R and S are in other positions.

For example, put R at position 2 and S at position 3? Like ""crisp"" but C, R, I, S, P -> but I is absent, so we cannot use I.

Avoid I.

So, ""crops"" -> C, R, O, P, S. S at position 5. This is also good.

But ""crops"" has S at 5, which is different from 4.

We can also try ""dross"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present. It might be less informative.

So, to maximize new letters, we should avoid duplicates in our guess.

Therefore, I think ""storm"" is a good choice: it has S, T, O, R, M. All distinct and common letters.

Similarly, ""proud"" but no S? We need S.

Another: ""short"" -> S, H, O, R, T. S at 1, R at 4. Same as ""storm"".

But ""short"" has H and T, which are also common.

But ""storm"" has M, which is less common? But still acceptable.

We can also consider ""snort"" -> S, N, O, R, T.

But let me choose one.

I think ""storm"" is a valid and common word.

So, I'll go with ""storm"".

But wait: we are going to test S at position 1 and R at position 4. Also, we test T, O, M.

If we get feedback, we can know about these positions.

Alternatively, we could put R in a different position. For example, we know R is not at position 1, but we haven't tested position 2,3,5. Similarly for S: not at 4, but we haven't tested 1,2,3,5.

In ""storm"", we test S at 1 and R at 4.

But we also test O at 3 and M at 5.

Another idea: we could test R at position 2 and S at position 1? For example, ""shrug"" -> S, H, R, U, G. But then we don't test many vowels? But we know E and I are absent, so U and O are the remaining vowels.

But ""shrug"" is a valid word.

However, I think ""storm"" is fine.

Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Common letters left: O, T, N, L, etc.

Another word: ""store"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

""store"" has E, which is absent. So invalid.

""story"" -> S, T, O, R, Y. Y is at the end. This is also good.

But Y is less common? But it's acceptable.

I think ""storm"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: ""storm""

But note: we must ensure that the word does not have A, I, E. ""storm"" has S, T, O, R, M. No A, I, E. Good.

Also, R is at position 4 (which was position 4 in the first guess was S, but now R is at 4). We don't know if position 4 is correct for R.

Similarly, S is at position 1.

We are testing new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""storm"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- A, I, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- Include R and S (since they are in the word), but avoid placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.
- Exclude A, I, and E.
- Test new common letters (like T, O, M) to gather more information.
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.

The word ""storm"" fits these criteria:
- S is at position 1 (a new position, not 4).
- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 1).
- It includes new letters T, O, and M, which are common and untested.
- It avoids A, I, and E.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of R and S while testing three additional letters.

<guess>storm</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: raise**
- R: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)
- A: `x` (not in secret word)
- I: `x` (not in secret word)
- S: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)
- E: `x` (not in secret word)

**Guess 2: storm**
- S: `✓` (correct position!)
- T: `-` (in the word, wrong position)
- O: `✓` (correct position!)
- R: `✓` (correct position!)
- M: `x` (not in secret word)

Now, let's summarize what we know:

1. **Letters in secret word:**
   - S, O, R are confirmed (from ✓ in guess 2).
   - T is confirmed (from `-` in guess 2).
   - R was also in guess 1 but wrong position, which is consistent since now R is at position 4 and it's correct.
   - We also know from guess 1 that R and S are in the word but at the time were in wrong positions, which aligns with the second guess showing R and S in correct positions.

2. **Correct positions (from guess 2):**
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 2: ? (T is in the word but not at position 2)
   - Position 3: O (✓)
   - Position 4: R (✓)
   - Position 5: ? (M is not in the word, so position 5 is open)

3. **Additional facts:**
   - T is in the word but not at position 2 (since in ""storm"" it's at position 2 and marked `-`).
   - A, I, E, M are not in the word (from `x` marks).
   - From guess 1, S is not at position 4 (which we now know is correct because in guess 2, S is at position 1 and ✓, and position 4 is R).

4. **Structure of secret word:**
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be T since T is in the word but not here)
   - Position 3: O
   - Position 4: R
   - Position 5: ? (unknown)

   We know T is in the word, but not at position 2. So where can T be? It must be at one of the unknown positions, but positions 1,3,4 are fixed. The only unknown positions are 2 and 5, and position 2 is already ruled out for T. Therefore, T must be at position 5? Wait, not necessarily because we have only two unknown positions: 2 and 5. Position 2 we know isn't T (from feedback on ""storm""). But T could be at position 5, or could it be elsewhere? Positions 1,3,4 are S,O,R respectively and fixed. T is not at position 2, so the only other possibility is position 5.

   However, we must remember that words may have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen evidence of duplicates, and T is a new letter. Also, from feedback, T is in the word and only position 5 is available besides 2. So T must be at position 5? But wait, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in this case, since we know T is present and not at position 2, and positions 1,3,4 are occupied by S,O,R. So if T is at position 5, that would work. But what if the word has T in an earlier position that we thought was fixed? But no, positions 1,3,4 are fixed and already known letters: S,O,R respectively. So T cannot be at position 1,3,4 because those are already S,O,R. And it's not at position 2. Therefore, T must be at position 5.

   So we can deduce that position 5 must be T? Wait, let me confirm:

   Secret word positions:
   1: S
   2: some letter (not T)
   3: O
   4: R
   5: must be T? Because T is in the word and can only go there.

   However, we must be cautious. But logically, there's no other position for T. Therefore, we can conclude that position 5 is T.

   So now the secret word is: S _ O R T

   With the blank at position 2.

5. **Position 2:**
   - We need to find a letter for position 2.
   - It cannot be any of the absent letters: A, I, E, M (from previous feedback).
   - Also, from guess 1: the word cannot have A, I, E. And in guess 2, M is absent. So absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   What other letters are possible? And we must form a valid English word of the form S_ORT.

   Common 5-letter words that match S_ORT: ? Let me think.

   - Short? But we know that ""short"" has H. And the feedback from previous guesses? We don't have feedback about H yet. But let us remember if H is excluded? From previous guesses, we have no information about H. Also, in guess 1, we had no H, and guess 2 was ""storm"" which has no H.

   - Possibilities: short, snort, sport, etc.

   But we have constraints: the secret word must contain the letters we've deduced: S, O, R, T and one more letter at position 2.

   Also, we must avoid the absent letters: A, I, E, M.

   Now, let's consider:

   - ""short"": S H O R T. H is a possible letter.
   - ""snort"": S N O R T. N is possible.
   - ""sport"": S P O R T. P is possible.
   - ""fort"" is 4 letters. ""sort"" is 4 letters.

   So candidates: short, snort, sport.

   How can we confirm?

   We have one more piece of information: from guess 1, the word had S and R, but in wrong positions. In ""short"": R is at position 4. In guess 1, we had R at position 1 and it was marked `-` (wrong position). But in the secret word ""short"", position 1 is S, not R, so that's consistent because R is at 4. Similarly for S: in guess 1, S was at position 4 and marked `-`, meaning it's not at 4. In ""short"", S is at position 1, so that's different and correct.

   Similarly for other words.

   But to decide which word to pick, we need to use the feedback to our advantage. We have only one unknown letter.

   Alternatively, we might guess one of these words to finish.

   But note, we have 6 total guesses, so we can try one.

   However, we want to be efficient.

   Let me see if we can utilize more information.

   In particular, from guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` meaning it is not at 1, which we already used. Similarly, the S at position 4 was marked `-` meaning not at 4. Now in our deduced form, S is at 1 and R is at 4, consistent.

   But is there any constraint from other letters? In guess 1, we had A,I,E absent, but not H, N, P, etc.

   So we have three candidates: short, snort, sport.

   To guess correctly, we could pick one that tests a letter we haven't tried.

   But note: we haven't tested H, N, P.

   Also, from guess 2, we tested T and got `-` at position 2, but now we have T at position 5? Wait, we deduced that position 5 must be T. Then why in guess 2, T was at position 2 and marked `-`? Because in the secret word, T is at position 5, so indeed position 2 is wrong.

   So our deduction is correct: secret word is S, ?, O, R, T.

   Now, which letter for position 2?

   Without more information, we must guess among the possibilities.

   But we can make a guess that uses one of these letters to cover it.

   Alternatively, we could make a new guess that includes more untested letters? But we know four letters: S,O,R,T, so we are missing only one letter.

   Since we have only one unknown letter, it's better to guess one of the words to solve.

   Let me see: ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"" are all valid words.

   We have had no feedback about H, N, or P.

   Since we know the word ends with T (position 5), and pattern S_ORT.

   But we can try to think if there are other possibilities. For example, is there a word ""stort""? No, not English. Or ""scort""? Scort is not a word. We have common words: short, snort, sport.

   Another one: ""swort"" is not valid.

   So the possibilities are limited.

   Given we have guesses left, we can pick one.

   But note: in guess 1, we had R and S in wrong positions. But in these words, R is always at position 4 (fixed by second guess) and S at position 1, so no issue.

   How about the fact that in guess 2, we tested T at position 2 and got `-`, which is consistent with our deduction because T is at position 5.

   Now, to choose, we can think about frequency or make a strategic guess.

   Alternatively, we might use a word to test multiple options? But since we have only one unknown, we can guess any of them.

   I propose guessing ""short"" because it includes H, which is a common letter we haven't tested.

   Similarly, ""snort"" has N, ""sport"" has P.

   Since we don't know, and we want to solve, we can guess ""short"".

   But wait, we have three possibilities. What if we guess ""sort"" but that's 4 letters? No, it must be 5 letters.

   How about guessing ""scout""? But that has U and we don't have U? Also, our deduced word must have O at position 3 and R at position 4. ""scout"" is S C O U T, so positions: S, C, O, U, T. But if the secret word were ""scout"", we would have position 3: O (correct because we got ✓ for O in ""storm""), but position 4 would be U, not R. But we know position 4 is R (✓ from ""storm""), so that doesn't match. Therefore, ""scout"" cannot be because position 4 must be R.

   Similarly, any word must have S at 1, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.

   So the only freedom is position 2.

   We need to guess the letter at position 2, which is one of H, P, N? Or others?

   Other possibilities: ""sport"" (P), ""short"" (H), ""snort"" (N), ""start"" but A is absent? ""start"" has T at the end and S at start? But ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T -> but A is absent? We know A is not in the word, so invalid. ""sturt"" is not a word. ""skort"" is a word? Meaning: skort (a skirt with shorts) -> S,K,O,R,T. K is a possibility. So K is also untested.

   We also have ""skort"". And ""spurt"" but then position 3 is U? And must be O? So ""spurt"" is S,P,U,R,T -> position 3 is U, but we must have O at position 3? Therefore, only words that have O at position 3 and R at position 4 and T at position 5.

   Therefore, more precisely, S?ORT.

   Words: short (H), sport (P), snort (N), skort (K), and perhaps more? 

   Also, ""sword"" but that's 5 letters? S W O R D -> ends with D, not T. No match: must end with T.

   Possible words: short, snort, sport, skort.

   So letters for position 2: H, N, P, K.

   Now, we have not tested H, N, P, K.

   How to decide? We can choose a word that uses one of these and see.

   Given we are on the third guess, we might as well guess one.

   I'll choose ""short"" because it's very common.

   Alternatively, we could use a guess to narrow down by choosing a word that tests multiple letters? But we only have one blank to fill. 

   Since we have to fill position 2, we cannot avoid testing only one letter per guess.

   So I'll guess ""short"".

   Therefore, next guess: ""short""

   But let me explain: from the deduction, we have the word as S?ORT with ? being a letter that is not A, I, E, M. Additionally, from the feedback, we know T must be at position 5 because it has to be somewhere and only that position is available. Thus, I am confirming by guessing ""short"", which has H at position 2.

   If incorrect, we can try others.

   But we have a good chance.

   Alternatively, we might be missing something: in guess 1, we had S present but not at position 4. In our structure, S is at 1 and not at 4, good. And R is at 4, not at 1, good.

   Now, for position 2, we need a letter. So ""short"" seems a valid choice.

   Final decision: guess ""short"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From Guess 1 (""raise""): R and S are in the secret word, but not in position 1 and 4 respectively. A, I, and E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""storm""): S, O, and R are in their correct positions (1, 3, 4). T is present but not in position 2. M is absent.

### Deductions:
1. **Secret word structure**: S _ O R _  
   - Position 1: ✓ S  
   - Position 3: ✓ O  
   - Position 4: ✓ R  
   - Position 2: Must be an unknown letter (not A, I, E, M, T).  
   - Position 5: Must be T (since T is present and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).  

2. **Known absent letters**: A, E, I, M.  
3. **Possible words**: With S _ O R T, the only valid English words are ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"", or ""skort"" (depending on letter 2: H, N, P, or K).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Guess ""short"" to verify if H is the missing letter. It matches all feedback constraints and covers a common possibility.  
- If incorrect, future guesses can narrow down other letters (N, P, K) for position 2.

Actually, we can use duplicates to test, but it might be less informative.\n\nBut note: we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears more than once. Similarly for R.\n\nHowever, to keep it simple, let\'s try a word with R and S and without A, I, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""story"" -> S at position 1, T, O, R, Y. But in our feedback, S was at position 4 and was wrong, but now we put S at position 1. That\'s allowed because we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for S. Similarly, R was at position 1 in the first guess and now we put it at position 4. But note: we know R is in the word but not at position 1, so position 4 might be possible.\n\nBut ""story"" has O and Y, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nAnother word: ""crown"" but no S and we need to include S? We must include R and S? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it\'s beneficial because we know they are in the word. By including them, we can get their positions.\n\nWe know R and S are present, so we should use them to find their correct positions.\n\nSo, let\'s try to form a word that has R and S, and three new letters (not A, I, E) to test.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""syrup"" -> S at 1, Y, R, U, P. But U is a vowel. This is acceptable.\n- ""pours"" -> P, O, U, R, S. S is at position 5, which is different from position 4 (which was wrong in the first guess). And R is at position 4, which is not position 1.\n\nBut we have to avoid A, I, E. ""pours"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nAnother: ""torus"" -> T, O, R, U, S. S at position 5.\n\nBut let me check if these are valid words.\n\nWe can also consider: ""storm"" -> S, T, O, R, M. This has S at 1 and R at 4. We know from first guess that R cannot be at 1 and S cannot be at 4. In ""storm"", S is at 1 (which we don\'t know about) and R is at 4 (which we don\'t know about). So this is a good candidate.\n\nAlso, ""storm"" uses O and T and M, which are common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""scorn"" -> S, C, O, R, N. Similarly, S at 1, R at 4.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting S at position 1. That\'s fine because we are testing a new position.\n\nSimilarly, R was at position 1 and now we put it at position 4.\n\nWe can also consider words where R and S are in other positions.\n\nFor example, put R at position 2 and S at position 3? Like ""crisp"" but C, R, I, S, P -> but I is absent, so we cannot use I.\n\nAvoid I.\n\nSo, ""crops"" -> C, R, O, P, S. S at position 5. This is also good.\n\nBut ""crops"" has S at 5, which is different from 4.\n\nWe can also try ""dross"" but that has duplicate S? And we don\'t know if duplicate S is present. It might be less informative.\n\nSo, to maximize new letters, we should avoid duplicates in our guess.\n\nTherefore, I think ""storm"" is a good choice: it has S, T, O, R, M. All distinct and common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""proud"" but no S? We need S.\n\nAnother: ""short"" -> S, H, O, R, T. S at 1, R at 4. Same as ""storm"".\n\nBut ""short"" has H and T, which are also common.\n\nBut ""storm"" has M, which is less common? But still acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""snort"" -> S, N, O, R, T.\n\nBut let me choose one.\n\nI think ""storm"" is a valid and common word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""storm"".\n\nBut wait: we are going to test S at position 1 and R at position 4. Also, we test T, O, M.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can know about these positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could put R in a different position. For example, we know R is not at position 1, but we haven\'t tested position 2,3,5. Similarly for S: not at 4, but we haven\'t tested 1,2,3,5.\n\nIn ""storm"", we test S at 1 and R at 4.\n\nBut we also test O at 3 and M at 5.\n\nAnother idea: we could test R at position 2 and S at position 1? For example, ""shrug"" -> S, H, R, U, G. But then we don\'t test many vowels? But we know E and I are absent, so U and O are the remaining vowels.\n\nBut ""shrug"" is a valid word.\n\nHowever, I think ""storm"" is fine.\n\nLet me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: O, T, N, L, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""store"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.\n\n""store"" has E, which is absent. So invalid.\n\n""story"" -> S, T, O, R, Y. Y is at the end. This is also good.\n\nBut Y is less common? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nI think ""storm"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, second guess: ""storm""\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word does not have A, I, E. ""storm"" has S, T, O, R, M. No A, I, E. Good.\n\nAlso, R is at position 4 (which was position 4 in the first guess was S, but now R is at 4). We don\'t know if position 4 is correct for R.\n\nSimilarly, S is at position 1.\n\nWe are testing new positions.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""storm"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- S is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- A, I, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n- Include R and S (since they are in the word), but avoid placing R at position 1 or S at position 4.\n- Exclude A, I, and E.\n- Test new common letters (like T, O, M) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize coverage.\n\nThe word ""storm"" fits these criteria:\n- S is at position 1 (a new position, not 4).\n- R is at position 4 (a new position, not 1).\n- It includes new letters T, O, and M, which are common and untested.\n- It avoids A, I, and E.\n\nThis guess will help identify the correct positions of R and S while testing three additional letters.\n\n<guess>storm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: raise**\n- R: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)\n- A: `x` (not in secret word)\n- I: `x` (not in secret word)\n- S: `-` (in the secret word, wrong position)\n- E: `x` (not in secret word)\n\n**Guess 2: storm**\n- S: `✓` (correct position!)\n- T: `-` (in the word, wrong position)\n- O: `✓` (correct position!)\n- R: `✓` (correct position!)\n- M: `x` (not in secret word)\n\nNow, let\'s summarize what we know:\n\n1. **Letters in secret word:**\n   - S, O, R are confirmed (from ✓ in guess 2).\n   - T is confirmed (from `-` in guess 2).\n   - R was also in guess 1 but wrong position, which is consistent since now R is at position 4 and it\'s correct.\n   - We also know from guess 1 that R and S are in the word but at the time were in wrong positions, which aligns with the second guess showing R and S in correct positions.\n\n2. **Correct positions (from guess 2):**\n   - Position 1: S (✓)\n   - Position 2: ? (T is in the word but not at position 2)\n   - Position 3: O (✓)\n   - Position 4: R (✓)\n   - Position 5: ? (M is not in the word, so position 5 is open)\n\n3. **Additional facts:**\n   - T is in the word but not at position 2 (since in ""storm"" it\'s at position 2 and marked `-`).\n   - A, I, E, M are not in the word (from `x` marks).\n   - From guess 1, S is not at position 4 (which we now know is correct because in guess 2, S is at position 1 and ✓, and position 4 is R).\n\n4. **Structure of secret word:**\n   - Position 1: S\n   - Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be T since T is in the word but not here)\n   - Position 3: O\n   - Position 4: R\n   - Position 5: ? (unknown)\n\n   We know T is in the word, but not at position 2. So where can T be? It must be at one of the unknown positions, but positions 1,3,4 are fixed. The only unknown positions are 2 and 5, and position 2 is already ruled out for T. Therefore, T must be at position 5? Wait, not necessarily because we have only two unknown positions: 2 and 5. Position 2 we know isn\'t T (from feedback on ""storm""). But T could be at position 5, or could it be elsewhere? Positions 1,3,4 are S,O,R respectively and fixed. T is not at position 2, so the only other possibility is position 5.\n\n   However, we must remember that words may have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen evidence of duplicates, and T is a new letter. Also, from feedback, T is in the word and only position 5 is available besides 2. So T must be at position 5? But wait, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, in this case, since we know T is present and not at position 2, and positions 1,3,4 are occupied by S,O,R. So if T is at position 5, that would work. But what if the word has T in an earlier position that we thought was fixed? But no, positions 1,3,4 are fixed and already known letters: S,O,R respectively. So T cannot be at position 1,3,4 because those are already S,O,R. And it\'s not at position 2. Therefore, T must be at position 5.\n\n   So we can deduce that position 5 must be T? Wait, let me confirm:\n\n   Secret word positions:\n   1: S\n   2: some letter (not T)\n   3: O\n   4: R\n   5: must be T? Because T is in the word and can only go there.\n\n   However, we must be cautious. But logically, there\'s no other position for T. Therefore, we can conclude that position 5 is T.\n\n   So now the secret word is: S _ O R T\n\n   With the blank at position 2.\n\n5. **Position 2:**\n   - We need to find a letter for position 2.\n   - It cannot be any of the absent letters: A, I, E, M (from previous feedback).\n   - Also, from guess 1: the word cannot have A, I, E. And in guess 2, M is absent. So absent letters: A, I, E, M.\n\n   What other letters are possible? And we must form a valid English word of the form S_ORT.\n\n   Common 5-letter words that match S_ORT: ? Let me think.\n\n   - Short? But we know that ""short"" has H. And the feedback from previous guesses? We don\'t have feedback about H yet. But let us remember if H is excluded? From previous guesses, we have no information about H. Also, in guess 1, we had no H, and guess 2 was ""storm"" which has no H.\n\n   - Possibilities: short, snort, sport, etc.\n\n   But we have constraints: the secret word must contain the letters we\'ve deduced: S, O, R, T and one more letter at position 2.\n\n   Also, we must avoid the absent letters: A, I, E, M.\n\n   Now, let\'s consider:\n\n   - ""short"": S H O R T. H is a possible letter.\n   - ""snort"": S N O R T. N is possible.\n   - ""sport"": S P O R T. P is possible.\n   - ""fort"" is 4 letters. ""sort"" is 4 letters.\n\n   So candidates: short, snort, sport.\n\n   How can we confirm?\n\n   We have one more piece of information: from guess 1, the word had S and R, but in wrong positions. In ""short"": R is at position 4. In guess 1, we had R at position 1 and it was marked `-` (wrong position). But in the secret word ""short"", position 1 is S, not R, so that\'s consistent because R is at 4. Similarly for S: in guess 1, S was at position 4 and marked `-`, meaning it\'s not at 4. In ""short"", S is at position 1, so that\'s different and correct.\n\n   Similarly for other words.\n\n   But to decide which word to pick, we need to use the feedback to our advantage. We have only one unknown letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we might guess one of these words to finish.\n\n   But note, we have 6 total guesses, so we can try one.\n\n   However, we want to be efficient.\n\n   Let me see if we can utilize more information.\n\n   In particular, from guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` meaning it is not at 1, which we already used. Similarly, the S at position 4 was marked `-` meaning not at 4. Now in our deduced form, S is at 1 and R is at 4, consistent.\n\n   But is there any constraint from other letters? In guess 1, we had A,I,E absent, but not H, N, P, etc.\n\n   So we have three candidates: short, snort, sport.\n\n   To guess correctly, we could pick one that tests a letter we haven\'t tried.\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tested H, N, P.\n\n   Also, from guess 2, we tested T and got `-` at position 2, but now we have T at position 5? Wait, we deduced that position 5 must be T. Then why in guess 2, T was at position 2 and marked `-`? Because in the secret word, T is at position 5, so indeed position 2 is wrong.\n\n   So our deduction is correct: secret word is S, ?, O, R, T.\n\n   Now, which letter for position 2?\n\n   Without more information, we must guess among the possibilities.\n\n   But we can make a guess that uses one of these letters to cover it.\n\n   Alternatively, we could make a new guess that includes more untested letters? But we know four letters: S,O,R,T, so we are missing only one letter.\n\n   Since we have only one unknown letter, it\'s better to guess one of the words to solve.\n\n   Let me see: ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"" are all valid words.\n\n   We have had no feedback about H, N, or P.\n\n   Since we know the word ends with T (position 5), and pattern S_ORT.\n\n   But we can try to think if there are other possibilities. For example, is there a word ""stort""? No, not English. Or ""scort""? Scort is not a word. We have common words: short, snort, sport.\n\n   Another one: ""swort"" is not valid.\n\n   So the possibilities are limited.\n\n   Given we have guesses left, we can pick one.\n\n   But note: in guess 1, we had R and S in wrong positions. But in these words, R is always at position 4 (fixed by second guess) and S at position 1, so no issue.\n\n   How about the fact that in guess 2, we tested T at position 2 and got `-`, which is consistent with our deduction because T is at position 5.\n\n   Now, to choose, we can think about frequency or make a strategic guess.\n\n   Alternatively, we might use a word to test multiple options? But since we have only one unknown, we can guess any of them.\n\n   I propose guessing ""short"" because it includes H, which is a common letter we haven\'t tested.\n\n   Similarly, ""snort"" has N, ""sport"" has P.\n\n   Since we don\'t know, and we want to solve, we can guess ""short"".\n\n   But wait, we have three possibilities. What if we guess ""sort"" but that\'s 4 letters? No, it must be 5 letters.\n\n   How about guessing ""scout""? But that has U and we don\'t have U? Also, our deduced word must have O at position 3 and R at position 4. ""scout"" is S C O U T, so positions: S, C, O, U, T. But if the secret word were ""scout"", we would have position 3: O (correct because we got ✓ for O in ""storm""), but position 4 would be U, not R. But we know position 4 is R (✓ from ""storm""), so that doesn\'t match. Therefore, ""scout"" cannot be because position 4 must be R.\n\n   Similarly, any word must have S at 1, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n\n   So the only freedom is position 2.\n\n   We need to guess the letter at position 2, which is one of H, P, N? Or others?\n\n   Other possibilities: ""sport"" (P), ""short"" (H), ""snort"" (N), ""start"" but A is absent? ""start"" has T at the end and S at start? But ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T -> but A is absent? We know A is not in the word, so invalid. ""sturt"" is not a word. ""skort"" is a word? Meaning: skort (a skirt with shorts) -> S,K,O,R,T. K is a possibility. So K is also untested.\n\n   We also have ""skort"". And ""spurt"" but then position 3 is U? And must be O? So ""spurt"" is S,P,U,R,T -> position 3 is U, but we must have O at position 3? Therefore, only words that have O at position 3 and R at position 4 and T at position 5.\n\n   Therefore, more precisely, S?ORT.\n\n   Words: short (H), sport (P), snort (N), skort (K), and perhaps more? \n\n   Also, ""sword"" but that\'s 5 letters? S W O R D -> ends with D, not T. No match: must end with T.\n\n   Possible words: short, snort, sport, skort.\n\n   So letters for position 2: H, N, P, K.\n\n   Now, we have not tested H, N, P, K.\n\n   How to decide? We can choose a word that uses one of these and see.\n\n   Given we are on the third guess, we might as well guess one.\n\n   I\'ll choose ""short"" because it\'s very common.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a guess to narrow down by choosing a word that tests multiple letters? But we only have one blank to fill. \n\n   Since we have to fill position 2, we cannot avoid testing only one letter per guess.\n\n   So I\'ll guess ""short"".\n\n   Therefore, next guess: ""short""\n\n   But let me explain: from the deduction, we have the word as S?ORT with ? being a letter that is not A, I, E, M. Additionally, from the feedback, we know T must be at position 5 because it has to be somewhere and only that position is available. Thus, I am confirming by guessing ""short"", which has H at position 2.\n\n   If incorrect, we can try others.\n\n   But we have a good chance.\n\n   Alternatively, we might be missing something: in guess 1, we had S present but not at position 4. In our structure, S is at 1 and not at 4, good. And R is at 4, not at 1, good.\n\n   Now, for position 2, we need a letter. So ""short"" seems a valid choice.\n\n   Final decision: guess ""short"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- From Guess 1 (""raise""): R and S are in the secret word, but not in position 1 and 4 respectively. A, I, and E are absent.\n- From Guess 2 (""storm""): S, O, and R are in their correct positions (1, 3, 4). T is present but not in position 2. M is absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Secret word structure**: S _ O R _  \n   - Position 1: ✓ S  \n   - Position 3: ✓ O  \n   - Position 4: ✓ R  \n   - Position 2: Must be an unknown letter (not A, I, E, M, T).  \n   - Position 5: Must be T (since T is present and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).  \n\n2. **Known absent letters**: A, E, I, M.  \n3. **Possible words**: With S _ O R T, the only valid English words are ""short"", ""snort"", ""sport"", or ""skort"" (depending on letter 2: H, N, P, or K).  \n\n### Strategy for this guess:\n- Guess ""short"" to verify if H is the missing letter. It matches all feedback constraints and covers a common possibility.  \n- If incorrect, future guesses can narrow down other letters (N, P, K) for position 2.\n\n<guess>short</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: storm -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(✓) R(✓) M(x)\nGuess 3: short -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: raise**
- R: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- A: `x` (not in word)
- I: `x` (not in word)
- S: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- E: `x` (not in word)

**Guess 2: storm**
- S: `✓` (correct position)
- T: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- O: `✓` (correct position)
- R: `✓` (correct position)
- M: `x` (not in word)

**Guess 3: short**
- S: `✓` (correct position)
- H: `x` (not in word)
- O: `✓` (correct position)
- R: `✓` (correct position)
- T: `✓` (correct position)

### Analysis:
1. **Correct letters and positions (from Guess 2 and 3):**
   - Position 1: S (confirmed by both)
   - Position 3: O (confirmed by both)
   - Position 4: R (confirmed by both)
   - Position 5: T (confirmed by Guess 3: T is ✓ at position 5)

   Therefore, the secret word is: S _ O R T, with only position 2 unknown.

2. **Absent letters (from all guesses):**
   - A, I, E (from Guess 1)
   - M (from Guess 2)
   - H (from Guess 3)

   So absent: A, E, I, M, H.

3. **Position 2 constraints:**
   - Must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - Must form a valid English word: S?ORT.

### Possible words:
We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S?ORT, where ? is a letter not in {A, E, I, M, H}.

Common possibilities:
- ""snort"": S N O R T → N is not absent? We haven't tested N.
- ""sport"": S P O R T → P not tested.
- ""skort"": S K O R T → K not tested.

Other rare words? But we'll stick to common ones.

### Feedback from Guess 3:
In ""short"", we guessed H at position 2 and it was `x` (absent). So H is not in the word, and not at position 2.

But we already know position 2 must be filled by a letter that is not absent.

### Next step:
Since we have only one letter to determine, we can try one of the possibilities.

We have three main candidates: ""snort"" (N), ""sport"" (P), ""skort"" (K).

We can choose the most common word, which is ""snort"" or ""sport"".

But note: in Guess 2, we had T at position 2 and it was `-` (wrong position), but we now know T is at position 5. That doesn't affect position 2.

We need to guess a word that tests the missing letter.

### Decision:
I'll go with ""snort"" because it's a common word and we haven't tested N yet.

If not, we can try ""sport"" next.

But we are on the fourth guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we could think if there is any other constraint.

From Guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` (wrong position). In the secret word, R is at position 4, which is consistent.

Similarly, S was at position 4 in Guess 1 and marked `-` (wrong position), but now it's at position 1, consistent.

No other constraints.

So, let's guess ""snort"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""snort"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Secret word structure**: The word is S _ O R T, with only the second letter unknown.
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 1: S (correct in all guesses)
  - Position 3: O (correct in Guess 2 and 3)
  - Position 4: R (correct in Guess 2 and 3)
  - Position 5: T (correct in Guess 3)
- **Absent letters**: A, E, I, M (from Guess 1 and 2), and H (from Guess 3). These cannot appear in the word.

The unknown letter (position 2) must be a letter not in {A, E, I, M, H} and form a valid English word. Common possibilities include:
- **N** (e.g., ""snort"")
- **P** (e.g., ""sport"")
- **K** (e.g., ""skort"")

For this guess, I prioritize **""snort""** because:
- It tests the common letter **N** (not yet evaluated in previous guesses).
- It aligns with the feedback constraints and is a high-frequency word.
- If incorrect, it will confirm or rule out N, narrowing options for the next guess.

<guess>snort</guess>",snort,"We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: raise**
- R: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- A: `x` (not in word)
- I: `x` (not in word)
- S: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- E: `x` (not in word)

**Guess 2: storm**
- S: `✓` (correct position)
- T: `-` (in word, wrong position)
- O: `✓` (correct position)
- R: `✓` (correct position)
- M: `x` (not in word)

**Guess 3: short**
- S: `✓` (correct position)
- H: `x` (not in word)
- O: `✓` (correct position)
- R: `✓` (correct position)
- T: `✓` (correct position)

### Analysis:
1. **Correct letters and positions (from Guess 2 and 3):**
   - Position 1: S (confirmed by both)
   - Position 3: O (confirmed by both)
   - Position 4: R (confirmed by both)
   - Position 5: T (confirmed by Guess 3: T is ✓ at position 5)

   Therefore, the secret word is: S _ O R T, with only position 2 unknown.

2. **Absent letters (from all guesses):**
   - A, I, E (from Guess 1)
   - M (from Guess 2)
   - H (from Guess 3)

   So absent: A, E, I, M, H.

3. **Position 2 constraints:**
   - Must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - Must form a valid English word: S?ORT.

### Possible words:
We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S?ORT, where ? is a letter not in {A, E, I, M, H}.

Common possibilities:
- ""snort"": S N O R T → N is not absent? We haven't tested N.
- ""sport"": S P O R T → P not tested.
- ""skort"": S K O R T → K not tested.

Other rare words? But we'll stick to common ones.

### Feedback from Guess 3:
In ""short"", we guessed H at position 2 and it was `x` (absent). So H is not in the word, and not at position 2.

But we already know position 2 must be filled by a letter that is not absent.

### Next step:
Since we have only one letter to determine, we can try one of the possibilities.

We have three main candidates: ""snort"" (N), ""sport"" (P), ""skort"" (K).

We can choose the most common word, which is ""snort"" or ""sport"".

But note: in Guess 2, we had T at position 2 and it was `-` (wrong position), but we now know T is at position 5. That doesn't affect position 2.

We need to guess a word that tests the missing letter.

### Decision:
I'll go with ""snort"" because it's a common word and we haven't tested N yet.

If not, we can try ""sport"" next.

But we are on the fourth guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we could think if there is any other constraint.

From Guess 1: the letter R was at position 1 and marked `-` (wrong position). In the secret word, R is at position 4, which is consistent.

Similarly, S was at position 4 in Guess 1 and marked `-` (wrong position), but now it's at position 1, consistent.

No other constraints.

So, let's guess ""snort"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""snort"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Secret word structure**: The word is S _ O R T, with only the second letter unknown.
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 1: S (correct in all guesses)
  - Position 3: O (correct in Guess 2 and 3)
  - Position 4: R (correct in Guess 2 and 3)
  - Position 5: T (correct in Guess 3)
- **Absent letters**: A, E, I, M (from Guess 1 and 2), and H (from Guess 3). These cannot appear in the word.

The unknown letter (position 2) must be a letter not in {A, E, I, M, H} and form a valid English word. Common possibilities include:
- **N** (e.g., ""snort"")
- **P** (e.g., ""sport"")
- **K** (e.g., ""skort"")

For this guess, I prioritize **""snort""** because:
- It tests the common letter **N** (not yet evaluated in previous guesses).
- It aligns with the feedback constraints and is a high-frequency word.
- If incorrect, it will confirm or rule out N, narrowing options for the next guess.",Guess 4: snort -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
