We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is correct and in the right position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - C is in the word but not in the first position. So C is somewhere else in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in the fourth position. So N is somewhere else in the word.
 - R and A are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Must end with E (so the fifth letter is E).
   - Contains C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (and also not in the positions we guessed for R and A, but those are absent).
   - Does not contain R, A.

 We know the word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

 We have to avoid using R and A in our next guess.

 Also, note that C and N are present but not in the positions we tried (C was in position 1 and is not there, N was in position 4 and is not there).

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Ends with E (so last letter is E)
   - Contains C and N (but not in position 1 for C and not in position 4 for N)
   - Does not contain R or A.

 Additionally, we have 6 tries, so we want to test new letters to get more information.

 We can try to place C and N in other positions and use new letters for the rest.

 Possible positions for C: since it's not first, it can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
 Similarly, N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N can be in 1,2,3.

 However, we must avoid position 4 for N because the feedback said N is not in position 4.

 Let's try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.

 Some words that come to mind:
   - since: s-i-n-c-e -> but note: positions: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). 
     This has N in position 3 (which is allowed) and C in position 4 (which is allowed because we only know C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4). 
     Also, it doesn't have R or A.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the feedback for the first guess said that C is present but not in position 1, and N is present but not in position 4. 
 In ""since"", C is in position 4 and N in position 3. That seems okay.

 However, we also have the E in position 5 which is correct. So let's check:

   - The word ""since"" has E at the end, which matches.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S or I. We haven't tested S or I.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants and vowels we haven't tried.

 We have already eliminated R and A. We know the word has C and N, and ends with E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

   - dance: d-a-n-c-e -> but contains A (which we know is not in the word) -> invalid.
   - mince: m-i-n-c-e -> positions: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). This avoids A and R. 
   - ounce: o-u-n-c-e -> o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). Also avoids A and R.

 But note: we are allowed to use the same letter more than once? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words don't have duplicate letters unless the secret word does. 
 However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. But in our first guess, we used distinct letters, and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates. 
 But it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid duplicates for now.

 Since we are trying to get information, we might want to test more new letters.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know R and A are absent. So we can use any letters except R and A, and we know E is in the last position.

 We have 3 positions to figure out (positions 1,2,3,4) but note that we know position 5 is E. And we know the word has C and N.

 We can try to use a word that has C and N in positions we haven't tested and also tests new letters.

 Let me try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.

 Some options:
   - since: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ounce: o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests O and U.
   - mince: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests M and I.

 We might also consider words that put C and N in different positions.

 For example, C could be in position 2 or 3? And N in position 1,2, or 3? But note we have to avoid position 4 for N.

 Let's try to think of a word with C in position 2: 
   - scene: s(1), c(2), e(3), n(4), e(5) -> but note: we have two E's? and also N is in position 4 which is not allowed (feedback said N is not in position 4). So invalid.

 What about C in position 3?
   - dance: has A -> invalid.
   - hence: h(1), e(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> but note: we have E in position 2 and 5. The feedback for the first guess had E in position 5 correct, but we don't know about other E's. 
     However, the word ""hence"" has two E's. Also, we are testing H. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). 
     It doesn't say anything about other E's. So it's possible. But we also have N in position 3 and C in position 4. 
     However, the feedback for the first guess said N is not in position 4, but in ""hence"", N is in position 3 and C in position 4. That's okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess: 
   - We had ""crane"": C in position 1 (which is wrong position, but present), R (absent), A (absent), N in position 4 (wrong position, but present), E in position 5 (correct).

 So in ""hence"", we have:
   - H: new
   - E in position 2: we don't know if E is elsewhere? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know. 
   - N in position 3: we haven't tested position 3 for N. 
   - C in position 4: we haven't tested position 4 for C (only that C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4).

 However, we are about to test it.

 But note: the word ""hence"" has two E's. If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 2 would be incorrect. 
 But the feedback would then mark the E in position 2 as absent? Or if the secret word has two E's, then it might be present but in the wrong position? 

 We have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without extra E's to avoid confusion.

 Let me look for words that have C and N, end with E, and without R, A, and without an extra E.

 Words:
   - mince: m, i, n, c, e -> no extra E, and no R or A.
   - ounce: o, u, n, c, e -> same.

 I think ""mince"" or ""ounce"" are good candidates.

 We can also consider ""niche"": n(1), i(2), c(3), h(4), e(5). But note: we are putting N in position 1. 
 We don't know if N can be in position 1 because we only know it's not in position 4. 
 However, in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
 So if we put N in position 1, that's a new position for N. 

 But we also have to test C in position 3. 

 However, we want to maximize information. 

 Let me compare:

   - ""since"": tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""mince"": tests M and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""ounce"": tests O and U, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""niche"": tests N in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 3 (new), and also tests I and H.

 Since we want to test new positions for C and N, ""niche"" might be better because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new.

 But note: we know the word has C and N, but we don't know if they can be in these positions.

 However, we must avoid using R and A.

 Let me check ""niche"": letters N, I, C, H, E. No R or A. And it ends with E.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the correct position (5th). So in ""niche"", we have E in the 5th, which is correct. 
 The other letters are new.

 However, we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, C in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in a position that might be risky? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has C and N and also tests common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.

 Considering that, ""since"" (with S and I) or ""ounce"" (with O and U) might be good.

 I think I'll go with ""since"" because S is a very common letter.

 But note: we are putting N in position 3 and C in position 4. We know from the first guess that N is not in position 4 and C is not in position 1. 
 So if we get feedback that in ""since"", N is correct in position 3, then we know. Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, if the secret word has N in position 1 or 2, then in ""since"" the N would be in the wrong position? 
 But the feedback will tell us.

 Alternatively, if we use a word that has N in a position we haven't tested, we can get more information about N.

 But we have limited tries. We need to balance between testing positions and testing new letters.

 After consideration, I think ""niche"" is a good choice because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new positions, and also tests I and H.

 But let's see: if we use ""niche"", then:

   - If the secret word has N in position 1, we get a check for N.
   - If not, but N is in the word, we might get a dash for N if it's in position 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so not. So positions 2 or 3.

 Similarly for C: if not in position 3, then it must be in 2 or 4? Because we know it's not in 1.

 However, we are also testing two new letters: I and H.

 Alternatively, we can use ""mince"" to test M and I, and put N and C in positions we haven't tested? Actually, in ""mince"", N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested for C, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong).

 I think I'll go with ""mince"" because it uses common letters and avoids potential confusion with duplicate E.

 So my next guess: mince.

 But let me double-check the feedback we have: 
   - We know the word has C and N, and ends with E, and does not have R or A.

 ""mince"": M (new), I (new), N (in position 3, which we haven't tested), C (in position 4, which we haven't tested for C), E (correct in position 5).

 We hope to get information about M, I, and the positions of N and C.

 If the feedback shows:
   - If M is in the word and in position 1, we get a check. Otherwise, if M is in the word but not position 1, we get a dash. If not, an x.
   - Similarly for I in position 2.

 And for N: if it's in position 3, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in the word but not position 3, we get a dash (but we know it must be in the word, so if not check then dash). Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback, but we'll handle that.

 So I choose ""mince"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has M? We don't know. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, ... but we know A and R are out. So next are O, T, etc.

 We haven't tried T. Maybe we can try a word with T.

 For example, ""tonic"": but it doesn't end with E. We need to end with E.

 Words ending with E and containing T, C, and N? And without R and A.

   - tunic: t-u-n-i-c -> doesn't end with E.
   - ounce: we thought of, but no T.
   - mince: no T.

 How about ""hence""? But it has an extra E. 

 Or ""dunce"": d-u-n-c-e -> but has U and D, and avoids R and A. But we don't know about D and U.

 But we are trying to test T. 

 Let me think of a word that has T, ends with E, and has C and N? 

   - dance: has A -> invalid.
   - fence: f-e-n-c-e -> has two E's? and no T.
   - mince: no T.
   - since: no T.
   - ounce: no T.
   - hence: no T.

 It's hard to find one with T. 

 Another: ""truce"": t-r-u-c-e -> but has R -> invalid.

 ""tunice"" is not 5 letters.

 ""tance"" is not a word.

 So maybe T is not easy to include. 

 Alternatively, we can try ""pence"": p-e-n-c-e -> two E's? and tests P.

 But I think ""mince"" is a reasonable choice.

 I'll go with ""mince"".

<guess>mince</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E (✓)**: The letter E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **C (-)**: The letter C is in the secret word but not at position 1.
- **N (-)**: The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4.
- **R (x)**: The letter R is not in the secret word.
- **A (x)**: The letter A is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- The word contains **C** and **N**, but neither is in their guessed positions (C not at 1, N not at 4).
- The word does **not** contain **R** or **A**.
- Unknown positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (except that position 4 cannot be N).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **C** and **N** in new positions (avoiding position 1 for C and position 4 for N).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information (e.g., M, I, O, T, S).
- Avoid R and A entirely.

The word **""mince""** fits well:
- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.
- Places **N** at position 3 (a new position, not 4).
- Places **C** at position 4 (a new position for C, not 1).
- Tests new letters: **M** (position 1) and **I** (position 2).
- Avoids R and A.

This guess will help narrow down:
- Whether **M** or **I** are in the word.
- If **N** is correctly placed at position 3.
- If **C** is correctly placed at position 4.

     However, the feedback for the first guess said N is not in position 4, but in ""hence"", N is in position 3 and C in position 4. That's okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess: 
   - We had ""crane"": C in position 1 (which is wrong position, but present), R (absent), A (absent), N in position 4 (wrong position, but present), E in position 5 (correct).

 So in ""hence"", we have:
   - H: new
   - E in position 2: we don't know if E is elsewhere? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know. 
   - N in position 3: we haven't tested position 3 for N. 
   - C in position 4: we haven't tested position 4 for C (only that C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4).

 However, we are about to test it.

 But note: the word ""hence"" has two E's. If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 2 would be incorrect. 
 But the feedback would then mark the E in position 2 as absent? Or if the secret word has two E's, then it might be present but in the wrong position? 

 We have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without extra E's to avoid confusion.

 Let me look for words that have C and N, end with E, and without R, A, and without an extra E.

 Words:
   - mince: m, i, n, c, e -> no extra E, and no R or A.
   - ounce: o, u, n, c, e -> same.

 I think ""mince"" or ""ounce"" are good candidates.

 We can also consider ""niche"": n(1), i(2), c(3), h(4), e(5). But note: we are putting N in position 1. 
 We don't know if N can be in position 1 because we only know it's not in position 4. 
 However, in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
 So if we put N in position 1, that's a new position for N. 

 But we also have to test C in position 3. 

 However, we want to maximize information. 

 Let me compare:

   - ""since"": tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""mince"": tests M and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""ounce"": tests O and U, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""niche"": tests N in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 3 (new), and also tests I and H.

 Since we want to test new positions for C and N, ""niche"" might be better because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new.

 But note: we know the word has C and N, but we don't know if they can be in these positions.

 However, we must avoid using R and A.

 Let me check ""niche"": letters N, I, C, H, E. No R or A. And it ends with E.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the correct position (5th). So in ""niche"", we have E in the 5th, which is correct. 
 The other letters are new.

 However, we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, C in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in a position that might be risky? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has C and N and also tests common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.

 Considering that, ""since"" (with S and I) or ""ounce"" (with O and U) might be good.

 I think I'll go with ""since"" because S is a very common letter.

 But note: we are putting N in position 3 and C in position 4. We know from the first guess that N is not in position 4 and C is not in position 1. 
 So if we get feedback that in ""since"", N is correct in position 3, then we know. Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, if the secret word has N in position 1 or 2, then in ""since"" the N would be in the wrong position? 
 But the feedback will tell us.

 Alternatively, if we use a word that has N in a position we haven't tested, we can get more information about N.

 But we have limited tries. We need to balance between testing positions and testing new letters.

 After consideration, I think ""niche"" is a good choice because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new positions, and also tests I and H.

 But let's see: if we use ""niche"", then:

   - If the secret word has N in position 1, we get a check for N.
   - If not, but N is in the word, we might get a dash for N if it's in position 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so not. So positions 2 or 3.

 Similarly for C: if not in position 3, then it must be in 2 or 4? Because we know it's not in 1.

 However, we are also testing two new letters: I and H.

 Alternatively, we can use ""mince"" to test M and I, and put N and C in positions we haven't tested? Actually, in ""mince"", N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested for C, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong).

 I think I'll go with ""mince"" because it uses common letters and avoids potential confusion with duplicate E.

 So my next guess: mince.

 But let me double-check the feedback we have: 
   - We know the word has C and N, and ends with E, and does not have R or A.

 ""mince"": M (new), I (new), N (in position 3, which we haven't tested), C (in position 4, which we haven't tested for C), E (correct in position 5).

 We hope to get information about M, I, and the positions of N and C.

 If the feedback shows:
   - If M is in the word and in position 1, we get a check. Otherwise, if M is in the word but not position 1, we get a dash. If not, an x.
   - Similarly for I in position 2.

 And for N: if it's in position 3, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in the word but not position 3, we get a dash (but we know it must be in the word, so if not check then dash). Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback, but we'll handle that.

 So I choose ""mince"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has M? We don't know. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, ... but we know A and R are out. So next are O, T, etc.

 We haven't tried T. Maybe we can try a word with T.

 For example, ""tonic"": but it doesn't end with E. We need to end with E.

 Words ending with E and containing T, C, and N? And without R and A.

   - tunic: t-u-n-i-c -> doesn't end with E.
   - ounce: we thought of, but no T.
   - mince: no T.

 How about ""hence""? But it has an extra E. 

 Or ""dunce"": d-u-n-c-e -> but has U and D, and avoids R and A. But we don't know about D and U.

 But we are trying to test T. 

 Let me think of a word that has T, ends with E, and has C and N? 

   - dance: has A -> invalid.
   - fence: f-e-n-c-e -> has two E's? and no T.
   - mince: no T.
   - since: no T.
   - ounce: no T.
   - hence: no T.

 It's hard to find one with T. 

 Another: ""truce"": t-r-u-c-e -> but has R -> invalid.

 ""tunice"" is not 5 letters.

 ""tance"" is not a word.

 So maybe T is not easy to include. 

 Alternatively, we can try ""pence"": p-e-n-c-e -> two E's? and tests P.

 But I think ""mince"" is a reasonable choice.

 I'll go with ""mince"".

<guess>mince</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E (✓)**: The letter E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **C (-)**: The letter C is in the secret word but not at position 1.
- **N (-)**: The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4.
- **R (x)**: The letter R is not in the secret word.
- **A (x)**: The letter A is not in the secret word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).
- The word contains **C** and **N**, but neither is in their guessed positions (C not at 1, N not at 4).
- The word does **not** contain **R** or **A**.
- Unknown positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (except that position 4 cannot be N).

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **C** and **N** in new positions (avoiding position 1 for C and position 4 for N).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information (e.g., M, I, O, T, S).
- Avoid R and A entirely.

The word **""mince""** fits well:
- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.
- Places **N** at position 3 (a new position, not 4).
- Places **C** at position 4 (a new position for C, not 1).
- Tests new letters: **M** (position 1) and **I** (position 2).
- Avoids R and A.

This guess will help narrow down:
- Whether **M** or **I** are in the word.
- If **N** is correctly placed at position 3.
- If **C** is correctly placed at position 4.",Guess 2: mince -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) C(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,niece,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - E is correct and in the right position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
 - C is in the word but not in the first position. So C is somewhere else in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in the fourth position. So N is somewhere else in the word.
 - R and A are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
   - Must end with E (so the fifth letter is E).
   - Contains C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (and also not in the positions we guessed for R and A, but those are absent).
   - Does not contain R, A.

 We know the word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E

 We have to avoid using R and A in our next guess.

 Also, note that C and N are present but not in the positions we tried (C was in position 1 and is not there, N was in position 4 and is not there).

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Ends with E (so last letter is E)
   - Contains C and N (but not in position 1 for C and not in position 4 for N)
   - Does not contain R or A.

 Additionally, we have 6 tries, so we want to test new letters to get more information.

 We can try to place C and N in other positions and use new letters for the rest.

 Possible positions for C: since it's not first, it can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
 Similarly, N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N can be in 1,2,3.

 However, we must avoid position 4 for N because the feedback said N is not in position 4.

 Let's try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.

 Some words that come to mind:
   - since: s-i-n-c-e -> but note: positions: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). 
     This has N in position 3 (which is allowed) and C in position 4 (which is allowed because we only know C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4). 
     Also, it doesn't have R or A.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the feedback for the first guess said that C is present but not in position 1, and N is present but not in position 4. 
 In ""since"", C is in position 4 and N in position 3. That seems okay.

 However, we also have the E in position 5 which is correct. So let's check:

   - The word ""since"" has E at the end, which matches.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S or I. We haven't tested S or I.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants and vowels we haven't tried.

 We have already eliminated R and A. We know the word has C and N, and ends with E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

   - dance: d-a-n-c-e -> but contains A (which we know is not in the word) -> invalid.
   - mince: m-i-n-c-e -> positions: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). This avoids A and R. 
   - ounce: o-u-n-c-e -> o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). Also avoids A and R.

 But note: we are allowed to use the same letter more than once? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words don't have duplicate letters unless the secret word does. 
 However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. But in our first guess, we used distinct letters, and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates. 
 But it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid duplicates for now.

 Since we are trying to get information, we might want to test more new letters.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know R and A are absent. So we can use any letters except R and A, and we know E is in the last position.

 We have 3 positions to figure out (positions 1,2,3,4) but note that we know position 5 is E. And we know the word has C and N.

 We can try to use a word that has C and N in positions we haven't tested and also tests new letters.

 Let me try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.

 Some options:
   - since: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ounce: o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests O and U.
   - mince: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests M and I.

 We might also consider words that put C and N in different positions.

 For example, C could be in position 2 or 3? And N in position 1,2, or 3? But note we have to avoid position 4 for N.

 Let's try to think of a word with C in position 2: 
   - scene: s(1), c(2), e(3), n(4), e(5) -> but note: we have two E's? and also N is in position 4 which is not allowed (feedback said N is not in position 4). So invalid.

 What about C in position 3?
   - dance: has A -> invalid.
   - hence: h(1), e(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> but note: we have E in position 2 and 5. The feedback for the first guess had E in position 5 correct, but we don't know about other E's. 
     However, the word ""hence"" has two E's. Also, we are testing H. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). 
     It doesn't say anything about other E's. So it's possible. But we also have N in position 3 and C in position 4. 
     However, the feedback for the first guess said N is not in position 4, but in ""hence"", N is in position 3 and C in position 4. That's okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess: 
   - We had ""crane"": C in position 1 (which is wrong position, but present), R (absent), A (absent), N in position 4 (wrong position, but present), E in position 5 (correct).

 So in ""hence"", we have:
   - H: new
   - E in position 2: we don't know if E is elsewhere? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know. 
   - N in position 3: we haven't tested position 3 for N. 
   - C in position 4: we haven't tested position 4 for C (only that C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4).

 However, we are about to test it.

 But note: the word ""hence"" has two E's. If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 2 would be incorrect. 
 But the feedback would then mark the E in position 2 as absent? Or if the secret word has two E's, then it might be present but in the wrong position? 

 We have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without extra E's to avoid confusion.

 Let me look for words that have C and N, end with E, and without R, A, and without an extra E.

 Words:
   - mince: m, i, n, c, e -> no extra E, and no R or A.
   - ounce: o, u, n, c, e -> same.

 I think ""mince"" or ""ounce"" are good candidates.

 We can also consider ""niche"": n(1), i(2), c(3), h(4), e(5). But note: we are putting N in position 1. 
 We don't know if N can be in position 1 because we only know it's not in position 4. 
 However, in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
 So if we put N in position 1, that's a new position for N. 

 But we also have to test C in position 3. 

 However, we want to maximize information. 

 Let me compare:

   - ""since"": tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""mince"": tests M and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""ounce"": tests O and U, and places N in 3 and C in 4.
   - ""niche"": tests N in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 3 (new), and also tests I and H.

 Since we want to test new positions for C and N, ""niche"" might be better because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new.

 But note: we know the word has C and N, but we don't know if they can be in these positions.

 However, we must avoid using R and A.

 Let me check ""niche"": letters N, I, C, H, E. No R or A. And it ends with E.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the correct position (5th). So in ""niche"", we have E in the 5th, which is correct. 
 The other letters are new.

 However, we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that's allowed. Similarly, C in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put N in a position that might be risky? But we have to test.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has C and N and also tests common letters that we haven't tried.

 We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common consonants: T, S, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.

 Considering that, ""since"" (with S and I) or ""ounce"" (with O and U) might be good.

 I think I'll go with ""since"" because S is a very common letter.

 But note: we are putting N in position 3 and C in position 4. We know from the first guess that N is not in position 4 and C is not in position 1. 
 So if we get feedback that in ""since"", N is correct in position 3, then we know. Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, if the secret word has N in position 1 or 2, then in ""since"" the N would be in the wrong position? 
 But the feedback will tell us.

 Alternatively, if we use a word that has N in a position we haven't tested, we can get more information about N.

 But we have limited tries. We need to balance between testing positions and testing new letters.

 After consideration, I think ""niche"" is a good choice because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new positions, and also tests I and H.

 But let's see: if we use ""niche"", then:

   - If the secret word has N in position 1, we get a check for N.
   - If not, but N is in the word, we might get a dash for N if it's in position 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so not. So positions 2 or 3.

 Similarly for C: if not in position 3, then it must be in 2 or 4? Because we know it's not in 1.

 However, we are also testing two new letters: I and H.

 Alternatively, we can use ""mince"" to test M and I, and put N and C in positions we haven't tested? Actually, in ""mince"", N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven't tested for C, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong).

 I think I'll go with ""mince"" because it uses common letters and avoids potential confusion with duplicate E.

 So my next guess: mince.

 But let me double-check the feedback we have: 
   - We know the word has C and N, and ends with E, and does not have R or A.

 ""mince"": M (new), I (new), N (in position 3, which we haven't tested), C (in position 4, which we haven't tested for C), E (correct in position 5).

 We hope to get information about M, I, and the positions of N and C.

 If the feedback shows:
   - If M is in the word and in position 1, we get a check. Otherwise, if M is in the word but not position 1, we get a dash. If not, an x.
   - Similarly for I in position 2.

 And for N: if it's in position 3, we get a check. Otherwise, if it's in the word but not position 3, we get a dash (but we know it must be in the word, so if not check then dash). Similarly for C in position 4.

 However, note: if the secret word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback, but we'll handle that.

 So I choose ""mince"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has M? We don't know. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, ... but we know A and R are out. So next are O, T, etc.

 We haven't tried T. Maybe we can try a word with T.

 For example, ""tonic"": but it doesn't end with E. We need to end with E.

 Words ending with E and containing T, C, and N? And without R and A.

   - tunic: t-u-n-i-c -> doesn't end with E.
   - ounce: we thought of, but no T.
   - mince: no T.

 How about ""hence""? But it has an extra E. 

 Or ""dunce"": d-u-n-c-e -> but has U and D, and avoids R and A. But we don't know about D and U.

 But we are trying to test T. 

 Let me think of a word that has T, ends with E, and has C and N? 

   - dance: has A -> invalid.
   - fence: f-e-n-c-e -> has two E's? and no T.
   - mince: no T.
   - since: no T.
   - ounce: no T.
   - hence: no T.

 It's hard to find one with T. 

 Another: ""truce"": t-r-u-c-e -> but has R -> invalid.

 ""tunice"" is not 5 letters.

 ""tance"" is not a word.

 So maybe T is not easy to include. 

 Alternatively, we can try ""pence"": p-e-n-c-e -> two E's? and tests P.

 But I think ""mince"" is a reasonable choice.

 I'll go with ""mince"".

So the secret word ends with E.\n - C is in the word but not in the first position. So C is somewhere else in the word.\n - N is in the word but not in the fourth position. So N is somewhere else in the word.\n - R and A are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word:\n   - Must end with E (so the fifth letter is E).\n   - Contains C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (and also not in the positions we guessed for R and A, but those are absent).\n   - Does not contain R, A.\n\n We know the word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ E\n\n We have to avoid using R and A in our next guess.\n\n Also, note that C and N are present but not in the positions we tried (C was in position 1 and is not there, N was in position 4 and is not there).\n\n Let\'s think of a word that:\n   - Ends with E (so last letter is E)\n   - Contains C and N (but not in position 1 for C and not in position 4 for N)\n   - Does not contain R or A.\n\n Additionally, we have 6 tries, so we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n We can try to place C and N in other positions and use new letters for the rest.\n\n Possible positions for C: since it\'s not first, it can be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n Similarly, N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N can be in 1,2,3.\n\n However, we must avoid position 4 for N because the feedback said N is not in position 4.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n   - since: s-i-n-c-e -> but note: positions: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). \n     This has N in position 3 (which is allowed) and C in position 4 (which is allowed because we only know C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4). \n     Also, it doesn\'t have R or A.\n\n But wait, we also have to consider that the feedback for the first guess said that C is present but not in position 1, and N is present but not in position 4. \n In ""since"", C is in position 4 and N in position 3. That seems okay.\n\n However, we also have the E in position 5 which is correct. So let\'s check:\n\n   - The word ""since"" has E at the end, which matches.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S or I. We haven\'t tested S or I.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants and vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\n We have already eliminated R and A. We know the word has C and N, and ends with E.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities:\n\n   - dance: d-a-n-c-e -> but contains A (which we know is not in the word) -> invalid.\n   - mince: m-i-n-c-e -> positions: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). This avoids A and R. \n   - ounce: o-u-n-c-e -> o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5). Also avoids A and R.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use the same letter more than once? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words don\'t have duplicate letters unless the secret word does. \n However, we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. But in our first guess, we used distinct letters, and the feedback didn\'t indicate duplicates. \n But it\'s possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Since we are trying to get information, we might want to test more new letters.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know R and A are absent. So we can use any letters except R and A, and we know E is in the last position.\n\n We have 3 positions to figure out (positions 1,2,3,4) but note that we know position 5 is E. And we know the word has C and N.\n\n We can try to use a word that has C and N in positions we haven\'t tested and also tests new letters.\n\n Let me try to think of words that end with E and have C and N, without R and A.\n\n Some options:\n   - since: s(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.\n   - ounce: o(1), u(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests O and U.\n   - mince: m(1), i(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> tests M and I.\n\n We might also consider words that put C and N in different positions.\n\n For example, C could be in position 2 or 3? And N in position 1,2, or 3? But note we have to avoid position 4 for N.\n\n Let\'s try to think of a word with C in position 2: \n   - scene: s(1), c(2), e(3), n(4), e(5) -> but note: we have two E\'s? and also N is in position 4 which is not allowed (feedback said N is not in position 4). So invalid.\n\n What about C in position 3?\n   - dance: has A -> invalid.\n   - hence: h(1), e(2), n(3), c(4), e(5) -> but note: we have E in position 2 and 5. The feedback for the first guess had E in position 5 correct, but we don\'t know about other E\'s. \n     However, the word ""hence"" has two E\'s. Also, we are testing H. But note: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). \n     It doesn\'t say anything about other E\'s. So it\'s possible. But we also have N in position 3 and C in position 4. \n     However, the feedback for the first guess said N is not in position 4, but in ""hence"", N is in position 3 and C in position 4. That\'s okay.\n\n But wait, the feedback for the first guess: \n   - We had ""crane"": C in position 1 (which is wrong position, but present), R (absent), A (absent), N in position 4 (wrong position, but present), E in position 5 (correct).\n\n So in ""hence"", we have:\n   - H: new\n   - E in position 2: we don\'t know if E is elsewhere? The secret word might have only one E? But we don\'t know. \n   - N in position 3: we haven\'t tested position 3 for N. \n   - C in position 4: we haven\'t tested position 4 for C (only that C is not in position 1 and N not in position 4).\n\n However, we are about to test it.\n\n But note: the word ""hence"" has two E\'s. If the secret word has only one E (at the end), then the E in position 2 would be incorrect. \n But the feedback would then mark the E in position 2 as absent? Or if the secret word has two E\'s, then it might be present but in the wrong position? \n\n We have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word without extra E\'s to avoid confusion.\n\n Let me look for words that have C and N, end with E, and without R, A, and without an extra E.\n\n Words:\n   - mince: m, i, n, c, e -> no extra E, and no R or A.\n   - ounce: o, u, n, c, e -> same.\n\n I think ""mince"" or ""ounce"" are good candidates.\n\n We can also consider ""niche"": n(1), i(2), c(3), h(4), e(5). But note: we are putting N in position 1. \n We don\'t know if N can be in position 1 because we only know it\'s not in position 4. \n However, in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n So if we put N in position 1, that\'s a new position for N. \n\n But we also have to test C in position 3. \n\n However, we want to maximize information. \n\n Let me compare:\n\n   - ""since"": tests S and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.\n   - ""mince"": tests M and I, and places N in 3 and C in 4.\n   - ""ounce"": tests O and U, and places N in 3 and C in 4.\n   - ""niche"": tests N in position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and C in position 3 (new), and also tests I and H.\n\n Since we want to test new positions for C and N, ""niche"" might be better because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new.\n\n But note: we know the word has C and N, but we don\'t know if they can be in these positions.\n\n However, we must avoid using R and A.\n\n Let me check ""niche"": letters N, I, C, H, E. No R or A. And it ends with E.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that E is in the correct position (5th). So in ""niche"", we have E in the 5th, which is correct. \n The other letters are new.\n\n However, we are putting N in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. Similarly, C in position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put N in a position that might be risky? But we have to test.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has C and N and also tests common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common consonants: T, S, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.\n\n Considering that, ""since"" (with S and I) or ""ounce"" (with O and U) might be good.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""since"" because S is a very common letter.\n\n But note: we are putting N in position 3 and C in position 4. We know from the first guess that N is not in position 4 and C is not in position 1. \n So if we get feedback that in ""since"", N is correct in position 3, then we know. Similarly for C in position 4.\n\n However, if the secret word has N in position 1 or 2, then in ""since"" the N would be in the wrong position? \n But the feedback will tell us.\n\n Alternatively, if we use a word that has N in a position we haven\'t tested, we can get more information about N.\n\n But we have limited tries. We need to balance between testing positions and testing new letters.\n\n After consideration, I think ""niche"" is a good choice because it tests N in position 1 and C in position 3, which are new positions, and also tests I and H.\n\n But let\'s see: if we use ""niche"", then:\n\n   - If the secret word has N in position 1, we get a check for N.\n   - If not, but N is in the word, we might get a dash for N if it\'s in position 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so not. So positions 2 or 3.\n\n Similarly for C: if not in position 3, then it must be in 2 or 4? Because we know it\'s not in 1.\n\n However, we are also testing two new letters: I and H.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""mince"" to test M and I, and put N and C in positions we haven\'t tested? Actually, in ""mince"", N is in position 3 (which we haven\'t tested) and C in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested for C, but we tested N in position 4 and it was wrong).\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""mince"" because it uses common letters and avoids potential confusion with duplicate E.\n\n So my next guess: mince.\n\n But let me double-check the feedback we have: \n   - We know the word has C and N, and ends with E, and does not have R or A.\n\n ""mince"": M (new), I (new), N (in position 3, which we haven\'t tested), C (in position 4, which we haven\'t tested for C), E (correct in position 5).\n\n We hope to get information about M, I, and the positions of N and C.\n\n If the feedback shows:\n   - If M is in the word and in position 1, we get a check. Otherwise, if M is in the word but not position 1, we get a dash. If not, an x.\n   - Similarly for I in position 2.\n\n And for N: if it\'s in position 3, we get a check. Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but not position 3, we get a dash (but we know it must be in the word, so if not check then dash). Similarly for C in position 4.\n\n However, note: if the secret word has duplicate letters, we might get unexpected feedback, but we\'ll handle that.\n\n So I choose ""mince"".\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has M? We don\'t know. We are testing it.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, ... but we know A and R are out. So next are O, T, etc.\n\n We haven\'t tried T. Maybe we can try a word with T.\n\n For example, ""tonic"": but it doesn\'t end with E. We need to end with E.\n\n Words ending with E and containing T, C, and N? And without R and A.\n\n   - tunic: t-u-n-i-c -> doesn\'t end with E.\n   - ounce: we thought of, but no T.\n   - mince: no T.\n\n How about ""hence""? But it has an extra E. \n\n Or ""dunce"": d-u-n-c-e -> but has U and D, and avoids R and A. But we don\'t know about D and U.\n\n But we are trying to test T. \n\n Let me think of a word that has T, ends with E, and has C and N? \n\n   - dance: has A -> invalid.\n   - fence: f-e-n-c-e -> has two E\'s? and no T.\n   - mince: no T.\n   - since: no T.\n   - ounce: no T.\n   - hence: no T.\n\n It\'s hard to find one with T. \n\n Another: ""truce"": t-r-u-c-e -> but has R -> invalid.\n\n ""tunice"" is not 5 letters.\n\n ""tance"" is not a word.\n\n So maybe T is not easy to include. \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""pence"": p-e-n-c-e -> two E\'s? and tests P.\n\n But I think ""mince"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n I\'ll go with ""mince"".\n\n<guess>mince</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E (✓)**: The letter E is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 5.\n- **C (-)**: The letter C is in the secret word but not at position 1.\n- **N (-)**: The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4.\n- **R (x)**: The letter R is not in the secret word.\n- **A (x)**: The letter A is not in the secret word.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word ends with **E** (position 5).\n- The word contains **C** and **N**, but neither is in their guessed positions (C not at 1, N not at 4).\n- The word does **not** contain **R** or **A**.\n- Unknown positions: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (except that position 4 cannot be N).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing **C** and **N** in new positions (avoiding position 1 for C and position 4 for N).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information (e.g., M, I, O, T, S).\n- Avoid R and A entirely.\n\nThe word **""mince""** fits well:\n- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.\n- Places **N** at position 3 (a new position, not 4).\n- Places **C** at position 4 (a new position for C, not 1).\n- Tests new letters: **M** (position 1) and **I** (position 2).\n- Avoids R and A.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down:\n- Whether **M** or **I** are in the word.\n- If **N** is correctly placed at position 3.\n- If **C** is correctly placed at position 4.\n\n<guess>mince</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: mince -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) N(-) C(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
     - C is in the word but not in the 1st position.
     - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
     - R and A are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: ""mince"" -> M(x), I(✓), N(-), C(✓), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - I is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
     - C is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th) - already known.
     - M is not in the word.
     - N is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Now, combining the information:

- Positions:
  - Position 5: E (fixed)
  - Position 2: I (fixed, from guess 2)
  - Position 4: C (fixed, from guess 2)
  
- So we know: _ I _ C E

- Additionally:
  - The secret word contains N (from guess 1) and it is not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). 
    Since positions 2 and 4 are already taken by I and C, and position 5 by E, the only remaining positions for N are 1 and ... 
    The positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know:
      - Position 2: I (fixed)
      - Position 4: C (fixed)
      - Position 5: E (fixed)
      - Position 3 and 1 are open. But N cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) or position 4 (from guess 1). 
        So N must be in position 1? 
    Wait: we have position 3 open and position 1 open. But in guess 2, N was in position 3 and we got a dash, meaning N is in the word but not at position 3. 
    Similarly, in guess 1, N was in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning not there. 
    Therefore, the only position left for N is position 1? 

  Let me list the positions:
    Position 1: unknown
    Position 2: I (fixed)
    Position 3: unknown
    Position 4: C (fixed)
    Position 5: E (fixed)

  We know N is present. Since it cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (and positions 2 and 5 are fixed), the only possibility is position 1.

  Therefore, position 1 must be N? 

  But wait: could N be in the word twice? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicate letters. However, the rules don't forbid duplicates. 
  But if there were two N's, then in guess 2, when we put N in position 3, we might get a dash even if one N is in position 1? 
  However, we haven't tested position 1 for N. 

  So let's think: 
    - From guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4 -> so it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 2 is I (so not N) and position 5 is E (so not N). So possible positions: 1 or 3.

  But from guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 3 -> so that leaves only position 1.

  Therefore, unless there are duplicates, N must be in position 1. But if there are duplicates, we might have N in position 1 and also elsewhere? 

  However, note that in guess 2, we already have a dash for N meaning there is at least one N elsewhere. If there were two N's, we might have a dash for the duplicate even if one is in the word but not in the tested position. But the key is that we know from the absence in positions 3 and 4 that the other N must be in position 1.

  Therefore, I think we can confidently set position 1 as N.

  So the word starts with N? Then we have: N I _ C E

- Now, we are missing position 3.

- We also know:
  - The word does not contain R, A (from guess 1), and M (from guess 2).
  - We have used: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and M, I, N, C, E (from guess 2). So we have covered: A, C, E, I, M, N, R.

  The missing letter in position 3 must be a letter not in {A, R, M} and also not in {C, E, I, N}? But wait, the word might have duplicates? But we already have N and C, and the missing letter is one letter.

  Let me list the known used letters: 
    First guess: c, r, a, n, e -> so we know A, R are absent; C, N, E present.
    Second guess: m, i, n, c, e -> so we know M is absent; I, C, E present (and we already knew C and E from first guess, and now I is added).

  Therefore, the word contains: N, I, C, E and one more letter at position 3.

  And that letter must not be A, R, M, and also not the ones we know are absent? But we have only guesses two words.

  Also, we know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

  So we have: N I ? C E

  We need to find a letter for position 3 that completes a word.

  Possible words: 
    - nice: N I C E -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters: ""N I ? C E"". So we have 5 letters: the third letter must be a letter between I and C.

  Words ending with ""CE"": 
    - The pattern is N I X C E, where X is a letter.

  Common words:
    - niche: N I C H E -> but note that this would be N I C H E, meaning C is positions 3? But we have position 4 fixed as C? So no, if we write:

      Position 1: N
      Position 2: I
      Position 3: ?
      Position 4: C
      Position 5: E

  In ""niche"", it is N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). But that would put C in position 3, but we have feedback that C is in position 4? Contradiction.

  So no.

  We need a word that has the pattern: N I _ C E

  Let me think: 
    - The only common word I can think of is ""NICHE"" but it doesn't fit because in ""NICHE"", C is at position 3, not 4.

  What other words?

  We can consider:
    - nince -> not a word.
    - nitec -> not a word.

  Let me search: 
    - voice: V O I C E -> but that's O at position 2? No.

  Not many words fit the pattern NI_XCE.

  Another possibility: 
    - niece: N I E C E -> but this has two E's? And we have position 3 as E? But wait, our feedback from the first guess had E only at position 5? 

  Let me try ""niece"": 
    - N(1), I(2), E(3) -> but we have C at position 4? In ""niece"", the C is at position 4? 
      Actually, ""niece"" is spelled: N-I-E-C-E -> so position 1: N, position 2: I, position 3: E, position 4: C, position 5: E.

    This matches the pattern: N I E C E.

  Now, let's check against the feedback:

  From guess 1 (""crane""):
    - C was in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""niece"", C is at position 4 -> so it should be okay.
    - N was in the word but not at position 4 -> in ""niece"", N is at position 1 -> okay.
    - E at position 5 -> correct.
    - And R and A are absent -> okay.

  From guess 2 (""mince""):
    - M absent -> okay.
    - I at position 2 -> correct.
    - N at position 3: we put N at position 3? In ""mince"", our guess was M-I-N-C-E -> so N at position 3. But the secret word ""niece"" has E at position 3, no N? 

      So if the secret word is ""niece"", then in guess 2 (""mince""):
        - M: not present -> x (correct)
        - I: at position 2: present and correct -> ✓ (correct)
        - N: present in the word? In ""niece"", N is only at position 1. So when we put N at position 3 in ""mince"", the secret word has no N at position 3? But there is an N at position 1? So we should get a dash for N? 
          However, the feedback said N(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. Which matches: the N exists but at position 1 (so dash).

        - C: in the word at position 4? In ""mince"", we put C at position 4 and in ""niece"", C is at position 4 -> ✓.
        - E: ✓ for position 5.

      So feedback for ""mince"": M(x), I(✓), N(-), C(✓), E(✓) -> matches.

  Therefore, ""niece"" is a candidate.

  But wait: we have N in position 1, and that matches our reasoning.

  But are there other possibilities?

  Let me think: 

    We have N I ? C E

    What can be in ? 

    We know that the letter at ? must be a letter that is in the word? Or it could be absent? 

    But note: in the word, we already have five letters: N, I, ?, C, E. And we have the positions fixed except for ? at position 3.

    The missing letter must complete the word.

    We also have constraints: 
      - The word must contain N (but we already have N at position 1) and the ? is the only letter not yet tested? 
      - However, we know from guess 1 and guess 2 that the word has C, N, E, and I. 

    So the fifth letter is ? at position 3.

    We must choose a letter that forms a word.

    Possibilities:
      - If we put E at position 3: ""niece"" -> which we saw.
      - Other letters: 
          - niche: but that would be N I C at position 3? -> but then position 4 would be C? That would be duplicate C? And also, we have feedback from guess 2: C was correct at position 4. If we put C at position 3 as well? 

          However, for ""niche"", the letters are N, I, C, H, E. So positions: 
            Position 1: N
            Position 2: I
            Position 3: C
            Position 4: H
            Position 5: E

          But that would mean position 4 is H, not C? But we have feedback that position 4 is C? Contradiction.

      - Other words: 
          - nixe: not a word.
          - nisce: not a word.

      - How about ""vice""? but that would not have the N.

      Alternatively, ""knice"": not a word.

    Another common word: ""niece"" seems the only word that fits? 

    But note: in ""niece"", there are two E's: one at position 3 and one at position 5. 

    How does that align with the feedback?

    In guess 1 (""crane""): 
        - We had E at position 5 -> marked correct. 
        - We didn't have an E in the first guess at position 3? 
          But when we guessed ""crane"", we had E only at position 5. The secret word ""niece"" has two E's, so there is an E at position 3 that wasn't guessed. 

        That is okay because we only guessed one E.

    In guess 2 (""mince""):
        - We had E only at position 5 -> marked correct. 
        - The secret word has E at position 3 and 5, but we didn't guess position 3 as E? 
          So that doesn't conflict.

    So the secret word must be ""niece"".

    But wait, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we are at guess 2. We are going to make guess 3.

    But before we guess ""niece"", we must be cautious because there might be other words?

    Alternative: there could be a word with a different letter at position 3? For example, if we consider duplicates? 

    Suppose the word has two N's? 
      Then N could be at position 1 and position 3? But in guess 2, we put N at position 3 and we got a dash? That would mean: if there were an N at position 3, we should have gotten a check? But we got a dash meaning that N is in the word but not at position 3. 

    Therefore, position 3 cannot be N.

    Similarly, could C be at position 3? But we know C is fixed at position 4. If there were two C's, then having C at position 3 would be wrong? Then in guess 2 we got a dash for position 3? Actually, we didn't test C at position 3.

    However, in guess 2, for position 3 we tested N. We didn't test C at position 3.

    But we know from guess 1 that C is in the word, and from guess 2 that C is at position 4.

    So if we put a C at position 3, that would be a duplicate? 

    But let me see: the word ""niece"" does not have duplicate C? Only one C at position 4.

    So duplicates? 

    There might be words like ""since"": but ""since"" is S-I-N-C-E -> which would be N at position 3? But we got a dash for N at position 3? So if the secret word were ""since"", then in guess 2 (""mince"") we put N at position 3 and the secret word has N at position 3? Then we should have gotten a check? But we got a dash -> so ""since"" cannot be the secret word.

    Therefore, the only candidate I see is ""niece"".

    But note: is ""niece"" a word? Yes, meaning a daughter of one's sibling.

    So we can guess ""niece"" now.

    Alternatively, we should consider if there are other words? 

    Let me try to think: 
        Another word: ""bice"", but that's not 5 letters.

      ""dice"", same.

      ""nice"": 4 letters.

      ""kice"": not a word.

      ""lice"": 4 letters.

      ""mice"": 4 letters? Or ""mice"" is 4.

      ""pice"": not 5.

      ""rice"": 4.

      ""sice"": not common.

      ""tice"": not 5.

      ""wice"": not common.

      So ""niece"" seems the only one.

    Therefore, our next guess should be ""niece"".

    But note: we have to check the pattern: 
      Position 1: N (if correct then ✓)
      Position 2: I (already ✓)
      Position 3: E? In ""niece"", it's E at position 3 -> we don't know yet, but we hope.
      Position 4: C (✓)
      Position 5: E (✓)

    So if we guess ""niece"", we expect:
        N(✓) I(✓) E(?) C(✓) E(✓) -> and E at position 3 might be a dash or check? 

    But we know the secret word has E only at position 5? Or the secret word may have more E's? 

    Actually, we don't know about other E's. But in guess 1, we did not test other positions for E.

    So here goes.

    We'll guess ""niece"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:
- **Crane**: Revealed E is correctly placed at position 5, C and N are present (but not in positions 1 and 4), and R/A are absent.
- **Mince**: Confirmed I is correctly placed at position 2, C is correctly placed at position 4, and E is correct at position 5. Additionally, M is absent, and N is present but not in position 3.

Critical deductions:
- The secret word follows the pattern: **? I ? C E** (positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as I, C, and E).
- N must be in the word: 
  - It cannot be in position 3 (per ""mince"" feedback) or position 4 (per ""crane"" feedback).
  - Positions 2 (I) and 5 (E) are fixed, leaving only position 1 for N. Thus, position 1 must be N.
- The word structure is now: **N I ? C E**.
- Position 3 must be a new letter not yet tested (excluding absent letters A, R, M).

Testing the only valid English word fitting **N I ? C E**:
- **Niece** fits: N(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5).
- Validation:
- Position 3 (E) is logical and consistent with existing feedback (no prior E in position 3 tested).
- Matches all constraints: Contains N, I, C, E; avoids A, R, M; and aligns with positional feedback.

<guess>niece</guess>",niece,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
     - C is in the word but not in the 1st position.
     - N is in the word but not in the 4th position.
     - R and A are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: ""mince"" -> M(x), I(✓), N(-), C(✓), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - I is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
     - C is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
     - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th) - already known.
     - M is not in the word.
     - N is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

Now, combining the information:

- Positions:
  - Position 5: E (fixed)
  - Position 2: I (fixed, from guess 2)
  - Position 4: C (fixed, from guess 2)
  
- So we know: _ I _ C E

- Additionally:
  - The secret word contains N (from guess 1) and it is not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). 
    Since positions 2 and 4 are already taken by I and C, and position 5 by E, the only remaining positions for N are 1 and ... 
    The positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know:
      - Position 2: I (fixed)
      - Position 4: C (fixed)
      - Position 5: E (fixed)
      - Position 3 and 1 are open. But N cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) or position 4 (from guess 1). 
        So N must be in position 1? 
    Wait: we have position 3 open and position 1 open. But in guess 2, N was in position 3 and we got a dash, meaning N is in the word but not at position 3. 
    Similarly, in guess 1, N was in position 4 and we got a dash, meaning not there. 
    Therefore, the only position left for N is position 1? 

  Let me list the positions:
    Position 1: unknown
    Position 2: I (fixed)
    Position 3: unknown
    Position 4: C (fixed)
    Position 5: E (fixed)

  We know N is present. Since it cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (and positions 2 and 5 are fixed), the only possibility is position 1.

  Therefore, position 1 must be N? 

  But wait: could N be in the word twice? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicate letters. However, the rules don't forbid duplicates. 
  But if there were two N's, then in guess 2, when we put N in position 3, we might get a dash even if one N is in position 1? 
  However, we haven't tested position 1 for N. 

  So let's think: 
    - From guess 1: N is in the word but not in position 4 -> so it could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5? But position 2 is I (so not N) and position 5 is E (so not N). So possible positions: 1 or 3.

  But from guess 2: N is in the word but not in position 3 -> so that leaves only position 1.

  Therefore, unless there are duplicates, N must be in position 1. But if there are duplicates, we might have N in position 1 and also elsewhere? 

  However, note that in guess 2, we already have a dash for N meaning there is at least one N elsewhere. If there were two N's, we might have a dash for the duplicate even if one is in the word but not in the tested position. But the key is that we know from the absence in positions 3 and 4 that the other N must be in position 1.

  Therefore, I think we can confidently set position 1 as N.

  So the word starts with N? Then we have: N I _ C E

- Now, we are missing position 3.

- We also know:
  - The word does not contain R, A (from guess 1), and M (from guess 2).
  - We have used: C, R, A, N, E (from guess 1) and M, I, N, C, E (from guess 2). So we have covered: A, C, E, I, M, N, R.

  The missing letter in position 3 must be a letter not in {A, R, M} and also not in {C, E, I, N}? But wait, the word might have duplicates? But we already have N and C, and the missing letter is one letter.

  Let me list the known used letters: 
    First guess: c, r, a, n, e -> so we know A, R are absent; C, N, E present.
    Second guess: m, i, n, c, e -> so we know M is absent; I, C, E present (and we already knew C and E from first guess, and now I is added).

  Therefore, the word contains: N, I, C, E and one more letter at position 3.

  And that letter must not be A, R, M, and also not the ones we know are absent? But we have only guesses two words.

  Also, we know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

  So we have: N I ? C E

  We need to find a letter for position 3 that completes a word.

  Possible words: 
    - nice: N I C E -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters: ""N I ? C E"". So we have 5 letters: the third letter must be a letter between I and C.

  Words ending with ""CE"": 
    - The pattern is N I X C E, where X is a letter.

  Common words:
    - niche: N I C H E -> but note that this would be N I C H E, meaning C is positions 3? But we have position 4 fixed as C? So no, if we write:

      Position 1: N
      Position 2: I
      Position 3: ?
      Position 4: C
      Position 5: E

  In ""niche"", it is N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). But that would put C in position 3, but we have feedback that C is in position 4? Contradiction.

  So no.

  We need a word that has the pattern: N I _ C E

  Let me think: 
    - The only common word I can think of is ""NICHE"" but it doesn't fit because in ""NICHE"", C is at position 3, not 4.

  What other words?

  We can consider:
    - nince -> not a word.
    - nitec -> not a word.

  Let me search: 
    - voice: V O I C E -> but that's O at position 2? No.

  Not many words fit the pattern NI_XCE.

  Another possibility: 
    - niece: N I E C E -> but this has two E's? And we have position 3 as E? But wait, our feedback from the first guess had E only at position 5? 

  Let me try ""niece"": 
    - N(1), I(2), E(3) -> but we have C at position 4? In ""niece"", the C is at position 4? 
      Actually, ""niece"" is spelled: N-I-E-C-E -> so position 1: N, position 2: I, position 3: E, position 4: C, position 5: E.

    This matches the pattern: N I E C E.

  Now, let's check against the feedback:

  From guess 1 (""crane""):
    - C was in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""niece"", C is at position 4 -> so it should be okay.
    - N was in the word but not at position 4 -> in ""niece"", N is at position 1 -> okay.
    - E at position 5 -> correct.
    - And R and A are absent -> okay.

  From guess 2 (""mince""):
    - M absent -> okay.
    - I at position 2 -> correct.
    - N at position 3: we put N at position 3? In ""mince"", our guess was M-I-N-C-E -> so N at position 3. But the secret word ""niece"" has E at position 3, no N? 

      So if the secret word is ""niece"", then in guess 2 (""mince""):
        - M: not present -> x (correct)
        - I: at position 2: present and correct -> ✓ (correct)
        - N: present in the word? In ""niece"", N is only at position 1. So when we put N at position 3 in ""mince"", the secret word has no N at position 3? But there is an N at position 1? So we should get a dash for N? 
          However, the feedback said N(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. Which matches: the N exists but at position 1 (so dash).

        - C: in the word at position 4? In ""mince"", we put C at position 4 and in ""niece"", C is at position 4 -> ✓.
        - E: ✓ for position 5.

      So feedback for ""mince"": M(x), I(✓), N(-), C(✓), E(✓) -> matches.

  Therefore, ""niece"" is a candidate.

  But wait: we have N in position 1, and that matches our reasoning.

  But are there other possibilities?

  Let me think: 

    We have N I ? C E

    What can be in ? 

    We know that the letter at ? must be a letter that is in the word? Or it could be absent? 

    But note: in the word, we already have five letters: N, I, ?, C, E. And we have the positions fixed except for ? at position 3.

    The missing letter must complete the word.

    We also have constraints: 
      - The word must contain N (but we already have N at position 1) and the ? is the only letter not yet tested? 
      - However, we know from guess 1 and guess 2 that the word has C, N, E, and I. 

    So the fifth letter is ? at position 3.

    We must choose a letter that forms a word.

    Possibilities:
      - If we put E at position 3: ""niece"" -> which we saw.
      - Other letters: 
          - niche: but that would be N I C at position 3? -> but then position 4 would be C? That would be duplicate C? And also, we have feedback from guess 2: C was correct at position 4. If we put C at position 3 as well? 

          However, for ""niche"", the letters are N, I, C, H, E. So positions: 
            Position 1: N
            Position 2: I
            Position 3: C
            Position 4: H
            Position 5: E

          But that would mean position 4 is H, not C? But we have feedback that position 4 is C? Contradiction.

      - Other words: 
          - nixe: not a word.
          - nisce: not a word.

      - How about ""vice""? but that would not have the N.

      Alternatively, ""knice"": not a word.

    Another common word: ""niece"" seems the only word that fits? 

    But note: in ""niece"", there are two E's: one at position 3 and one at position 5. 

    How does that align with the feedback?

    In guess 1 (""crane""): 
        - We had E at position 5 -> marked correct. 
        - We didn't have an E in the first guess at position 3? 
          But when we guessed ""crane"", we had E only at position 5. The secret word ""niece"" has two E's, so there is an E at position 3 that wasn't guessed. 

        That is okay because we only guessed one E.

    In guess 2 (""mince""):
        - We had E only at position 5 -> marked correct. 
        - The secret word has E at position 3 and 5, but we didn't guess position 3 as E? 
          So that doesn't conflict.

    So the secret word must be ""niece"".

    But wait, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we are at guess 2. We are going to make guess 3.

    But before we guess ""niece"", we must be cautious because there might be other words?

    Alternative: there could be a word with a different letter at position 3? For example, if we consider duplicates? 

    Suppose the word has two N's? 
      Then N could be at position 1 and position 3? But in guess 2, we put N at position 3 and we got a dash? That would mean: if there were an N at position 3, we should have gotten a check? But we got a dash meaning that N is in the word but not at position 3. 

    Therefore, position 3 cannot be N.

    Similarly, could C be at position 3? But we know C is fixed at position 4. If there were two C's, then having C at position 3 would be wrong? Then in guess 2 we got a dash for position 3? Actually, we didn't test C at position 3.

    However, in guess 2, for position 3 we tested N. We didn't test C at position 3.

    But we know from guess 1 that C is in the word, and from guess 2 that C is at position 4.

    So if we put a C at position 3, that would be a duplicate? 

    But let me see: the word ""niece"" does not have duplicate C? Only one C at position 4.

    So duplicates? 

    There might be words like ""since"": but ""since"" is S-I-N-C-E -> which would be N at position 3? But we got a dash for N at position 3? So if the secret word were ""since"", then in guess 2 (""mince"") we put N at position 3 and the secret word has N at position 3? Then we should have gotten a check? But we got a dash -> so ""since"" cannot be the secret word.

    Therefore, the only candidate I see is ""niece"".

    But note: is ""niece"" a word? Yes, meaning a daughter of one's sibling.

    So we can guess ""niece"" now.

    Alternatively, we should consider if there are other words? 

    Let me try to think: 
        Another word: ""bice"", but that's not 5 letters.

      ""dice"", same.

      ""nice"": 4 letters.

      ""kice"": not a word.

      ""lice"": 4 letters.

      ""mice"": 4 letters? Or ""mice"" is 4.

      ""pice"": not 5.

      ""rice"": 4.

      ""sice"": not common.

      ""tice"": not 5.

      ""wice"": not common.

      So ""niece"" seems the only one.

    Therefore, our next guess should be ""niece"".

    But note: we have to check the pattern: 
      Position 1: N (if correct then ✓)
      Position 2: I (already ✓)
      Position 3: E? In ""niece"", it's E at position 3 -> we don't know yet, but we hope.
      Position 4: C (✓)
      Position 5: E (✓)

    So if we guess ""niece"", we expect:
        N(✓) I(✓) E(?) C(✓) E(✓) -> and E at position 3 might be a dash or check? 

    But we know the secret word has E only at position 5? Or the secret word may have more E's? 

    Actually, we don't know about other E's. But in guess 1, we did not test other positions for E.

    So here goes.

    We'll guess ""niece"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:
- **Crane**: Revealed E is correctly placed at position 5, C and N are present (but not in positions 1 and 4), and R/A are absent.
- **Mince**: Confirmed I is correctly placed at position 2, C is correctly placed at position 4, and E is correct at position 5. Additionally, M is absent, and N is present but not in position 3.

Critical deductions:
