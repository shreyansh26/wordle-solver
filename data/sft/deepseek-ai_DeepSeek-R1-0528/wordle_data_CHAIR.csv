We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and A are in the correct positions (so the first letter is C, and the third letter is A).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position? Wait, no: the feedback says R(-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the positions are 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Since C and A are correct, and R is present but not in position 2, then R must be in one of the other positions? However, positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken by C, A, and E is absent? Wait: the feedback says E(x) meaning E is not in the word at all.

 Let's break down the secret word:
 - Position 1 is C (because C is ✓)
 - Position 3 is A (because A is ✓)

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5? But wait: we have only 5 positions.

 However, note the feedback for each letter:
   Guess: C R A N E
   Feedback: ✓ - ✓ x x

 This means:
   The secret word has C in the first position and A in the third position.
   R is present somewhere, but not in the second position. Since positions 1 and 3 are already taken (and are C and A, respectively), R must be in position 4 or 5? But note: we must avoid the known absent letters: N and E are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain N or E.

 Also, since R is not in position 2, and we know position 1 is C, position 3 is A, then R must be in position 2? Wait no, because the feedback for R is ""-"" meaning it's present but not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be R, and since we know it's not in position 1 (which is fixed as C) and position 3 is fixed as A, then R must be in position 4 or 5? But wait, we don't know about positions 4 and 5 yet. However, we also know that the secret word contains R somewhere else.

 But note: the word is 5 letters. We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: A
   We don't know position 2, position 4, or position 5.

 We also know that:
   The secret word does not contain N or E (so positions 2,4,5 cannot be N or E and must be from the remaining letters).

 Moreover, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position? Wait, but what about the second position? We don't know whether the secret word has a letter at position 2 that is not R? How about the other positions?

 Let me list the knowns:
   Known correct: 
        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A

   Present but wrong position: R (so R is either in pos4 or pos5? Since we don't have it at pos2 and pos1 is C and pos3 is A, so it must be in the last two positions).

   Absent: N, E (so these letters are not in the word at all).

 Therefore, the word has the form: C _ A _ _

 And we must use R in either the fourth or fifth position? Actually, we don't know about the second position: it could be any letter (as long as it's not N, E, and it must not be R? No: wait, R is in the word but not in position 2. So the second position must be a letter that is not C, R, A, N, E? Wait, not necessarily: it could be a duplicate? But in the first guess we used distinct letters. However, the secret word could have duplicates? The rules don't say anything against duplicates. But typically, Wordle answers don't have duplicates? Actually, they sometimes do. So we must consider the possibility.

 However, in this feedback, we have:
   We know the secret word has R and it's not in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is C and position 3 is A, so those are set.

 But note: if there were duplicate R's, then R might be present in multiple positions? However, the feedback only shows for each occurrence: we have R marked as present but in the wrong position. Since we only guessed one R, we know there is at least one R in the word. But it could be that there are more? Then again, without more information, we should consider the minimal.

 So the word pattern: 
   Letter1: C
   Letter2: ? (this letter must not be R? Because if it were R, then the feedback for R at position2 would be ✓ but we got a '-', meaning it should be R but not in that position? Actually, if the secret word had R at position2, then we would have had R(✓). But we got R(-), meaning that R is in the word but not in position 2. So the letter at position2 is not R.

 Similarly, we cannot have R at position1 or position3? Position1 is C and position3 is A, so they can't be R. So R must be in position4 or position5.

 Additionally, we know that the letter N and E are absent? So the word does not contain N or E at any position? So the entire word does not have N or E.

 What about the other letters? We have only guessed one R, so we know R is present.

 Now, let's form for the next guess:

 Goals of the next guess:
   We want to get more information about the unknown letters: positions 2, 4, and 5.
   We also want to confirm the existence of R and where it might be? Or find other common letters.

 We must include R in the guess? Actually, no: we already know R is present? We are trying to find its position? But we can also try to get more information about other letters. Alternatively, we can try to place R.

 Since we know that in the secret word, R is either in position4 or 5, we can try to make a word that:

   Has the first letter C and third letter A (because we know they are fixed).
   Does not use N or E? Because they are absent.
   Must include R? Actually, no: we can omit R in the guess? But then we might not get information about R's position? However, we already know R is present. But guess can have different letters? We don't have to reuse R? Actually, we can reuse letters? The previous feedback tells us that R is present? But we might try to confirm? Or we might try to use a word without R to test other letters? However, we want to deduce the exact word.

 Approach:

 Let me consider: we know positions 1 and 3: C and A.

 Available positions: 2, 4, 5.

 Constraints: 
   The word must have an R in either 4 or 5? And the remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are not N or E, and also not C or A? Or duplicates are allowed? Actually, we don't know yet.

 We can try to form a word that has the pattern: C ? A ? R?

 But note: we don't know if R is at the fourth or the fifth. We could also consider that the secret word might have two R's? But without more feedback, it's hard.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at both position4 and position5? That is impossible? Unless we use the same word? And we don't have to? Actually, we can test R at one of these positions.

 Let me think of words that have the pattern C _ A _ _ and contain an R? And exclude N and E? And the second letter? It cannot be R? So what can it be?

 Let me list possible letters for the second position? It must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out? But we haven't tested many letters? Only C, R, A, N, E? So all others are fair game? And for positions 4 and 5: one of them must be R? And the other must be a letter that is not N, E? But also, the entire word must be valid.

 Considering common words:

   ""C"" in first, ""A"" in third:

   The second letter: can be many? Let's see:

   Some possibilities: 
      e.g., CRABS? But we have R in the feedback? And we know R isn't in position2? And CRABS would have:
          position1: C -> ✓
          position2: R -> if we guess R in position2, but we know it should be present but not in position2? Actually, we cannot guess R in position2 again? But we can? The feedback told us R is present? But we want to test position4 and 5.

   However, if we want to test position4 for R? Then we can set position4 as R? Then positions 1, 3, and 4: C, A, R? And position2 and position5 are unknowns? And no N, E? Let's form such a word:

   Pattern: C ? A R ?

   What words are there? Possibilities:

      Possible letter? in second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (excludes C, A, R, N, E? Actually, we haven't excluded any except N and E, and we know C and A are already used? But they are set in place? So we can use them again? Actually, we don't know: if the word has duplicate C's? But feedback for the first guess? We only guessed one C? But if the secret word had another C, then that would have been indicated? The feedback for the first guess? The C was at position1? So if the secret word had a C at any other position? Then we would have had a ""-"" for that position? But we didn't? Because our guess only had one C at position1? So we don't know about duplicates? However, the feedback shows that we have a ✓ for C? So we know there's a C and it's correctly placed? But if there were a second C? Then in the next guess? We might get more? But we are making the second guess? It's possible? But without evidence, we must assume that?

   But to be safe, let's avoid using C, A, or R again? We may want to test new letters? Or we can reuse? Since we know C and A are fixed? And R is present? But we are trying to find where R is? And the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? So it's safe to assume we can use new letters?

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that sets R at position4? Then we can see the feedback for R: if it is ✓ at position4? Then we know we have R at position4? Otherwise, we can deduce? Because R must be at position5? Then the secret word would be C?A?R? 

   However, we don't know the letter at position5? So if we set R at position4 and then leave position5? Then we might get feedback on R? And if R at position4 is correct? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if position4 is incorrect? Then R must be at position5? Then we get for R at position4: ""-"" meaning R is in the word? But we know already? And we have position5? Which might be R? Actually, if we set position4 to R? Then the word would be C?A R ? And the secret word might have R at position5? Then the fifth position? Then the fifth letter of our guess? We set it to another letter? How do we tell?

   It's complex? Maybe a better approach is to use the second guess to test more new letters? So that we can narrow down the possibilities? Instead of fixing R, we test letters for positions2,4,5.

   We can try a word that has:

        Letter1: C (already known) -> so we can set C? or we don't have to? We can? But it's fixed. So we must set position1 to C? Actually, we can choose any word? But if we don't set position1 to C? Then we won't get ✓? Then we might lose one attempt? But we have the option.

   Actually, note: we know position1 is C? So if we set it to C, we get a ✓ and we don't waste an opportunity? Also, we know position3 is A? So if we set it to A? We get ✓? That will give us two ✓ already? Then we can focus on positions 2,4,5? That sounds efficient.

   So let's make a word:

        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A
        Pos2: some new letter? Let's choose a common vowel or consonant? We haven't tried? Since the word must be 5 letters? And without N or E? And must not be R? So we choose a letter for pos2? Then for pos4 and pos5? We know one of them must be R? So we set one of them to R? And the other to a new letter? But then we only test one position? And the other position gets a new letter? If we set pos4 to R? Then the feedback for R at pos4? If ✓ then we know? If not, then R is at pos5? Then we know the word ends with R? And we can test the fifth letter? Then in the third guess? And we know pos2? Then we need to guess the last letter? 

   Alternatively, we can set both pos4 and pos5 to new letters? But then if R doesn't appear in the feedback? Then we know R is at one of these positions? But we don't know which? And then we have to test again? That may not be efficient.

   Alternatively, set R at pos5? Then we know: if ✓ on R at pos5, then we have R at the end? Otherwise, if R gets a ""-"", then it must be at pos4? Because those are the only remaining? And then we have to figure the rest?

   But if we get a '-' for R at pos5? Then R is at pos4? Then we know the entire word? Almost? Because we have pos1:C, pos3:A, pos4:R (because if we get a '-' for R at pos5, then R is at pos4, and then we know) and we have already set pos5 to a letter? Then we have? Then we get: C? A R(whatever we set at pos5)? and the feedback would tell about that letter? 

   Actually, we set:

        Word: C (pos1) + letter for pos2 + A (pos3) + new letter for pos4 + R at pos5?

   But wait, if we set pos4 to a new letter and pos5 to R? Then:

        If the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos5 would be ✓? But if the secret word has R at pos4? Then R at pos5 would be absent? Then we would get R at pos5 as (x)? But we know R is in the word? Then we would know that R must be at pos4? Because we got ✓ for R? We didn't? Then we get x? But then R is still in the word? So we must have R at pos4? Then we get for pos4: the letter we set? And the feedback for that letter? It would be either ✓ or -? 

   This becomes complicated? I think it's better to test R at one position? And also cover other common letters? To maximize information? Let's form a word that:

        Uses the known C at pos1 and A at pos3? So we set those? 
        For pos2: choose a letter that hasn't been tried? And for pos4: choose R? So we set R? Then pos5: choose another new letter? 

        This way:

          Candidate: C (pos1) + L (for example, a new letter) + A (pos3) + R (pos4) + K (another letter) -> ""CLARK""

        But note: ""CLARK"" is a word? Yes.

        Then, the feedback:

          Position1: C -> ✓ (as expected)
          Position2: L -> ??? (we don't know? if L is in the secret word? and if so? where? It might be L at position2? Then ✓? Or L is present elsewhere? Or absent? We will get feedback? Also, note: L is new? so if it's present? We know? If not? Then we know it's absent? And we can eliminate L? Similarly for K? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> ✓? If the secret word has R at position4? Then ✓? Otherwise, if R is at position5? Then we would get '-' for R? Because R would be in the word? but not at pos4? Then we know R must be at pos5? Because we set it? Then the feedback for K? If K is absent? Then we get x? Or if it's present? Then we get '-'? Or ✓?

        So let's assume:

          If we get:
             C(✓) L(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)

          What we learn:
             If L: ✓ -> then the secret word has L at position2? -> Then we know the whole word: C at1, L at2, A at3, R at4? Then what? Then we know? Then the secret word would be CLARK? But we are guessing ""CLARK""? Then ✓ all?
             Or if L get ""-"", then we know L is present? but not at position2? Then where? Position5 might contain L? Then feedback L(-), R(?) and K(?)? 

        Alternatively, if the secret word is ""C"" something at2, ""A"", and R at5? Then:

          Our guess: CLARK -> 
            C: ✓
            L: (we don't know? it might be absent? Or present? But in the secret word, if there is no L? Then it would be: x? Then we get: C(✓)L(x)A(✓)R(-)K(x) ? Then R would be '-' because R is in the secret word? At position5? But it's not in position4? So R: present but not at pos4? And L and K absent? Then we know:
                Secret word: C ? A ? ? -> doesn't contain L,K? and R is present? Since R is at pos5? Then we get R at pos4 as '-'? Then we know R is in the word? But the secret word has R at the fifth? Then our next guess? We set R at pos5? And we know the second letter? We need to find?

        This gives information? So CLARK is a valid candidate? 

   Another idea? Try a word that has more common consonants? Such as T? Or perhaps S? 

   However, we already know that C, R, A are in? And N,E are out? So we want to test other common letters? Such as T? 

   Let me choose a word that uses T? And also sets R? And avoids N,E? And sets the known C and A? 

   Possible word: ""CHART"" -> 
        C H A R T? But let's see:

        Pattern: C ? A R T -> we set R at pos4? and T at pos5?

        Why ""CHART""? 
        H is a common letter? And T is common? And we test two new letters? 

        But also, we know H hasn't been tried? We don't know about H? Similarly T? And if the secret word has H? And T? then we get? And for R at pos4? We will see? 

        The word ""CHART"" fits.

        How about ""CHARM""? Same? But then M is a letter? But we haven't tested M? 

        Alternatively, ""CLART""? Not a common word? So ""CHART"" is common?

   But note: we already know that the secret word ends with R? If R is at pos4? Or not? We don't fix the ending? 

   Actually, in CHART:
        Positions: C (1), H (2), A (3), R (4), T (5)

        If the secret word is CHART? Then perfect? But if the secret word has R at pos5? Then:

          Our guess: CHART -> would have R at pos4? and the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos4: feedback would be '-' meaning present but wrong position? Because if the secret word has R at pos5? Then we have R and it's in the word? Then: at pos4: R -> '-'? And at pos5: T? Then T might be absent? Or present? 

        Actually, if the secret word is ""C?A?R"" and one of the letters? Then in CHART:

          Position1: C -> ✓
          Position2: H -> ? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? Otherwise '-' meaning R is present but not at4? and then must be at5? Also, position5: T -> if the secret word has T? Then it would be ✓ if T is at pos5? or '-' if T is elsewhere? But we haven't seen T? 

   Given we have so many unknowns? I think testing CHART might be good? Because:

        If we get feedback: 

          C(✓), H(?), A(✓), R(?), T(?)

        Then we learn:

          The letter H? If present? Where? 
          R: either ✓ (if at pos4) or '-' (if at pos5)
          T: present or not?

        Then we can deduce:

          If R is ✓ at pos4? Then we know the fifth letter? Is T? Then we have CHART? Then we win? Or not? Because we don't know the second letter? H? We will get feedback on H? So:

          If we get: 
             H: ✓ -> then it means the secret word has H at pos2? If so and R at pos4✓? Then the entire word? Then C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(?) -> T? If T is ✓? Then it's CHART? or not?

          Or: 
             H: x? Then we know H is absent? Then the secret word doesn't contain H? So if R is ✓ at pos4? Then the T position? Then the word must be C? A R T? Then without H? So the second letter? We have to fill? And T at pos5? Then what are possibilities? 

          Similarly, if R at pos4 is not ✓? But '-'? Then we know R is at pos5? So the secret word ends with R? Then our T at pos5? It would be absent? Because we set T? And the secret word has R at pos5? Then T would be absent? Unless the word has two R's? Actually, no? Because R is at pos5? Then we have used one R? Then T? We set T? Then if T is present elsewhere? But if T is absent? Then we are done? The word? Then the secret word is C? A ? R? 

          This seems messy.

   Alternatively, let's just focus on R? And the second letter? We can set R at a particular? and the second letter? 

   Also, we don't know the second letter? So we need to test it? Therefore, we should try a word that has R at one of the unknown positions (but note: we set position1 and position3? So we have position2 and positions4,5? So if we set R at position5? Then we use position2 and position4 to test new letters? 

   For example: ""CUBAS""? Wait? But we have ? And S? 

   Actually, I think I found a better word: ""CHOIR""?
    But note: ""CHOIR"" has O? But O is a common vowel? But the problem: 
        Pattern: C H O I R -> But position3 is O? and we know that position3 must be A? So we cannot use O at position3? 

   Therefore, the word must have A at position3? We must set it? So like: C?A?? 

   Another word: ""CRAWL""? But wait: CRAWL? Then R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because the feedback told us R is present but not at position2? Then we should avoid R at position2? So CRAWL would have R at position2? That is forbidden? Because we got R(-) meaning R is not at pos2? So if we set R at pos2? Then we get: for R? We might get '-'? Meaning present? But we know already? And cannot possibly get ✓? So we waste? Also, we set R at a position we know it shouldn't be? Then it will be '-' again? Which doesn't tell us anything new? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, we choose words that do not put R at position2? 

   After considering, I think ""CHARM"" is a word? 

        C H A R M -> positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), R(4), M(5)

        We test H, R, and M? R at pos4: will tell if R is at pos4? If ✓? Then we know? If not? Then R is at pos5? And M? Then if M is present? We get information? 

   But is M common? 

   Another word: ""CHASM"" -> which has S? Common? 

        Pattern: C H A S M? 

        But then R? We are not putting R? Then we might get no information on R? We already know R is present? But we need to place it? If we don't include R? Then we won't get any R in the feedback? Then we still won't know if R is at pos4 or pos5? Then we have to guess again? 

   Therefore, we should include R? Because we need to place it? 

   So I go with ""CHARM"".

        Word: CHARM

        Feedback on ""CHARM""?
          Position1: C? ✓
          Position2: H? We don't know? Might be ✓ or not? 
          Position3: A? ✓
          Position4: R? ✓ if the secret word has R at4? or - if R is at5? 
          Position5: M? might be ✓ if secret word has M at5? Or -? Or x?

        This will give us information.

        And if the secret word is ""CHARM"", then we win? but if not? We learn.

   Another option: ""CLAR? We have to fill""?

   I think CHARM is a valid choice? 

   But note: we need to avoid letters that we know are absent? We know N and E? We avoid those? So H, A, R, M? A is already used? But it's fixed? M is new? H is new? R is present? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""CHARM"".

   Alternatively, what if the secret word is ""C"" something? Let me see: 

   Possible words that fit the pattern:

        C _ A _ _

        Without N and E? And with R in one of the last two? 

        Possibilities:

          If R in the last two? Then:

          e.g., 
           CHARD: C H A R D? But we haven't tried D? 
           CHART: C H A R T? 
           CHARK: which is not common? 
           CLAMP: C L A M P? But no R? Then what? No, then missing R? Because the word must contain R? So CLAMP? Would be impossible? Then invalid? 

          So words: CHARD, CHARE (but E is out? so no), CHARM, CHART, CHURL? but then U,L? 
          Also: COAR? C O A R but then fifth? But O? etc.

   So CHARM seems plausible? 

   So let me go with CHARM.

<guess>charm</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- The first letter must be **C** (✓).
- The third letter must be **A** (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- **N** and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word pattern is: **C _ A _ _**.

Constraints:
- **R** must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word must not contain **N** or **E**.
- The second letter cannot be **R**.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
1. Placing **R** in position 4 to test if it belongs there.
2. Using new letters for positions 2, 4, and 5 to gather more information.
3. Avoiding ruled-out letters (**N**, **E**) and ensuring **C** and **A** are correctly placed.

The word **""CHARM""** fits:
- Positions 1 and 3: **C** and **A** (✓).
- Position 2: **H** (new letter to test).
- Position 4: **R** (tests potential correct placement).
- Position 5: **M** (new letter to test).
- Avoids **N** and **E**, and places **R** safely.

This choice maximizes information about the unknown letters and **R**'s position efficiently.

<guess>charm</guess>",charm,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and A are in the correct positions (so the first letter is C, and the third letter is A).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position? Wait, no: the feedback says R(-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the positions are 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Since C and A are correct, and R is present but not in position 2, then R must be in one of the other positions? However, positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken by C, A, and E is absent? Wait: the feedback says E(x) meaning E is not in the word at all.

 Let's break down the secret word:
 - Position 1 is C (because C is ✓)
 - Position 3 is A (because A is ✓)

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5? But wait: we have only 5 positions.

 However, note the feedback for each letter:
   Guess: C R A N E
   Feedback: ✓ - ✓ x x

 This means:
   The secret word has C in the first position and A in the third position.
   R is present somewhere, but not in the second position. Since positions 1 and 3 are already taken (and are C and A, respectively), R must be in position 4 or 5? But note: we must avoid the known absent letters: N and E are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain N or E.

 Also, since R is not in position 2, and we know position 1 is C, position 3 is A, then R must be in position 2? Wait no, because the feedback for R is ""-"" meaning it's present but not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be R, and since we know it's not in position 1 (which is fixed as C) and position 3 is fixed as A, then R must be in position 4 or 5? But wait, we don't know about positions 4 and 5 yet. However, we also know that the secret word contains R somewhere else.

 But note: the word is 5 letters. We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: A
   We don't know position 2, position 4, or position 5.

 We also know that:
   The secret word does not contain N or E (so positions 2,4,5 cannot be N or E and must be from the remaining letters).

 Moreover, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position? Wait, but what about the second position? We don't know whether the secret word has a letter at position 2 that is not R? How about the other positions?

 Let me list the knowns:
   Known correct: 
        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A

   Present but wrong position: R (so R is either in pos4 or pos5? Since we don't have it at pos2 and pos1 is C and pos3 is A, so it must be in the last two positions).

   Absent: N, E (so these letters are not in the word at all).

 Therefore, the word has the form: C _ A _ _

 And we must use R in either the fourth or fifth position? Actually, we don't know about the second position: it could be any letter (as long as it's not N, E, and it must not be R? No: wait, R is in the word but not in position 2. So the second position must be a letter that is not C, R, A, N, E? Wait, not necessarily: it could be a duplicate? But in the first guess we used distinct letters. However, the secret word could have duplicates? The rules don't say anything against duplicates. But typically, Wordle answers don't have duplicates? Actually, they sometimes do. So we must consider the possibility.

 However, in this feedback, we have:
   We know the secret word has R and it's not in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is C and position 3 is A, so those are set.

 But note: if there were duplicate R's, then R might be present in multiple positions? However, the feedback only shows for each occurrence: we have R marked as present but in the wrong position. Since we only guessed one R, we know there is at least one R in the word. But it could be that there are more? Then again, without more information, we should consider the minimal.

 So the word pattern: 
   Letter1: C
   Letter2: ? (this letter must not be R? Because if it were R, then the feedback for R at position2 would be ✓ but we got a '-', meaning it should be R but not in that position? Actually, if the secret word had R at position2, then we would have had R(✓). But we got R(-), meaning that R is in the word but not in position 2. So the letter at position2 is not R.

 Similarly, we cannot have R at position1 or position3? Position1 is C and position3 is A, so they can't be R. So R must be in position4 or position5.

 Additionally, we know that the letter N and E are absent? So the word does not contain N or E at any position? So the entire word does not have N or E.

 What about the other letters? We have only guessed one R, so we know R is present.

 Now, let's form for the next guess:

 Goals of the next guess:
   We want to get more information about the unknown letters: positions 2, 4, and 5.
   We also want to confirm the existence of R and where it might be? Or find other common letters.

 We must include R in the guess? Actually, no: we already know R is present? We are trying to find its position? But we can also try to get more information about other letters. Alternatively, we can try to place R.

 Since we know that in the secret word, R is either in position4 or 5, we can try to make a word that:

   Has the first letter C and third letter A (because we know they are fixed).
   Does not use N or E? Because they are absent.
   Must include R? Actually, no: we can omit R in the guess? But then we might not get information about R's position? However, we already know R is present. But guess can have different letters? We don't have to reuse R? Actually, we can reuse letters? The previous feedback tells us that R is present? But we might try to confirm? Or we might try to use a word without R to test other letters? However, we want to deduce the exact word.

 Approach:

 Let me consider: we know positions 1 and 3: C and A.

 Available positions: 2, 4, 5.

 Constraints: 
   The word must have an R in either 4 or 5? And the remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are not N or E, and also not C or A? Or duplicates are allowed? Actually, we don't know yet.

 We can try to form a word that has the pattern: C ? A ? R?

 But note: we don't know if R is at the fourth or the fifth. We could also consider that the secret word might have two R's? But without more feedback, it's hard.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at both position4 and position5? That is impossible? Unless we use the same word? And we don't have to? Actually, we can test R at one of these positions.

 Let me think of words that have the pattern C _ A _ _ and contain an R? And exclude N and E? And the second letter? It cannot be R? So what can it be?

 Let me list possible letters for the second position? It must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out? But we haven't tested many letters? Only C, R, A, N, E? So all others are fair game? And for positions 4 and 5: one of them must be R? And the other must be a letter that is not N, E? But also, the entire word must be valid.

 Considering common words:

   ""C"" in first, ""A"" in third:

   The second letter: can be many? Let's see:

   Some possibilities: 
      e.g., CRABS? But we have R in the feedback? And we know R isn't in position2? And CRABS would have:
          position1: C -> ✓
          position2: R -> if we guess R in position2, but we know it should be present but not in position2? Actually, we cannot guess R in position2 again? But we can? The feedback told us R is present? But we want to test position4 and 5.

   However, if we want to test position4 for R? Then we can set position4 as R? Then positions 1, 3, and 4: C, A, R? And position2 and position5 are unknowns? And no N, E? Let's form such a word:

   Pattern: C ? A R ?

   What words are there? Possibilities:

      Possible letter? in second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (excludes C, A, R, N, E? Actually, we haven't excluded any except N and E, and we know C and A are already used? But they are set in place? So we can use them again? Actually, we don't know: if the word has duplicate C's? But feedback for the first guess? We only guessed one C? But if the secret word had another C, then that would have been indicated? The feedback for the first guess? The C was at position1? So if the secret word had a C at any other position? Then we would have had a ""-"" for that position? But we didn't? Because our guess only had one C at position1? So we don't know about duplicates? However, the feedback shows that we have a ✓ for C? So we know there's a C and it's correctly placed? But if there were a second C? Then in the next guess? We might get more? But we are making the second guess? It's possible? But without evidence, we must assume that?

   But to be safe, let's avoid using C, A, or R again? We may want to test new letters? Or we can reuse? Since we know C and A are fixed? And R is present? But we are trying to find where R is? And the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? So it's safe to assume we can use new letters?

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that sets R at position4? Then we can see the feedback for R: if it is ✓ at position4? Then we know we have R at position4? Otherwise, we can deduce? Because R must be at position5? Then the secret word would be C?A?R? 

   However, we don't know the letter at position5? So if we set R at position4 and then leave position5? Then we might get feedback on R? And if R at position4 is correct? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if position4 is incorrect? Then R must be at position5? Then we get for R at position4: ""-"" meaning R is in the word? But we know already? And we have position5? Which might be R? Actually, if we set position4 to R? Then the word would be C?A R ? And the secret word might have R at position5? Then the fifth position? Then the fifth letter of our guess? We set it to another letter? How do we tell?

   It's complex? Maybe a better approach is to use the second guess to test more new letters? So that we can narrow down the possibilities? Instead of fixing R, we test letters for positions2,4,5.

   We can try a word that has:

        Letter1: C (already known) -> so we can set C? or we don't have to? We can? But it's fixed. So we must set position1 to C? Actually, we can choose any word? But if we don't set position1 to C? Then we won't get ✓? Then we might lose one attempt? But we have the option.

   Actually, note: we know position1 is C? So if we set it to C, we get a ✓ and we don't waste an opportunity? Also, we know position3 is A? So if we set it to A? We get ✓? That will give us two ✓ already? Then we can focus on positions 2,4,5? That sounds efficient.

   So let's make a word:

        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A
        Pos2: some new letter? Let's choose a common vowel or consonant? We haven't tried? Since the word must be 5 letters? And without N or E? And must not be R? So we choose a letter for pos2? Then for pos4 and pos5? We know one of them must be R? So we set one of them to R? And the other to a new letter? But then we only test one position? And the other position gets a new letter? If we set pos4 to R? Then the feedback for R at pos4? If ✓ then we know? If not, then R is at pos5? Then we know the word ends with R? And we can test the fifth letter? Then in the third guess? And we know pos2? Then we need to guess the last letter? 

   Alternatively, we can set both pos4 and pos5 to new letters? But then if R doesn't appear in the feedback? Then we know R is at one of these positions? But we don't know which? And then we have to test again? That may not be efficient.

   Alternatively, set R at pos5? Then we know: if ✓ on R at pos5, then we have R at the end? Otherwise, if R gets a ""-"", then it must be at pos4? Because those are the only remaining? And then we have to figure the rest?

   But if we get a '-' for R at pos5? Then R is at pos4? Then we know the entire word? Almost? Because we have pos1:C, pos3:A, pos4:R (because if we get a '-' for R at pos5, then R is at pos4, and then we know) and we have already set pos5 to a letter? Then we have? Then we get: C? A R(whatever we set at pos5)? and the feedback would tell about that letter? 

   Actually, we set:

        Word: C (pos1) + letter for pos2 + A (pos3) + new letter for pos4 + R at pos5?

   But wait, if we set pos4 to a new letter and pos5 to R? Then:

        If the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos5 would be ✓? But if the secret word has R at pos4? Then R at pos5 would be absent? Then we would get R at pos5 as (x)? But we know R is in the word? Then we would know that R must be at pos4? Because we got ✓ for R? We didn't? Then we get x? But then R is still in the word? So we must have R at pos4? Then we get for pos4: the letter we set? And the feedback for that letter? It would be either ✓ or -? 

   This becomes complicated? I think it's better to test R at one position? And also cover other common letters? To maximize information? Let's form a word that:

        Uses the known C at pos1 and A at pos3? So we set those? 
        For pos2: choose a letter that hasn't been tried? And for pos4: choose R? So we set R? Then pos5: choose another new letter? 

        This way:

          Candidate: C (pos1) + L (for example, a new letter) + A (pos3) + R (pos4) + K (another letter) -> ""CLARK""

        But note: ""CLARK"" is a word? Yes.

        Then, the feedback:

          Position1: C -> ✓ (as expected)
          Position2: L -> ??? (we don't know? if L is in the secret word? and if so? where? It might be L at position2? Then ✓? Or L is present elsewhere? Or absent? We will get feedback? Also, note: L is new? so if it's present? We know? If not? Then we know it's absent? And we can eliminate L? Similarly for K? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> ✓? If the secret word has R at position4? Then ✓? Otherwise, if R is at position5? Then we would get '-' for R? Because R would be in the word? but not at pos4? Then we know R must be at pos5? Because we set it? Then the feedback for K? If K is absent? Then we get x? Or if it's present? Then we get '-'? Or ✓?

        So let's assume:

          If we get:
             C(✓) L(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)

          What we learn:
             If L: ✓ -> then the secret word has L at position2? -> Then we know the whole word: C at1, L at2, A at3, R at4? Then what? Then we know? Then the secret word would be CLARK? But we are guessing ""CLARK""? Then ✓ all?
             Or if L get ""-"", then we know L is present? but not at position2? Then where? Position5 might contain L? Then feedback L(-), R(?) and K(?)? 

        Alternatively, if the secret word is ""C"" something at2, ""A"", and R at5? Then:

          Our guess: CLARK -> 
            C: ✓
            L: (we don't know? it might be absent? Or present? But in the secret word, if there is no L? Then it would be: x? Then we get: C(✓)L(x)A(✓)R(-)K(x) ? Then R would be '-' because R is in the secret word? At position5? But it's not in position4? So R: present but not at pos4? And L and K absent? Then we know:
                Secret word: C ? A ? ? -> doesn't contain L,K? and R is present? Since R is at pos5? Then we get R at pos4 as '-'? Then we know R is in the word? But the secret word has R at the fifth? Then our next guess? We set R at pos5? And we know the second letter? We need to find?

        This gives information? So CLARK is a valid candidate? 

   Another idea? Try a word that has more common consonants? Such as T? Or perhaps S? 

   However, we already know that C, R, A are in? And N,E are out? So we want to test other common letters? Such as T? 

   Let me choose a word that uses T? And also sets R? And avoids N,E? And sets the known C and A? 

   Possible word: ""CHART"" -> 
        C H A R T? But let's see:

        Pattern: C ? A R T -> we set R at pos4? and T at pos5?

        Why ""CHART""? 
        H is a common letter? And T is common? And we test two new letters? 

        But also, we know H hasn't been tried? We don't know about H? Similarly T? And if the secret word has H? And T? then we get? And for R at pos4? We will see? 

        The word ""CHART"" fits.

        How about ""CHARM""? Same? But then M is a letter? But we haven't tested M? 

        Alternatively, ""CLART""? Not a common word? So ""CHART"" is common?

   But note: we already know that the secret word ends with R? If R is at pos4? Or not? We don't fix the ending? 

   Actually, in CHART:
        Positions: C (1), H (2), A (3), R (4), T (5)

        If the secret word is CHART? Then perfect? But if the secret word has R at pos5? Then:

          Our guess: CHART -> would have R at pos4? and the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos4: feedback would be '-' meaning present but wrong position? Because if the secret word has R at pos5? Then we have R and it's in the word? Then: at pos4: R -> '-'? And at pos5: T? Then T might be absent? Or present? 

        Actually, if the secret word is ""C?A?R"" and one of the letters? Then in CHART:

          Position1: C -> ✓
          Position2: H -> ? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? Otherwise '-' meaning R is present but not at4? and then must be at5? Also, position5: T -> if the secret word has T? Then it would be ✓ if T is at pos5? or '-' if T is elsewhere? But we haven't seen T? 

   Given we have so many unknowns? I think testing CHART might be good? Because:

        If we get feedback: 

          C(✓), H(?), A(✓), R(?), T(?)

        Then we learn:

          The letter H? If present? Where? 
          R: either ✓ (if at pos4) or '-' (if at pos5)
          T: present or not?

        Then we can deduce:

          If R is ✓ at pos4? Then we know the fifth letter? Is T? Then we have CHART? Then we win? Or not? Because we don't know the second letter? H? We will get feedback on H? So:

          If we get: 
             H: ✓ -> then it means the secret word has H at pos2? If so and R at pos4✓? Then the entire word? Then C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(?) -> T? If T is ✓? Then it's CHART? or not?

          Or: 
             H: x? Then we know H is absent? Then the secret word doesn't contain H? So if R is ✓ at pos4? Then the T position? Then the word must be C? A R T? Then without H? So the second letter? We have to fill? And T at pos5? Then what are possibilities? 

          Similarly, if R at pos4 is not ✓? But '-'? Then we know R is at pos5? So the secret word ends with R? Then our T at pos5? It would be absent? Because we set T? And the secret word has R at pos5? Then T would be absent? Unless the word has two R's? Actually, no? Because R is at pos5? Then we have used one R? Then T? We set T? Then if T is present elsewhere? But if T is absent? Then we are done? The word? Then the secret word is C? A ? R? 

          This seems messy.

   Alternatively, let's just focus on R? And the second letter? We can set R at a particular? and the second letter? 

   Also, we don't know the second letter? So we need to test it? Therefore, we should try a word that has R at one of the unknown positions (but note: we set position1 and position3? So we have position2 and positions4,5? So if we set R at position5? Then we use position2 and position4 to test new letters? 

   For example: ""CUBAS""? Wait? But we have ? And S? 

   Actually, I think I found a better word: ""CHOIR""?
    But note: ""CHOIR"" has O? But O is a common vowel? But the problem: 
        Pattern: C H O I R -> But position3 is O? and we know that position3 must be A? So we cannot use O at position3? 

   Therefore, the word must have A at position3? We must set it? So like: C?A?? 

   Another word: ""CRAWL""? But wait: CRAWL? Then R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because the feedback told us R is present but not at position2? Then we should avoid R at position2? So CRAWL would have R at position2? That is forbidden? Because we got R(-) meaning R is not at pos2? So if we set R at pos2? Then we get: for R? We might get '-'? Meaning present? But we know already? And cannot possibly get ✓? So we waste? Also, we set R at a position we know it shouldn't be? Then it will be '-' again? Which doesn't tell us anything new? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, we choose words that do not put R at position2? 

   After considering, I think ""CHARM"" is a word? 

        C H A R M -> positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), R(4), M(5)

        We test H, R, and M? R at pos4: will tell if R is at pos4? If ✓? Then we know? If not? Then R is at pos5? And M? Then if M is present? We get information? 

   But is M common? 

   Another word: ""CHASM"" -> which has S? Common? 

        Pattern: C H A S M? 

        But then R? We are not putting R? Then we might get no information on R? We already know R is present? But we need to place it? If we don't include R? Then we won't get any R in the feedback? Then we still won't know if R is at pos4 or pos5? Then we have to guess again? 

   Therefore, we should include R? Because we need to place it? 

   So I go with ""CHARM"".

        Word: CHARM

        Feedback on ""CHARM""?
          Position1: C? ✓
          Position2: H? We don't know? Might be ✓ or not? 
          Position3: A? ✓
          Position4: R? ✓ if the secret word has R at4? or - if R is at5? 
          Position5: M? might be ✓ if secret word has M at5? Or -? Or x?

        This will give us information.

        And if the secret word is ""CHARM"", then we win? but if not? We learn.

   Another option: ""CLAR? We have to fill""?

   I think CHARM is a valid choice? 

   But note: we need to avoid letters that we know are absent? We know N and E? We avoid those? So H, A, R, M? A is already used? But it's fixed? M is new? H is new? R is present? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""CHARM"".

   Alternatively, what if the secret word is ""C"" something? Let me see: 

   Possible words that fit the pattern:

        C _ A _ _

        Without N and E? And with R in one of the last two? 

        Possibilities:

          If R in the last two? Then:

          e.g., 
           CHARD: C H A R D? But we haven't tried D? 
           CHART: C H A R T? 
           CHARK: which is not common? 
           CLAMP: C L A M P? But no R? Then what? No, then missing R? Because the word must contain R? So CLAMP? Would be impossible? Then invalid? 

          So words: CHARD, CHARE (but E is out? so no), CHARM, CHART, CHURL? but then U,L? 
          Also: COAR? C O A R but then fifth? But O? etc.

   So CHARM seems plausible? 

   So let me go with CHARM.

<guess>charm</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- The first letter must be **C** (✓).
- The third letter must be **A** (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- **N** and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word pattern is: **C _ A _ _**.

Constraints:
- **R** must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word must not contain **N** or **E**.
- The second letter cannot be **R**.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
1. Placing **R** in position 4 to test if it belongs there.
2. Using new letters for positions 2, 4, and 5 to gather more information.
3. Avoiding ruled-out letters (**N**, **E**) and ensuring **C** and **A** are correctly placed.

The word **""CHARM""** fits:
- Positions 1 and 3: **C** and **A** (✓).
- Position 2: **H** (new letter to test).
- Position 4: **R** (tests potential correct placement).
- Position 5: **M** (new letter to test).
- Avoids **N** and **E**, and places **R** safely.

This choice maximizes information about the unknown letters and **R**'s position efficiently.",Guess 2: charm -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(-) M(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
 Feedback: C(✓), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C and A are in the correct positions (so the first letter is C, and the third letter is A).
 - R is in the word but not in the second position? Wait, no: the feedback says R(-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the positions are 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Since C and A are correct, and R is present but not in position 2, then R must be in one of the other positions? However, positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken by C, A, and E is absent? Wait: the feedback says E(x) meaning E is not in the word at all.

 Let's break down the secret word:
 - Position 1 is C (because C is ✓)
 - Position 3 is A (because A is ✓)

 Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5? But wait: we have only 5 positions.

 However, note the feedback for each letter:
   Guess: C R A N E
   Feedback: ✓ - ✓ x x

 This means:
   The secret word has C in the first position and A in the third position.
   R is present somewhere, but not in the second position. Since positions 1 and 3 are already taken (and are C and A, respectively), R must be in position 4 or 5? But note: we must avoid the known absent letters: N and E are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain N or E.

 Also, since R is not in position 2, and we know position 1 is C, position 3 is A, then R must be in position 2? Wait no, because the feedback for R is ""-"" meaning it's present but not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be R, and since we know it's not in position 1 (which is fixed as C) and position 3 is fixed as A, then R must be in position 4 or 5? But wait, we don't know about positions 4 and 5 yet. However, we also know that the secret word contains R somewhere else.

 But note: the word is 5 letters. We know:
   Position 1: C
   Position 3: A
   We don't know position 2, position 4, or position 5.

 We also know that:
   The secret word does not contain N or E (so positions 2,4,5 cannot be N or E and must be from the remaining letters).

 Moreover, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position? Wait, but what about the second position? We don't know whether the secret word has a letter at position 2 that is not R? How about the other positions?

 Let me list the knowns:
   Known correct: 
        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A

   Present but wrong position: R (so R is either in pos4 or pos5? Since we don't have it at pos2 and pos1 is C and pos3 is A, so it must be in the last two positions).

   Absent: N, E (so these letters are not in the word at all).

 Therefore, the word has the form: C _ A _ _

 And we must use R in either the fourth or fifth position? Actually, we don't know about the second position: it could be any letter (as long as it's not N, E, and it must not be R? No: wait, R is in the word but not in position 2. So the second position must be a letter that is not C, R, A, N, E? Wait, not necessarily: it could be a duplicate? But in the first guess we used distinct letters. However, the secret word could have duplicates? The rules don't say anything against duplicates. But typically, Wordle answers don't have duplicates? Actually, they sometimes do. So we must consider the possibility.

 However, in this feedback, we have:
   We know the secret word has R and it's not in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is C and position 3 is A, so those are set.

 But note: if there were duplicate R's, then R might be present in multiple positions? However, the feedback only shows for each occurrence: we have R marked as present but in the wrong position. Since we only guessed one R, we know there is at least one R in the word. But it could be that there are more? Then again, without more information, we should consider the minimal.

 So the word pattern: 
   Letter1: C
   Letter2: ? (this letter must not be R? Because if it were R, then the feedback for R at position2 would be ✓ but we got a '-', meaning it should be R but not in that position? Actually, if the secret word had R at position2, then we would have had R(✓). But we got R(-), meaning that R is in the word but not in position 2. So the letter at position2 is not R.

 Similarly, we cannot have R at position1 or position3? Position1 is C and position3 is A, so they can't be R. So R must be in position4 or position5.

 Additionally, we know that the letter N and E are absent? So the word does not contain N or E at any position? So the entire word does not have N or E.

 What about the other letters? We have only guessed one R, so we know R is present.

 Now, let's form for the next guess:

 Goals of the next guess:
   We want to get more information about the unknown letters: positions 2, 4, and 5.
   We also want to confirm the existence of R and where it might be? Or find other common letters.

 We must include R in the guess? Actually, no: we already know R is present? We are trying to find its position? But we can also try to get more information about other letters. Alternatively, we can try to place R.

 Since we know that in the secret word, R is either in position4 or 5, we can try to make a word that:

   Has the first letter C and third letter A (because we know they are fixed).
   Does not use N or E? Because they are absent.
   Must include R? Actually, no: we can omit R in the guess? But then we might not get information about R's position? However, we already know R is present. But guess can have different letters? We don't have to reuse R? Actually, we can reuse letters? The previous feedback tells us that R is present? But we might try to confirm? Or we might try to use a word without R to test other letters? However, we want to deduce the exact word.

 Approach:

 Let me consider: we know positions 1 and 3: C and A.

 Available positions: 2, 4, 5.

 Constraints: 
   The word must have an R in either 4 or 5? And the remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are not N or E, and also not C or A? Or duplicates are allowed? Actually, we don't know yet.

 We can try to form a word that has the pattern: C ? A ? R?

 But note: we don't know if R is at the fourth or the fifth. We could also consider that the secret word might have two R's? But without more feedback, it's hard.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at both position4 and position5? That is impossible? Unless we use the same word? And we don't have to? Actually, we can test R at one of these positions.

 Let me think of words that have the pattern C _ A _ _ and contain an R? And exclude N and E? And the second letter? It cannot be R? So what can it be?

 Let me list possible letters for the second position? It must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out? But we haven't tested many letters? Only C, R, A, N, E? So all others are fair game? And for positions 4 and 5: one of them must be R? And the other must be a letter that is not N, E? But also, the entire word must be valid.

 Considering common words:

   ""C"" in first, ""A"" in third:

   The second letter: can be many? Let's see:

   Some possibilities: 
      e.g., CRABS? But we have R in the feedback? And we know R isn't in position2? And CRABS would have:
          position1: C -> ✓
          position2: R -> if we guess R in position2, but we know it should be present but not in position2? Actually, we cannot guess R in position2 again? But we can? The feedback told us R is present? But we want to test position4 and 5.

   However, if we want to test position4 for R? Then we can set position4 as R? Then positions 1, 3, and 4: C, A, R? And position2 and position5 are unknowns? And no N, E? Let's form such a word:

   Pattern: C ? A R ?

   What words are there? Possibilities:

      Possible letter? in second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (excludes C, A, R, N, E? Actually, we haven't excluded any except N and E, and we know C and A are already used? But they are set in place? So we can use them again? Actually, we don't know: if the word has duplicate C's? But feedback for the first guess? We only guessed one C? But if the secret word had another C, then that would have been indicated? The feedback for the first guess? The C was at position1? So if the secret word had a C at any other position? Then we would have had a ""-"" for that position? But we didn't? Because our guess only had one C at position1? So we don't know about duplicates? However, the feedback shows that we have a ✓ for C? So we know there's a C and it's correctly placed? But if there were a second C? Then in the next guess? We might get more? But we are making the second guess? It's possible? But without evidence, we must assume that?

   But to be safe, let's avoid using C, A, or R again? We may want to test new letters? Or we can reuse? Since we know C and A are fixed? And R is present? But we are trying to find where R is? And the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know? So it's safe to assume we can use new letters?

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that sets R at position4? Then we can see the feedback for R: if it is ✓ at position4? Then we know we have R at position4? Otherwise, we can deduce? Because R must be at position5? Then the secret word would be C?A?R? 

   However, we don't know the letter at position5? So if we set R at position4 and then leave position5? Then we might get feedback on R? And if R at position4 is correct? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if position4 is incorrect? Then R must be at position5? Then we get for R at position4: ""-"" meaning R is in the word? But we know already? And we have position5? Which might be R? Actually, if we set position4 to R? Then the word would be C?A R ? And the secret word might have R at position5? Then the fifth position? Then the fifth letter of our guess? We set it to another letter? How do we tell?

   It's complex? Maybe a better approach is to use the second guess to test more new letters? So that we can narrow down the possibilities? Instead of fixing R, we test letters for positions2,4,5.

   We can try a word that has:

        Letter1: C (already known) -> so we can set C? or we don't have to? We can? But it's fixed. So we must set position1 to C? Actually, we can choose any word? But if we don't set position1 to C? Then we won't get ✓? Then we might lose one attempt? But we have the option.

   Actually, note: we know position1 is C? So if we set it to C, we get a ✓ and we don't waste an opportunity? Also, we know position3 is A? So if we set it to A? We get ✓? That will give us two ✓ already? Then we can focus on positions 2,4,5? That sounds efficient.

   So let's make a word:

        Pos1: C
        Pos3: A
        Pos2: some new letter? Let's choose a common vowel or consonant? We haven't tried? Since the word must be 5 letters? And without N or E? And must not be R? So we choose a letter for pos2? Then for pos4 and pos5? We know one of them must be R? So we set one of them to R? And the other to a new letter? But then we only test one position? And the other position gets a new letter? If we set pos4 to R? Then the feedback for R at pos4? If ✓ then we know? If not, then R is at pos5? Then we know the word ends with R? And we can test the fifth letter? Then in the third guess? And we know pos2? Then we need to guess the last letter? 

   Alternatively, we can set both pos4 and pos5 to new letters? But then if R doesn't appear in the feedback? Then we know R is at one of these positions? But we don't know which? And then we have to test again? That may not be efficient.

   Alternatively, set R at pos5? Then we know: if ✓ on R at pos5, then we have R at the end? Otherwise, if R gets a ""-"", then it must be at pos4? Because those are the only remaining? And then we have to figure the rest?

   But if we get a '-' for R at pos5? Then R is at pos4? Then we know the entire word? Almost? Because we have pos1:C, pos3:A, pos4:R (because if we get a '-' for R at pos5, then R is at pos4, and then we know) and we have already set pos5 to a letter? Then we have? Then we get: C? A R(whatever we set at pos5)? and the feedback would tell about that letter? 

   Actually, we set:

        Word: C (pos1) + letter for pos2 + A (pos3) + new letter for pos4 + R at pos5?

   But wait, if we set pos4 to a new letter and pos5 to R? Then:

        If the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos5 would be ✓? But if the secret word has R at pos4? Then R at pos5 would be absent? Then we would get R at pos5 as (x)? But we know R is in the word? Then we would know that R must be at pos4? Because we got ✓ for R? We didn't? Then we get x? But then R is still in the word? So we must have R at pos4? Then we get for pos4: the letter we set? And the feedback for that letter? It would be either ✓ or -? 

   This becomes complicated? I think it's better to test R at one position? And also cover other common letters? To maximize information? Let's form a word that:

        Uses the known C at pos1 and A at pos3? So we set those? 
        For pos2: choose a letter that hasn't been tried? And for pos4: choose R? So we set R? Then pos5: choose another new letter? 

        This way:

          Candidate: C (pos1) + L (for example, a new letter) + A (pos3) + R (pos4) + K (another letter) -> ""CLARK""

        But note: ""CLARK"" is a word? Yes.

        Then, the feedback:

          Position1: C -> ✓ (as expected)
          Position2: L -> ??? (we don't know? if L is in the secret word? and if so? where? It might be L at position2? Then ✓? Or L is present elsewhere? Or absent? We will get feedback? Also, note: L is new? so if it's present? We know? If not? Then we know it's absent? And we can eliminate L? Similarly for K? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> ✓? If the secret word has R at position4? Then ✓? Otherwise, if R is at position5? Then we would get '-' for R? Because R would be in the word? but not at pos4? Then we know R must be at pos5? Because we set it? Then the feedback for K? If K is absent? Then we get x? Or if it's present? Then we get '-'? Or ✓?

        So let's assume:

          If we get:
             C(✓) L(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)

          What we learn:
             If L: ✓ -> then the secret word has L at position2? -> Then we know the whole word: C at1, L at2, A at3, R at4? Then what? Then we know? Then the secret word would be CLARK? But we are guessing ""CLARK""? Then ✓ all?
             Or if L get ""-"", then we know L is present? but not at position2? Then where? Position5 might contain L? Then feedback L(-), R(?) and K(?)? 

        Alternatively, if the secret word is ""C"" something at2, ""A"", and R at5? Then:

          Our guess: CLARK -> 
            C: ✓
            L: (we don't know? it might be absent? Or present? But in the secret word, if there is no L? Then it would be: x? Then we get: C(✓)L(x)A(✓)R(-)K(x) ? Then R would be '-' because R is in the secret word? At position5? But it's not in position4? So R: present but not at pos4? And L and K absent? Then we know:
                Secret word: C ? A ? ? -> doesn't contain L,K? and R is present? Since R is at pos5? Then we get R at pos4 as '-'? Then we know R is in the word? But the secret word has R at the fifth? Then our next guess? We set R at pos5? And we know the second letter? We need to find?

        This gives information? So CLARK is a valid candidate? 

   Another idea? Try a word that has more common consonants? Such as T? Or perhaps S? 

   However, we already know that C, R, A are in? And N,E are out? So we want to test other common letters? Such as T? 

   Let me choose a word that uses T? And also sets R? And avoids N,E? And sets the known C and A? 

   Possible word: ""CHART"" -> 
        C H A R T? But let's see:

        Pattern: C ? A R T -> we set R at pos4? and T at pos5?

        Why ""CHART""? 
        H is a common letter? And T is common? And we test two new letters? 

        But also, we know H hasn't been tried? We don't know about H? Similarly T? And if the secret word has H? And T? then we get? And for R at pos4? We will see? 

        The word ""CHART"" fits.

        How about ""CHARM""? Same? But then M is a letter? But we haven't tested M? 

        Alternatively, ""CLART""? Not a common word? So ""CHART"" is common?

   But note: we already know that the secret word ends with R? If R is at pos4? Or not? We don't fix the ending? 

   Actually, in CHART:
        Positions: C (1), H (2), A (3), R (4), T (5)

        If the secret word is CHART? Then perfect? But if the secret word has R at pos5? Then:

          Our guess: CHART -> would have R at pos4? and the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos4: feedback would be '-' meaning present but wrong position? Because if the secret word has R at pos5? Then we have R and it's in the word? Then: at pos4: R -> '-'? And at pos5: T? Then T might be absent? Or present? 

        Actually, if the secret word is ""C?A?R"" and one of the letters? Then in CHART:

          Position1: C -> ✓
          Position2: H -> ? 
          Position3: A -> ✓
          Position4: R -> if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? Otherwise '-' meaning R is present but not at4? and then must be at5? Also, position5: T -> if the secret word has T? Then it would be ✓ if T is at pos5? or '-' if T is elsewhere? But we haven't seen T? 

   Given we have so many unknowns? I think testing CHART might be good? Because:

        If we get feedback: 

          C(✓), H(?), A(✓), R(?), T(?)

        Then we learn:

          The letter H? If present? Where? 
          R: either ✓ (if at pos4) or '-' (if at pos5)
          T: present or not?

        Then we can deduce:

          If R is ✓ at pos4? Then we know the fifth letter? Is T? Then we have CHART? Then we win? Or not? Because we don't know the second letter? H? We will get feedback on H? So:

          If we get: 
             H: ✓ -> then it means the secret word has H at pos2? If so and R at pos4✓? Then the entire word? Then C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(?) -> T? If T is ✓? Then it's CHART? or not?

          Or: 
             H: x? Then we know H is absent? Then the secret word doesn't contain H? So if R is ✓ at pos4? Then the T position? Then the word must be C? A R T? Then without H? So the second letter? We have to fill? And T at pos5? Then what are possibilities? 

          Similarly, if R at pos4 is not ✓? But '-'? Then we know R is at pos5? So the secret word ends with R? Then our T at pos5? It would be absent? Because we set T? And the secret word has R at pos5? Then T would be absent? Unless the word has two R's? Actually, no? Because R is at pos5? Then we have used one R? Then T? We set T? Then if T is present elsewhere? But if T is absent? Then we are done? The word? Then the secret word is C? A ? R? 

          This seems messy.

   Alternatively, let's just focus on R? And the second letter? We can set R at a particular? and the second letter? 

   Also, we don't know the second letter? So we need to test it? Therefore, we should try a word that has R at one of the unknown positions (but note: we set position1 and position3? So we have position2 and positions4,5? So if we set R at position5? Then we use position2 and position4 to test new letters? 

   For example: ""CUBAS""? Wait? But we have ? And S? 

   Actually, I think I found a better word: ""CHOIR""?
    But note: ""CHOIR"" has O? But O is a common vowel? But the problem: 
        Pattern: C H O I R -> But position3 is O? and we know that position3 must be A? So we cannot use O at position3? 

   Therefore, the word must have A at position3? We must set it? So like: C?A?? 

   Another word: ""CRAWL""? But wait: CRAWL? Then R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because the feedback told us R is present but not at position2? Then we should avoid R at position2? So CRAWL would have R at position2? That is forbidden? Because we got R(-) meaning R is not at pos2? So if we set R at pos2? Then we get: for R? We might get '-'? Meaning present? But we know already? And cannot possibly get ✓? So we waste? Also, we set R at a position we know it shouldn't be? Then it will be '-' again? Which doesn't tell us anything new? So we avoid? 

   Therefore, we choose words that do not put R at position2? 

   After considering, I think ""CHARM"" is a word? 

        C H A R M -> positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), R(4), M(5)

        We test H, R, and M? R at pos4: will tell if R is at pos4? If ✓? Then we know? If not? Then R is at pos5? And M? Then if M is present? We get information? 

   But is M common? 

   Another word: ""CHASM"" -> which has S? Common? 

        Pattern: C H A S M? 

        But then R? We are not putting R? Then we might get no information on R? We already know R is present? But we need to place it? If we don't include R? Then we won't get any R in the feedback? Then we still won't know if R is at pos4 or pos5? Then we have to guess again? 

   Therefore, we should include R? Because we need to place it? 

   So I go with ""CHARM"".

        Word: CHARM

        Feedback on ""CHARM""?
          Position1: C? ✓
          Position2: H? We don't know? Might be ✓ or not? 
          Position3: A? ✓
          Position4: R? ✓ if the secret word has R at4? or - if R is at5? 
          Position5: M? might be ✓ if secret word has M at5? Or -? Or x?

        This will give us information.

        And if the secret word is ""CHARM"", then we win? but if not? We learn.

   Another option: ""CLAR? We have to fill""?

   I think CHARM is a valid choice? 

   But note: we need to avoid letters that we know are absent? We know N and E? We avoid those? So H, A, R, M? A is already used? But it's fixed? M is new? H is new? R is present? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""CHARM"".

   Alternatively, what if the secret word is ""C"" something? Let me see: 

   Possible words that fit the pattern:

        C _ A _ _

        Without N and E? And with R in one of the last two? 

        Possibilities:

          If R in the last two? Then:

          e.g., 
           CHARD: C H A R D? But we haven't tried D? 
           CHART: C H A R T? 
           CHARK: which is not common? 
           CLAMP: C L A M P? But no R? Then what? No, then missing R? Because the word must contain R? So CLAMP? Would be impossible? Then invalid? 

          So words: CHARD, CHARE (but E is out? so no), CHARM, CHART, CHURL? but then U,L? 
          Also: COAR? C O A R but then fifth? But O? etc.

   So CHARM seems plausible? 

   So let me go with CHARM.

<guess>charm</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- The first letter must be **C** (✓).
- The third letter must be **A** (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- **N** and **E** are not in the word (x).

The secret word pattern is: **C _ A _ _**.

Constraints:
- **R** must be in position 4 or 5.
- The word must not contain **N** or **E**.
- The second letter cannot be **R**.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
1. Placing **R** in position 4 to test if it belongs there.
2. Using new letters for positions 2, 4, and 5 to gather more information.
3. Avoiding ruled-out letters (**N**, **E**) and ensuring **C** and **A** are correctly placed.

The word **""CHARM""** fits:
- Positions 1 and 3: **C** and **A** (✓).
- Position 2: **H** (new letter to test).
- Position 4: **R** (tests potential correct placement).
- Position 5: **M** (new letter to test).
- Avoids **N** and **E**, and places **R** safely.

This choice maximizes information about the unknown letters and **R**'s position efficiently.

Wait, no: the feedback says R(-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the positions are 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. Since C and A are correct, and R is present but not in position 2, then R must be in one of the other positions? However, positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken by C, A, and E is absent? Wait: the feedback says E(x) meaning E is not in the word at all.\n\n Let\'s break down the secret word:\n - Position 1 is C (because C is ✓)\n - Position 3 is A (because A is ✓)\n\n Since R is in the word but not in position 2, it must be in position 4 or 5? But wait: we have only 5 positions.\n\n However, note the feedback for each letter:\n   Guess: C R A N E\n   Feedback: ✓ - ✓ x x\n\n This means:\n   The secret word has C in the first position and A in the third position.\n   R is present somewhere, but not in the second position. Since positions 1 and 3 are already taken (and are C and A, respectively), R must be in position 4 or 5? But note: we must avoid the known absent letters: N and E are absent (x). So the secret word does not contain N or E.\n\n Also, since R is not in position 2, and we know position 1 is C, position 3 is A, then R must be in position 2? Wait no, because the feedback for R is ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be R, and since we know it\'s not in position 1 (which is fixed as C) and position 3 is fixed as A, then R must be in position 4 or 5? But wait, we don\'t know about positions 4 and 5 yet. However, we also know that the secret word contains R somewhere else.\n\n But note: the word is 5 letters. We know:\n   Position 1: C\n   Position 3: A\n   We don\'t know position 2, position 4, or position 5.\n\n We also know that:\n   The secret word does not contain N or E (so positions 2,4,5 cannot be N or E and must be from the remaining letters).\n\n Moreover, the secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position? Wait, but what about the second position? We don\'t know whether the secret word has a letter at position 2 that is not R? How about the other positions?\n\n Let me list the knowns:\n   Known correct: \n        Pos1: C\n        Pos3: A\n\n   Present but wrong position: R (so R is either in pos4 or pos5? Since we don\'t have it at pos2 and pos1 is C and pos3 is A, so it must be in the last two positions).\n\n   Absent: N, E (so these letters are not in the word at all).\n\n Therefore, the word has the form: C _ A _ _\n\n And we must use R in either the fourth or fifth position? Actually, we don\'t know about the second position: it could be any letter (as long as it\'s not N, E, and it must not be R? No: wait, R is in the word but not in position 2. So the second position must be a letter that is not C, R, A, N, E? Wait, not necessarily: it could be a duplicate? But in the first guess we used distinct letters. However, the secret word could have duplicates? The rules don\'t say anything against duplicates. But typically, Wordle answers don\'t have duplicates? Actually, they sometimes do. So we must consider the possibility.\n\n However, in this feedback, we have:\n   We know the secret word has R and it\'s not in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is C and position 3 is A, so those are set.\n\n But note: if there were duplicate R\'s, then R might be present in multiple positions? However, the feedback only shows for each occurrence: we have R marked as present but in the wrong position. Since we only guessed one R, we know there is at least one R in the word. But it could be that there are more? Then again, without more information, we should consider the minimal.\n\n So the word pattern: \n   Letter1: C\n   Letter2: ? (this letter must not be R? Because if it were R, then the feedback for R at position2 would be ✓ but we got a \'-\', meaning it should be R but not in that position? Actually, if the secret word had R at position2, then we would have had R(✓). But we got R(-), meaning that R is in the word but not in position 2. So the letter at position2 is not R.\n\n Similarly, we cannot have R at position1 or position3? Position1 is C and position3 is A, so they can\'t be R. So R must be in position4 or position5.\n\n Additionally, we know that the letter N and E are absent? So the word does not contain N or E at any position? So the entire word does not have N or E.\n\n What about the other letters? We have only guessed one R, so we know R is present.\n\n Now, let\'s form for the next guess:\n\n Goals of the next guess:\n   We want to get more information about the unknown letters: positions 2, 4, and 5.\n   We also want to confirm the existence of R and where it might be? Or find other common letters.\n\n We must include R in the guess? Actually, no: we already know R is present? We are trying to find its position? But we can also try to get more information about other letters. Alternatively, we can try to place R.\n\n Since we know that in the secret word, R is either in position4 or 5, we can try to make a word that:\n\n   Has the first letter C and third letter A (because we know they are fixed).\n   Does not use N or E? Because they are absent.\n   Must include R? Actually, no: we can omit R in the guess? But then we might not get information about R\'s position? However, we already know R is present. But guess can have different letters? We don\'t have to reuse R? Actually, we can reuse letters? The previous feedback tells us that R is present? But we might try to confirm? Or we might try to use a word without R to test other letters? However, we want to deduce the exact word.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let me consider: we know positions 1 and 3: C and A.\n\n Available positions: 2, 4, 5.\n\n Constraints: \n   The word must have an R in either 4 or 5? And the remaining two positions must be filled with letters that are not N or E, and also not C or A? Or duplicates are allowed? Actually, we don\'t know yet.\n\n We can try to form a word that has the pattern: C ? A ? R?\n\n But note: we don\'t know if R is at the fourth or the fifth. We could also consider that the secret word might have two R\'s? But without more feedback, it\'s hard.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at both position4 and position5? That is impossible? Unless we use the same word? And we don\'t have to? Actually, we can test R at one of these positions.\n\n Let me think of words that have the pattern C _ A _ _ and contain an R? And exclude N and E? And the second letter? It cannot be R? So what can it be?\n\n Let me list possible letters for the second position? It must be a letter that hasn\'t been ruled out? But we haven\'t tested many letters? Only C, R, A, N, E? So all others are fair game? And for positions 4 and 5: one of them must be R? And the other must be a letter that is not N, E? But also, the entire word must be valid.\n\n Considering common words:\n\n   ""C"" in first, ""A"" in third:\n\n   The second letter: can be many? Let\'s see:\n\n   Some possibilities: \n      e.g., CRABS? But we have R in the feedback? And we know R isn\'t in position2? And CRABS would have:\n          position1: C -> ✓\n          position2: R -> if we guess R in position2, but we know it should be present but not in position2? Actually, we cannot guess R in position2 again? But we can? The feedback told us R is present? But we want to test position4 and 5.\n\n   However, if we want to test position4 for R? Then we can set position4 as R? Then positions 1, 3, and 4: C, A, R? And position2 and position5 are unknowns? And no N, E? Let\'s form such a word:\n\n   Pattern: C ? A R ?\n\n   What words are there? Possibilities:\n\n      Possible letter? in second position: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? (excludes C, A, R, N, E? Actually, we haven\'t excluded any except N and E, and we know C and A are already used? But they are set in place? So we can use them again? Actually, we don\'t know: if the word has duplicate C\'s? But feedback for the first guess? We only guessed one C? But if the secret word had another C, then that would have been indicated? The feedback for the first guess? The C was at position1? So if the secret word had a C at any other position? Then we would have had a ""-"" for that position? But we didn\'t? Because our guess only had one C at position1? So we don\'t know about duplicates? However, the feedback shows that we have a ✓ for C? So we know there\'s a C and it\'s correctly placed? But if there were a second C? Then in the next guess? We might get more? But we are making the second guess? It\'s possible? But without evidence, we must assume that?\n\n   But to be safe, let\'s avoid using C, A, or R again? We may want to test new letters? Or we can reuse? Since we know C and A are fixed? And R is present? But we are trying to find where R is? And the secret word might have duplicates? But we don\'t know? So it\'s safe to assume we can use new letters?\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that sets R at position4? Then we can see the feedback for R: if it is ✓ at position4? Then we know we have R at position4? Otherwise, we can deduce? Because R must be at position5? Then the secret word would be C?A?R? \n\n   However, we don\'t know the letter at position5? So if we set R at position4 and then leave position5? Then we might get feedback on R? And if R at position4 is correct? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if position4 is incorrect? Then R must be at position5? Then we get for R at position4: ""-"" meaning R is in the word? But we know already? And we have position5? Which might be R? Actually, if we set position4 to R? Then the word would be C?A R ? And the secret word might have R at position5? Then the fifth position? Then the fifth letter of our guess? We set it to another letter? How do we tell?\n\n   It\'s complex? Maybe a better approach is to use the second guess to test more new letters? So that we can narrow down the possibilities? Instead of fixing R, we test letters for positions2,4,5.\n\n   We can try a word that has:\n\n        Letter1: C (already known) -> so we can set C? or we don\'t have to? We can? But it\'s fixed. So we must set position1 to C? Actually, we can choose any word? But if we don\'t set position1 to C? Then we won\'t get ✓? Then we might lose one attempt? But we have the option.\n\n   Actually, note: we know position1 is C? So if we set it to C, we get a ✓ and we don\'t waste an opportunity? Also, we know position3 is A? So if we set it to A? We get ✓? That will give us two ✓ already? Then we can focus on positions 2,4,5? That sounds efficient.\n\n   So let\'s make a word:\n\n        Pos1: C\n        Pos3: A\n        Pos2: some new letter? Let\'s choose a common vowel or consonant? We haven\'t tried? Since the word must be 5 letters? And without N or E? And must not be R? So we choose a letter for pos2? Then for pos4 and pos5? We know one of them must be R? So we set one of them to R? And the other to a new letter? But then we only test one position? And the other position gets a new letter? If we set pos4 to R? Then the feedback for R at pos4? If ✓ then we know? If not, then R is at pos5? Then we know the word ends with R? And we can test the fifth letter? Then in the third guess? And we know pos2? Then we need to guess the last letter? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set both pos4 and pos5 to new letters? But then if R doesn\'t appear in the feedback? Then we know R is at one of these positions? But we don\'t know which? And then we have to test again? That may not be efficient.\n\n   Alternatively, set R at pos5? Then we know: if ✓ on R at pos5, then we have R at the end? Otherwise, if R gets a ""-"", then it must be at pos4? Because those are the only remaining? And then we have to figure the rest?\n\n   But if we get a \'-\' for R at pos5? Then R is at pos4? Then we know the entire word? Almost? Because we have pos1:C, pos3:A, pos4:R (because if we get a \'-\' for R at pos5, then R is at pos4, and then we know) and we have already set pos5 to a letter? Then we have? Then we get: C? A R(whatever we set at pos5)? and the feedback would tell about that letter? \n\n   Actually, we set:\n\n        Word: C (pos1) + letter for pos2 + A (pos3) + new letter for pos4 + R at pos5?\n\n   But wait, if we set pos4 to a new letter and pos5 to R? Then:\n\n        If the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos5 would be ✓? But if the secret word has R at pos4? Then R at pos5 would be absent? Then we would get R at pos5 as (x)? But we know R is in the word? Then we would know that R must be at pos4? Because we got ✓ for R? We didn\'t? Then we get x? But then R is still in the word? So we must have R at pos4? Then we get for pos4: the letter we set? And the feedback for that letter? It would be either ✓ or -? \n\n   This becomes complicated? I think it\'s better to test R at one position? And also cover other common letters? To maximize information? Let\'s form a word that:\n\n        Uses the known C at pos1 and A at pos3? So we set those? \n        For pos2: choose a letter that hasn\'t been tried? And for pos4: choose R? So we set R? Then pos5: choose another new letter? \n\n        This way:\n\n          Candidate: C (pos1) + L (for example, a new letter) + A (pos3) + R (pos4) + K (another letter) -> ""CLARK""\n\n        But note: ""CLARK"" is a word? Yes.\n\n        Then, the feedback:\n\n          Position1: C -> ✓ (as expected)\n          Position2: L -> ??? (we don\'t know? if L is in the secret word? and if so? where? It might be L at position2? Then ✓? Or L is present elsewhere? Or absent? We will get feedback? Also, note: L is new? so if it\'s present? We know? If not? Then we know it\'s absent? And we can eliminate L? Similarly for K? \n          Position3: A -> ✓\n          Position4: R -> ✓? If the secret word has R at position4? Then ✓? Otherwise, if R is at position5? Then we would get \'-\' for R? Because R would be in the word? but not at pos4? Then we know R must be at pos5? Because we set it? Then the feedback for K? If K is absent? Then we get x? Or if it\'s present? Then we get \'-\'? Or ✓?\n\n        So let\'s assume:\n\n          If we get:\n             C(✓) L(?) A(✓) R(?) K(?)\n\n          What we learn:\n             If L: ✓ -> then the secret word has L at position2? -> Then we know the whole word: C at1, L at2, A at3, R at4? Then what? Then we know? Then the secret word would be CLARK? But we are guessing ""CLARK""? Then ✓ all?\n             Or if L get ""-"", then we know L is present? but not at position2? Then where? Position5 might contain L? Then feedback L(-), R(?) and K(?)? \n\n        Alternatively, if the secret word is ""C"" something at2, ""A"", and R at5? Then:\n\n          Our guess: CLARK -> \n            C: ✓\n            L: (we don\'t know? it might be absent? Or present? But in the secret word, if there is no L? Then it would be: x? Then we get: C(✓)L(x)A(✓)R(-)K(x) ? Then R would be \'-\' because R is in the secret word? At position5? But it\'s not in position4? So R: present but not at pos4? And L and K absent? Then we know:\n                Secret word: C ? A ? ? -> doesn\'t contain L,K? and R is present? Since R is at pos5? Then we get R at pos4 as \'-\'? Then we know R is in the word? But the secret word has R at the fifth? Then our next guess? We set R at pos5? And we know the second letter? We need to find?\n\n        This gives information? So CLARK is a valid candidate? \n\n   Another idea? Try a word that has more common consonants? Such as T? Or perhaps S? \n\n   However, we already know that C, R, A are in? And N,E are out? So we want to test other common letters? Such as T? \n\n   Let me choose a word that uses T? And also sets R? And avoids N,E? And sets the known C and A? \n\n   Possible word: ""CHART"" -> \n        C H A R T? But let\'s see:\n\n        Pattern: C ? A R T -> we set R at pos4? and T at pos5?\n\n        Why ""CHART""? \n        H is a common letter? And T is common? And we test two new letters? \n\n        But also, we know H hasn\'t been tried? We don\'t know about H? Similarly T? And if the secret word has H? And T? then we get? And for R at pos4? We will see? \n\n        The word ""CHART"" fits.\n\n        How about ""CHARM""? Same? But then M is a letter? But we haven\'t tested M? \n\n        Alternatively, ""CLART""? Not a common word? So ""CHART"" is common?\n\n   But note: we already know that the secret word ends with R? If R is at pos4? Or not? We don\'t fix the ending? \n\n   Actually, in CHART:\n        Positions: C (1), H (2), A (3), R (4), T (5)\n\n        If the secret word is CHART? Then perfect? But if the secret word has R at pos5? Then:\n\n          Our guess: CHART -> would have R at pos4? and the secret word has R at pos5? Then R at pos4: feedback would be \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? Because if the secret word has R at pos5? Then we have R and it\'s in the word? Then: at pos4: R -> \'-\'? And at pos5: T? Then T might be absent? Or present? \n\n        Actually, if the secret word is ""C?A?R"" and one of the letters? Then in CHART:\n\n          Position1: C -> ✓\n          Position2: H -> ? \n          Position3: A -> ✓\n          Position4: R -> if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? Otherwise \'-\' meaning R is present but not at4? and then must be at5? Also, position5: T -> if the secret word has T? Then it would be ✓ if T is at pos5? or \'-\' if T is elsewhere? But we haven\'t seen T? \n\n   Given we have so many unknowns? I think testing CHART might be good? Because:\n\n        If we get feedback: \n\n          C(✓), H(?), A(✓), R(?), T(?)\n\n        Then we learn:\n\n          The letter H? If present? Where? \n          R: either ✓ (if at pos4) or \'-\' (if at pos5)\n          T: present or not?\n\n        Then we can deduce:\n\n          If R is ✓ at pos4? Then we know the fifth letter? Is T? Then we have CHART? Then we win? Or not? Because we don\'t know the second letter? H? We will get feedback on H? So:\n\n          If we get: \n             H: ✓ -> then it means the secret word has H at pos2? If so and R at pos4✓? Then the entire word? Then C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(?) -> T? If T is ✓? Then it\'s CHART? or not?\n\n          Or: \n             H: x? Then we know H is absent? Then the secret word doesn\'t contain H? So if R is ✓ at pos4? Then the T position? Then the word must be C? A R T? Then without H? So the second letter? We have to fill? And T at pos5? Then what are possibilities? \n\n          Similarly, if R at pos4 is not ✓? But \'-\'? Then we know R is at pos5? So the secret word ends with R? Then our T at pos5? It would be absent? Because we set T? And the secret word has R at pos5? Then T would be absent? Unless the word has two R\'s? Actually, no? Because R is at pos5? Then we have used one R? Then T? We set T? Then if T is present elsewhere? But if T is absent? Then we are done? The word? Then the secret word is C? A ? R? \n\n          This seems messy.\n\n   Alternatively, let\'s just focus on R? And the second letter? We can set R at a particular? and the second letter? \n\n   Also, we don\'t know the second letter? So we need to test it? Therefore, we should try a word that has R at one of the unknown positions (but note: we set position1 and position3? So we have position2 and positions4,5? So if we set R at position5? Then we use position2 and position4 to test new letters? \n\n   For example: ""CUBAS""? Wait? But we have ? And S? \n\n   Actually, I think I found a better word: ""CHOIR""?\n    But note: ""CHOIR"" has O? But O is a common vowel? But the problem: \n        Pattern: C H O I R -> But position3 is O? and we know that position3 must be A? So we cannot use O at position3? \n\n   Therefore, the word must have A at position3? We must set it? So like: C?A?? \n\n   Another word: ""CRAWL""? But wait: CRAWL? Then R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because the feedback told us R is present but not at position2? Then we should avoid R at position2? So CRAWL would have R at position2? That is forbidden? Because we got R(-) meaning R is not at pos2? So if we set R at pos2? Then we get: for R? We might get \'-\'? Meaning present? But we know already? And cannot possibly get ✓? So we waste? Also, we set R at a position we know it shouldn\'t be? Then it will be \'-\' again? Which doesn\'t tell us anything new? So we avoid? \n\n   Therefore, we choose words that do not put R at position2? \n\n   After considering, I think ""CHARM"" is a word? \n\n        C H A R M -> positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), R(4), M(5)\n\n        We test H, R, and M? R at pos4: will tell if R is at pos4? If ✓? Then we know? If not? Then R is at pos5? And M? Then if M is present? We get information? \n\n   But is M common? \n\n   Another word: ""CHASM"" -> which has S? Common? \n\n        Pattern: C H A S M? \n\n        But then R? We are not putting R? Then we might get no information on R? We already know R is present? But we need to place it? If we don\'t include R? Then we won\'t get any R in the feedback? Then we still won\'t know if R is at pos4 or pos5? Then we have to guess again? \n\n   Therefore, we should include R? Because we need to place it? \n\n   So I go with ""CHARM"".\n\n        Word: CHARM\n\n        Feedback on ""CHARM""?\n          Position1: C? ✓\n          Position2: H? We don\'t know? Might be ✓ or not? \n          Position3: A? ✓\n          Position4: R? ✓ if the secret word has R at4? or - if R is at5? \n          Position5: M? might be ✓ if secret word has M at5? Or -? Or x?\n\n        This will give us information.\n\n        And if the secret word is ""CHARM"", then we win? but if not? We learn.\n\n   Another option: ""CLAR? We have to fill""?\n\n   I think CHARM is a valid choice? \n\n   But note: we need to avoid letters that we know are absent? We know N and E? We avoid those? So H, A, R, M? A is already used? But it\'s fixed? M is new? H is new? R is present? \n\n   Therefore, I\'ll guess ""CHARM"".\n\n   Alternatively, what if the secret word is ""C"" something? Let me see: \n\n   Possible words that fit the pattern:\n\n        C _ A _ _\n\n        Without N and E? And with R in one of the last two? \n\n        Possibilities:\n\n          If R in the last two? Then:\n\n          e.g., \n           CHARD: C H A R D? But we haven\'t tried D? \n           CHART: C H A R T? \n           CHARK: which is not common? \n           CLAMP: C L A M P? But no R? Then what? No, then missing R? Because the word must contain R? So CLAMP? Would be impossible? Then invalid? \n\n          So words: CHARD, CHARE (but E is out? so no), CHARM, CHART, CHURL? but then U,L? \n          Also: COAR? C O A R but then fifth? But O? etc.\n\n   So CHARM seems plausible? \n\n   So let me go with CHARM.\n\n<guess>charm</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- The first letter must be **C** (✓).\n- The third letter must be **A** (✓).\n- **R** is in the word but not in the second position (-).\n- **N** and **E** are not in the word (x).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: **C _ A _ _**.\n\nConstraints:\n- **R** must be in position 4 or 5.\n- The word must not contain **N** or **E**.\n- The second letter cannot be **R**.\n\nFor the next guess, I prioritize:\n1. Placing **R** in position 4 to test if it belongs there.\n2. Using new letters for positions 2, 4, and 5 to gather more information.\n3. Avoiding ruled-out letters (**N**, **E**) and ensuring **C** and **A** are correctly placed.\n\nThe word **""CHARM""** fits:\n- Positions 1 and 3: **C** and **A** (✓).\n- Position 2: **H** (new letter to test).\n- Position 4: **R** (tests potential correct placement).\n- Position 5: **M** (new letter to test).\n- Avoids **N** and **E**, and places **R** safely.\n\nThis choice maximizes information about the unknown letters and **R**\'s position efficiently.\n\n<guess>charm</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: charm -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(-) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is correct and in position 3.
  - N is not in the word.
  - E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""charm"" -> Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(-) M(x)
Meaning:
  - C is correct and in position 1 (again, as expected).
  - H is correct and in position 2 (this is new information).
  - A is correct and in position 3 (again).
  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we got '-' for R at position 4).
  - M is not in the word.

Now, combining the feedback:

We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: H (from the second guess)
  Position 3: A

We also know:
  - R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed (C, H, A), R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5? And we know it's not in 4? So it must be in 5? 

But wait: the word has 5 positions. We have:
  Pos1: C
  Pos2: H
  Pos3: A
  Pos4: ? 
  Pos5: ?

We know R is in the word and cannot be in pos2 or pos4? So it must be in pos5? Because pos1 is C and pos3 is A? So the only possibility is pos5? 

Also, we know that the word does not contain: N, E, M (from the feedback).

So the secret word is: C H A ? R? 

But wait: we have R at pos5? Then the word is: C H A ? R

Now, what about position4? We don't know that letter? And we know it cannot be N, E, M? 

Also, we have to consider: could there be duplicate letters? For example, could R appear twice? But we haven't seen any indication? The feedback for R in the first guess was '-' meaning present but not in pos2? And in the second guess, R was at pos4 and we got '-' meaning present but not in pos4? So if the secret word has R at pos5? Then that one R is accounted for? And if there were a duplicate R? Then we might have gotten an additional feedback? But in the second guess, we only put one R? So if the secret word had two R's? Then we would have only one R in our guess? Then the feedback would only show one R? So we don't know? But we must consider that the secret word might have two R's? However, without evidence? We can assume one R? But we must be cautious? 

But note: the feedback for the second guess: we got R(-) at pos4? That means there is at least one R? And it's not at pos4? So if the secret word has two R's? Then one is at pos5? And the other? Could be at pos4? But we set R at pos4? And we got '-'? That means that the R at pos4 is not correct? So if the secret word has R at pos4? Then we would have gotten ✓? But we didn't? So the secret word does not have R at pos4? Therefore, if there is a second R? It must be at a position we haven't set? But we have set all positions? Except we haven't set pos4? We set it to R? But it was wrong? So the secret word has a letter at pos4 that is not R? And at pos5? We set M? But M was absent? So the secret word has R at pos5? And the letter at pos4 is not R? 

Therefore, the secret word is: C H A ? R

And the missing letter at pos4? Must be a letter that is not C, H, A, R? (because we have set them? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can consider? But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate? So we can try to find a letter that is not N, E, M? And not C, H, A, R? 

So the word pattern: C H A _ R

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CHA"", ends with ""R"", and the fourth letter is not N, E, M? And also, the entire word must not have N, E, M? But the fourth letter is the only one missing? 

Common words: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> but we have I? Is I allowed? We haven't tested I? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHASM"" -> but M is absent? So no? 
  ""CHARD"" -> D? 
  ""CHARK"" -> K? 
  ""CHART"" -> T? 

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that N and E are absent? And in the second guess, we set M? and it was absent? So the word cannot have M? 

Therefore, the word must be one of: CHAIR, CHARD, CHARK, CHART, etc? 

But we must check if they are valid words? 

  CHAIR: C H A I R -> valid? 
  CHARD: C H A R D -> but wait, this has R at position4? But we know R is at position5? So CHARD would be C H A R D? Then R is at position4? But we just deduced that R must be at position5? Because we got R(-) at position4? And we know R is in the word? So if the secret word is CHARD? Then R is at position4? Then in our second guess ""CHARM"", we set position4 to R? Then we should have gotten R(✓) for position4? But we got R(-)? So that means the secret word does not have R at position4? Therefore, CHARD is impossible? 

Similarly, any word with R at position4 is impossible? Because we set R at position4 and got a '-'? Meaning R is not at position4? 

Therefore, the secret word must have R at position5? And the fourth letter is not R? 

So the word is: C H A ? R

Now, the fourth letter? It must be a letter that is not N, E, M? And not C, H, A, R? (assuming no duplicates? Because if there were a duplicate? Then we might have seen it? But we haven't? So we assume no duplicates? 

Possible letters for the fourth position: any letter except C, H, A, R, N, E, M? 

Common words: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> I at position4? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAWK"" -> not common? 
  ""CHAPT"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHART"" -> T at position4? 

But ""CHART"" has T at position4? Then the word is C H A R T? But wait: that would be positions: 
  1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:T? 
But we are saying R must be at position5? So that doesn't match? 

We need the word to end with R? So the fifth letter is R? So the word is: C H A ? R? 

So the fourth letter? Then the fifth letter is R? 

Examples: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> C H A I R -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:R -> this fits? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAFR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAPR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHABR"" -> not a word? 

Other possibilities? 
  ""CHAMR"" -> but M is absent? 
  ""CHANR"" -> N is absent? 
  ""CHAYR"" -> Y? 

But ""CHAYR"" is not a word? 

So the only common word I can think of is ""CHAIR""? 

But let me confirm: 
  In the first guess: ""crane"" -> 
      C: ✓ (position1)
      R: - (present but not at pos2? In ""CHAIR"", R is at pos5? So that matches? 
      A: ✓ (position3)
      N: x (absent? CHAIR has no N? So matches)
      E: x (absent? CHAIR has no E? So matches)

  Second guess: ""charm"" -> 
      C: ✓ (position1)
      H: ✓ (position2? In CHAIR, position2 is H? So ✓? 
      A: ✓ (position3)
      R: - (present but not at pos4? In CHAIR, R is at pos5? So it is present? But not at pos4? So we get '-'? Correct? 
      M: x (absent? CHAIR has no M? So matches)

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CHAIR""? 

But wait: are there other words? 

  ""CHARR"" -> but that would have two R's? And we set R at pos4? Then we would get for R at pos4: if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? But we got '-'? So if the secret word is ""CHARR"", then it has R at pos4 and pos5? Then when we set R at pos4? We should get ✓? But we got '-'? So that's a contradiction? 

  ""CHAFT"" -> but then the fifth letter is T? Not R? Then R would be missing? But we know R is in the word? 

  ""CHAWK"" -> no R? 

So the only common word that fits is ""CHAIR"". 

Therefore, we should guess ""CHAIR"". 

But note: we have only 6 tries? And we are on the third guess? So we can guess ""CHAIR"" and if it's correct? We win? If not? Then we learn? 

But what if it's not? Then we might have to consider other words? But I can't think of any? 

Another possibility: ""CHAVR""? Not a word? 

Or ""CHABR""? Not a word? 

So I think ""CHAIR"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHAIR"". 

<guess>chair</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
  - **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
  - **A** is correct and in position 3 (✓).  
  - **N** and **E** are absent (x).  

- **Guess 2 (""charm"")**:  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
  - **H** is correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - **A** is correct and in position 3 (✓).  
  - **R** is in the word but not in position 4 (-).  
  - **M** is absent (x).  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: **C H A _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as C, H, A).  
2. **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (per feedback). The only remaining position is **5**, so the pattern is **C H A _ R**.  
3. The fourth letter is unknown but cannot be **C, H, A, R** (no duplicates indicated) and cannot be **N, E, M** (absent per feedback).  
4. Common words fitting this pattern:  
   - **CHAIR** (I in position 4) is the only common English word that matches all constraints.  
     - Validates all feedback:  
       - ""crane"": C(✓), R(-) [R is in position 5, not 2], A(✓), N(x), E(x).  
       - ""charm"": C(✓), H(✓), A(✓), R(-) [R is in position 5, not 4], M(x).  

Given this, **CHAIR** is the most likely solution. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the fourth letter further, but no other common words fit the constraints.

<guess>chair</guess>",chair,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is correct and in position 3.
  - N is not in the word.
  - E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""charm"" -> Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) R(-) M(x)
Meaning:
  - C is correct and in position 1 (again, as expected).
  - H is correct and in position 2 (this is new information).
  - A is correct and in position 3 (again).
  - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since we got '-' for R at position 4).
  - M is not in the word.

Now, combining the feedback:

We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: H (from the second guess)
  Position 3: A

We also know:
  - R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed (C, H, A), R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5? And we know it's not in 4? So it must be in 5? 

But wait: the word has 5 positions. We have:
  Pos1: C
  Pos2: H
  Pos3: A
  Pos4: ? 
  Pos5: ?

We know R is in the word and cannot be in pos2 or pos4? So it must be in pos5? Because pos1 is C and pos3 is A? So the only possibility is pos5? 

Also, we know that the word does not contain: N, E, M (from the feedback).

So the secret word is: C H A ? R? 

But wait: we have R at pos5? Then the word is: C H A ? R

Now, what about position4? We don't know that letter? And we know it cannot be N, E, M? 

Also, we have to consider: could there be duplicate letters? For example, could R appear twice? But we haven't seen any indication? The feedback for R in the first guess was '-' meaning present but not in pos2? And in the second guess, R was at pos4 and we got '-' meaning present but not in pos4? So if the secret word has R at pos5? Then that one R is accounted for? And if there were a duplicate R? Then we might have gotten an additional feedback? But in the second guess, we only put one R? So if the secret word had two R's? Then we would have only one R in our guess? Then the feedback would only show one R? So we don't know? But we must consider that the secret word might have two R's? However, without evidence? We can assume one R? But we must be cautious? 

But note: the feedback for the second guess: we got R(-) at pos4? That means there is at least one R? And it's not at pos4? So if the secret word has two R's? Then one is at pos5? And the other? Could be at pos4? But we set R at pos4? And we got '-'? That means that the R at pos4 is not correct? So if the secret word has R at pos4? Then we would have gotten ✓? But we didn't? So the secret word does not have R at pos4? Therefore, if there is a second R? It must be at a position we haven't set? But we have set all positions? Except we haven't set pos4? We set it to R? But it was wrong? So the secret word has a letter at pos4 that is not R? And at pos5? We set M? But M was absent? So the secret word has R at pos5? And the letter at pos4 is not R? 

Therefore, the secret word is: C H A ? R

And the missing letter at pos4? Must be a letter that is not C, H, A, R? (because we have set them? But we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can consider? But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate? So we can try to find a letter that is not N, E, M? And not C, H, A, R? 

So the word pattern: C H A _ R

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CHA"", ends with ""R"", and the fourth letter is not N, E, M? And also, the entire word must not have N, E, M? But the fourth letter is the only one missing? 

Common words: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> but we have I? Is I allowed? We haven't tested I? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHASM"" -> but M is absent? So no? 
  ""CHARD"" -> D? 
  ""CHARK"" -> K? 
  ""CHART"" -> T? 

But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we know that N and E are absent? And in the second guess, we set M? and it was absent? So the word cannot have M? 

Therefore, the word must be one of: CHAIR, CHARD, CHARK, CHART, etc? 

But we must check if they are valid words? 

  CHAIR: C H A I R -> valid? 
  CHARD: C H A R D -> but wait, this has R at position4? But we know R is at position5? So CHARD would be C H A R D? Then R is at position4? But we just deduced that R must be at position5? Because we got R(-) at position4? And we know R is in the word? So if the secret word is CHARD? Then R is at position4? Then in our second guess ""CHARM"", we set position4 to R? Then we should have gotten R(✓) for position4? But we got R(-)? So that means the secret word does not have R at position4? Therefore, CHARD is impossible? 

Similarly, any word with R at position4 is impossible? Because we set R at position4 and got a '-'? Meaning R is not at position4? 

Therefore, the secret word must have R at position5? And the fourth letter is not R? 

So the word is: C H A ? R

Now, the fourth letter? It must be a letter that is not N, E, M? And not C, H, A, R? (assuming no duplicates? Because if there were a duplicate? Then we might have seen it? But we haven't? So we assume no duplicates? 

Possible letters for the fourth position: any letter except C, H, A, R, N, E, M? 

Common words: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> I at position4? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAWK"" -> not common? 
  ""CHAPT"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHART"" -> T at position4? 

But ""CHART"" has T at position4? Then the word is C H A R T? But wait: that would be positions: 
  1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:T? 
But we are saying R must be at position5? So that doesn't match? 

We need the word to end with R? So the fifth letter is R? So the word is: C H A ? R? 

So the fourth letter? Then the fifth letter is R? 

Examples: 
  ""CHAIR"" -> C H A I R -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:I, 5:R -> this fits? 
  ""CHASR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAFR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHAPR"" -> not a word? 
  ""CHABR"" -> not a word? 

Other possibilities? 
  ""CHAMR"" -> but M is absent? 
  ""CHANR"" -> N is absent? 
  ""CHAYR"" -> Y? 

But ""CHAYR"" is not a word? 

So the only common word I can think of is ""CHAIR""? 

But let me confirm: 
  In the first guess: ""crane"" -> 
      C: ✓ (position1)
      R: - (present but not at pos2? In ""CHAIR"", R is at pos5? So that matches? 
      A: ✓ (position3)
      N: x (absent? CHAIR has no N? So matches)
      E: x (absent? CHAIR has no E? So matches)

  Second guess: ""charm"" -> 
      C: ✓ (position1)
      H: ✓ (position2? In CHAIR, position2 is H? So ✓? 
      A: ✓ (position3)
      R: - (present but not at pos4? In CHAIR, R is at pos5? So it is present? But not at pos4? So we get '-'? Correct? 
      M: x (absent? CHAIR has no M? So matches)

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CHAIR""? 

But wait: are there other words? 

  ""CHARR"" -> but that would have two R's? And we set R at pos4? Then we would get for R at pos4: if the secret word has R at pos4? Then ✓? But we got '-'? So if the secret word is ""CHARR"", then it has R at pos4 and pos5? Then when we set R at pos4? We should get ✓? But we got '-'? So that's a contradiction? 

  ""CHAFT"" -> but then the fifth letter is T? Not R? Then R would be missing? But we know R is in the word? 

  ""CHAWK"" -> no R? 

So the only common word that fits is ""CHAIR"". 

Therefore, we should guess ""CHAIR"". 

But note: we have only 6 tries? And we are on the third guess? So we can guess ""CHAIR"" and if it's correct? We win? If not? Then we learn? 

But what if it's not? Then we might have to consider other words? But I can't think of any? 

Another possibility: ""CHAVR""? Not a word? 

Or ""CHABR""? Not a word? 

So I think ""CHAIR"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""CHAIR"". 

<guess>chair</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
  - **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
  - **A** is correct and in position 3 (✓).  
  - **N** and **E** are absent (x).  

- **Guess 2 (""charm"")**:  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).  
  - **H** is correct and in position 2 (✓).  
  - **A** is correct and in position 3 (✓).  
  - **R** is in the word but not in position 4 (-).  
  - **M** is absent (x).  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: **C H A _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as C, H, A).  
2. **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (per feedback). The only remaining position is **5**, so the pattern is **C H A _ R**.  
3. The fourth letter is unknown but cannot be **C, H, A, R** (no duplicates indicated) and cannot be **N, E, M** (absent per feedback).  
4. Common words fitting this pattern:  
   - **CHAIR** (I in position 4) is the only common English word that matches all constraints.  
     - Validates all feedback:  
       - ""crane"": C(✓), R(-) [R is in position 5, not 2], A(✓), N(x), E(x).  
       - ""charm"": C(✓), H(✓), A(✓), R(-) [R is in position 5, not 4], M(x).  

Given this, **CHAIR** is the most likely solution. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the fourth letter further, but no other common words fit the constraints.",Guess 3: chair -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) A(✓) I(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
