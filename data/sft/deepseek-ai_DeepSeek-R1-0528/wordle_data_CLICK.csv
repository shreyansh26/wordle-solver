We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note the feedback symbols: 
   ✓ means correct letter in correct position.
   - means correct letter but wrong position.
   x means letter not in the word.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll wait for the feedback to adjust.

 We return the guess in the required format.

I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. With no prior feedback, I should choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information. A strategic starting word often uses frequent letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N) without repeating letters. 

""CRANE"" fits well:
- Contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Often used as a strong opener in word games because it tests multiple high-frequency letters

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E.

We need to make a second guess. Since the first letter is fixed as C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.

Constraints:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must not contain R, A, N, E.
- We have 5 letters to guess, all distinct? Not necessarily, but in this case, since we are avoiding R,A,N,E, and we know C is at the start, we must choose a word that starts with C and uses other letters.

We should choose a word that uses common letters that are not R,A,N,E to maximize information.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note that we have to form a valid 5-letter word).

Vowels: We have eliminated A and E, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels to be valid.

Given that the first letter is C, we can think of common words starting with C.

We also know that the word does not have R, A, N, E. So, for example, words like ""crane"" itself are out.

Let's think of words starting with C that avoid R,A,N,E.

Some possibilities:
- Using I: city, clipt, etc. But we need 5 letters.
- Using O: could, cloud, etc. but avoid E and A? ""could"" has O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid? But note: ""could"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D -> yes.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We should avoid using letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we only know C is in the first position and R,A,N,E are absent, we can try to cover other common letters.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

A good candidate might be ""cough"": C-O-U-G-H -> but H is not very common? Or ""crisp"" but R is out (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Let's list some words starting with C without R,A,N,E:

- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H) -> tests O, U, G, H
- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D) -> tests O, U, L, D
- ""chill"" (C, H, I, L, L) -> but has double L, which might not be ideal because we get less information from repeated letters. However, it's acceptable if we don't have better.
- ""civic"" (C, I, V, I, C) -> repeated C and I, not good for information.
- ""crown"" -> but has R and N -> invalid because R and N are out.
- ""climb"" (C, L, I, M, B) -> tests L, I, M, B
- ""s"" is common: ""crass"" -> but has R and A -> invalid.

Another idea: ""chomp"" (C, H, O, M, P) -> tests H, O, M, P.

But we might prefer to include a vowel. Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U.

Let me think of words: ""cloud"" (C, L, O, U, D) -> tests L, O, U, D.

""could"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""cushy"" (C, U, S, H, Y) -> tests U, S, H, Y.

But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""cynic"" (C, Y, N, I, C) -> but N is out, so invalid.

We must avoid N.

So, let's avoid any word with R,A,N,E.

I think ""could"" is a reasonable choice: it uses O, U, L, D, which are common.

But we can do better? ""cough"" uses G and H, which are less common.

Another word: ""comet"" -> but E is out, so invalid.

""cabin"" -> A and N are out.

""cable"" -> A and E are out.

""chose"" -> E is out.

""chime"" -> E is out.

""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P) -> tests H, U, M, P.

""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P) -> tests L, U, M, P.

""clamp"" -> A is out.

""crimp"" -> R is out.

""crisp"" -> R is out.

""crock"" -> R is out.

So, without R,A,N,E, we have:

- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D)
- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H)
- ""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P)
- ""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P)
- ""build"" is not starting with C.

We also have ""civic"" but repeated letters.

Another one: ""cyber"" -> E and R are out.

""cowls"" (C, O, W, L, S) -> tests O, W, L, S. This seems good because it tests W and S, which are common.

""cowls"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning the covering for a chimney.

Similarly, ""crowns"" is too long.

5-letter: ""cowls"" -> C, O, W, L, S.

This tests O, W, L, S. All distinct and new.

Alternatively, ""cowry"" (C, O, W, R, Y) -> but R is out, invalid.

""cowls"" is acceptable.

Another: ""combs"" (C, O, M, B, S) -> tests O, M, B, S.

Also good.

We can also consider ""colds"" (C, O, L, D, S) -> but we have O, L, D, S.

But note: we don't know if O is in the word, so we want to test multiple vowels? We have U and I as well.

But we have limited tries.

I think ""cowls"" or ""combs"" are good.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.

According to English letter frequency, after vowels (A,E are out), the next common are: S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.

So, including S and T might be good.

But we don't have T in ""cowls"" or ""combs"".

What about ""coils"" (C, O, I, L, S) -> tests O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid R,A,N,E, which we are.

""coils"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""cults"" (C, U, L, T, S) -> tests U, L, T, S.

This seems even better because it tests U and T, which are common.

And S and L are also common.

So, ""cults"": C, U, L, T, S.

All distinct, and we test U, L, T, S.

We know the first letter is C, so we are guessing the next four.

Alternatively, ""curbs"" -> but R is out.

""cunts"" -> not appropriate and has N.

""cushy"" -> has H and Y, which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""civvy"" -> repeated V and Y, not good.

Or ""cysts"" -> repeated S and Y.

So, I'll go with ""cults"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known C in the first position? Actually, we are: the first letter is fixed as C, so we must start with C.

So, our guess must start with C.

Therefore, I choose ""cults"".

But let me confirm: C U L T S.

We are testing U, L, T, S in positions 2,3,4,5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""costs"" -> repeated S and O, but we avoid repetition? We want distinct to test more.

""cults"" has distinct letters.

""comet"" is invalid because of E.

So, ""cults"" seems fine.

But is ""cults"" a valid word? Yes, meaning systems of religious worship.

Alternatively, ""cough"" is also valid, but it tests G and H which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is better.

We can also consider ""cowps"" but that might not be common.

I'll go with ""cults"".

So, the guess is ""cults"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, and E are absent from the word entirely.
- The word must be a 5-letter word starting with C, using only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, N, E).

For the second guess, I need to test new common letters to gather more information. I should prioritize:
- Letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, M, etc.).
- Avoiding repeated letters to maximize coverage.
- Common vowels like O, U, or I (since A and E are eliminated).

A strong candidate is ""cults"" because:
- It starts with C (leveraging the known first letter).
- It tests new common letters: U (vowel), L, T, and S (high-frequency consonants).
- All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.
- It avoids R, A, N, E as required.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note the feedback symbols: 
   ✓ means correct letter in correct position.
   - means correct letter but wrong position.
   x means letter not in the word.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll wait for the feedback to adjust.

 We return the guess in the required format.I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. With no prior feedback, I should choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information. A strategic starting word often uses frequent letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N) without repeating letters. 

""CRANE"" fits well:
- Contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Often used as a strong opener in word games because it tests multiple high-frequency letters

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E.

We need to make a second guess. Since the first letter is fixed as C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.

Constraints:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must not contain R, A, N, E.
- We have 5 letters to guess, all distinct? Not necessarily, but in this case, since we are avoiding R,A,N,E, and we know C is at the start, we must choose a word that starts with C and uses other letters.

We should choose a word that uses common letters that are not R,A,N,E to maximize information.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note that we have to form a valid 5-letter word).

Vowels: We have eliminated A and E, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels to be valid.

Given that the first letter is C, we can think of common words starting with C.

We also know that the word does not have R, A, N, E. So, for example, words like ""crane"" itself are out.

Let's think of words starting with C that avoid R,A,N,E.

Some possibilities:
- Using I: city, clipt, etc. But we need 5 letters.
- Using O: could, cloud, etc. but avoid E and A? ""could"" has O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid? But note: ""could"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D -> yes.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We should avoid using letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we only know C is in the first position and R,A,N,E are absent, we can try to cover other common letters.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

A good candidate might be ""cough"": C-O-U-G-H -> but H is not very common? Or ""crisp"" but R is out (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Let's list some words starting with C without R,A,N,E:

- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H) -> tests O, U, G, H
- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D) -> tests O, U, L, D
- ""chill"" (C, H, I, L, L) -> but has double L, which might not be ideal because we get less information from repeated letters. However, it's acceptable if we don't have better.
- ""civic"" (C, I, V, I, C) -> repeated C and I, not good for information.
- ""crown"" -> but has R and N -> invalid because R and N are out.
- ""climb"" (C, L, I, M, B) -> tests L, I, M, B
- ""s"" is common: ""crass"" -> but has R and A -> invalid.

Another idea: ""chomp"" (C, H, O, M, P) -> tests H, O, M, P.

But we might prefer to include a vowel. Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U.

Let me think of words: ""cloud"" (C, L, O, U, D) -> tests L, O, U, D.

""could"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""cushy"" (C, U, S, H, Y) -> tests U, S, H, Y.

But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""cynic"" (C, Y, N, I, C) -> but N is out, so invalid.

We must avoid N.

So, let's avoid any word with R,A,N,E.

I think ""could"" is a reasonable choice: it uses O, U, L, D, which are common.

But we can do better? ""cough"" uses G and H, which are less common.

Another word: ""comet"" -> but E is out, so invalid.

""cabin"" -> A and N are out.

""cable"" -> A and E are out.

""chose"" -> E is out.

""chime"" -> E is out.

""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P) -> tests H, U, M, P.

""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P) -> tests L, U, M, P.

""clamp"" -> A is out.

""crimp"" -> R is out.

""crisp"" -> R is out.

""crock"" -> R is out.

So, without R,A,N,E, we have:

- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D)
- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H)
- ""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P)
- ""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P)
- ""build"" is not starting with C.

We also have ""civic"" but repeated letters.

Another one: ""cyber"" -> E and R are out.

""cowls"" (C, O, W, L, S) -> tests O, W, L, S. This seems good because it tests W and S, which are common.

""cowls"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning the covering for a chimney.

Similarly, ""crowns"" is too long.

5-letter: ""cowls"" -> C, O, W, L, S.

This tests O, W, L, S. All distinct and new.

Alternatively, ""cowry"" (C, O, W, R, Y) -> but R is out, invalid.

""cowls"" is acceptable.

Another: ""combs"" (C, O, M, B, S) -> tests O, M, B, S.

Also good.

We can also consider ""colds"" (C, O, L, D, S) -> but we have O, L, D, S.

But note: we don't know if O is in the word, so we want to test multiple vowels? We have U and I as well.

But we have limited tries.

I think ""cowls"" or ""combs"" are good.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.

According to English letter frequency, after vowels (A,E are out), the next common are: S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.

So, including S and T might be good.

But we don't have T in ""cowls"" or ""combs"".

What about ""coils"" (C, O, I, L, S) -> tests O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid R,A,N,E, which we are.

""coils"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""cults"" (C, U, L, T, S) -> tests U, L, T, S.

This seems even better because it tests U and T, which are common.

And S and L are also common.

So, ""cults"": C, U, L, T, S.

All distinct, and we test U, L, T, S.

We know the first letter is C, so we are guessing the next four.

Alternatively, ""curbs"" -> but R is out.

""cunts"" -> not appropriate and has N.

""cushy"" -> has H and Y, which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""civvy"" -> repeated V and Y, not good.

Or ""cysts"" -> repeated S and Y.

So, I'll go with ""cults"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known C in the first position? Actually, we are: the first letter is fixed as C, so we must start with C.

So, our guess must start with C.

Therefore, I choose ""cults"".

But let me confirm: C U L T S.

We are testing U, L, T, S in positions 2,3,4,5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""costs"" -> repeated S and O, but we avoid repetition? We want distinct to test more.

""cults"" has distinct letters.

""comet"" is invalid because of E.

So, ""cults"" seems fine.

But is ""cults"" a valid word? Yes, meaning systems of religious worship.

Alternatively, ""cough"" is also valid, but it tests G and H which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is better.

We can also consider ""cowps"" but that might not be common.

I'll go with ""cults"".

So, the guess is ""cults"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, and E are absent from the word entirely.
- The word must be a 5-letter word starting with C, using only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, N, E).

For the second guess, I need to test new common letters to gather more information. I should prioritize:
- Letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, M, etc.).
- Avoiding repeated letters to maximize coverage.
- Common vowels like O, U, or I (since A and E are eliminated).

A strong candidate is ""cults"" because:
- It starts with C (leveraging the known first letter).
- It tests new common letters: U (vowel), L, T, and S (high-frequency consonants).
- All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.
- It avoids R, A, N, E as required.

This guess will help identify correct letters and their positions for the remaining four slots.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
So, we know:
- The first letter is C (correct position).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
So, interpreting:
- C is still in the first position (as expected).
- U is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since we placed L in the third position, but it's not there).
- T is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
1. The word starts with C.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the third position.
3. Letters absent: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

The only confirmed present letters are C (in position 1) and L (somewhere not in position 3).

We need to make a third guess.

Constraints:
- The word begins with C.
- Contains L (but not in position 3).
- Does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.
- We have to form a 5-letter word from the remaining letters.

Available letters: English alphabet minus known absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S. So excluded: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

Remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: C is already fixed in position 1, and L is present but position unknown.

However, L must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5 (since not in 3).

We should also test other common letters and try to place L correctly.

We have only one known present letter besides C: L.

Therefore, our next guess should:
- Start with C.
- Include L in a position other than 3 (so 2,4, or 5).
- Use letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, etc.

Let's think of words that fit: starting with C, include L, and avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- Position for L: Let's try putting L in position 2: then we have C L _ _ _
  Words: clomp, climb, clung (but U is absent), clink, claimed (too long), etc.

But absent letters include U, T, S, etc.

Options for C L _ _ _ : 
  - ""clomb"" (archaic past of climb) - but not common.
  - ""clamp"" - A is absent.
  - ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> all available letters? I, M, B are allowed. This seems good.

Check letters: C, L, I, M, B. None of I, M, B are excluded.

So ""climb"" is a candidate.

But note: We have L in position 2, which is a test.

- Another possibility: L in position 4: C _ _ L _
  Words: could (U absent), chill (H, I, L twice?).

Possible: ""cavil"" (C,A,V,I,L) but A is absent.

""civic"" - I,V,I,C - but V and I are allowed? But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).

""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let's see: C I V I C.

We know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but we don't know the secret word's letter repetition.

But in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.

However, it's messy.

Better to avoid repetition if possible.

So ""civic"" is not ideal.

Another word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.

""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.

We could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.

Similarly, ""croll"" - not a word.

""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.

So perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.

L in position 5: C _ _ _ L
Words: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.

""coral"" invalid.

""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.

""covyl"" - not common.

""cabal"" - A absent.

""cecal"" - E absent.

So few options with L at the end.

Alternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _
Words: ""babel"" not starting C.

""cavil"" - A absent.

""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. 

""comply"" too long.

""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.

""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.

So perhaps L at position 2 is easier.

Thus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.

It tests I, M, B in new positions.

We might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.

What about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.

Not ideal.

""colly"" - repeated L.

Another idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.

So ""climb"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.

""cymol"" not common.

But we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.

Position: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.

This avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.

So ""child"" is another candidate.

It tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.

Compared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.

Which one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.

But ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.

Both are reasonable.

We could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.

Also valid.

So options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".

Now, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).

In ""child"", we test I at position 3.

In ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.

But note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.

In ""climb"", position 3 is I.

In ""clomp"", position 3 is O.

We don't know which vowel might be present.

Another word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.

""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.

""chilk"" not word.

So back.

I think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.

Let's choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.

Remaining common: I, O, D, L (already known), H, M, B.

Actually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.

In ""child"" we test H, I, D.

In ""climb"" we test I, M, B.

Since D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.

H is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.

H and D are more common than M and B.

Moreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).

In ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn't tested before.

We tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.

Trying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.

In ""child"", we try position 4.

In ""climb"", position 2.

Both are new.

But ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.

So I'll pick ""child.""

But note: in ""child"", letter positions:
1:C (correct)
2:H
3:I
4:L
5:D

We are testing H, I, D.

If we get feedback, we can determine about L's position.

Another possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.

""chill"" has repeated L.

So ""child"" is better.

But let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""child"".

In my thinking, I am considering both, but I'll go with ""child"".
</think>
From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **L** is present, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.
4. The word may contain letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, prioritize:
- Including **L** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its placement.
- Covering common remaining letters like **I, O, H, D** to maximize information.
- Avoiding absent letters.

The word ""child"" fits perfectly:
- Starts with **C** (known position).
- Places **L** in position 4 (new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **H** (position 2), **I** (vowel in position 3), **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will help identify potential letters and positions for L and other characters.

<guess>child</guess>",child,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
So, we know:
- The first letter is C (correct position).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
So, interpreting:
- C is still in the first position (as expected).
- U is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since we placed L in the third position, but it's not there).
- T is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
1. The word starts with C.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the third position.
3. Letters absent: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

The only confirmed present letters are C (in position 1) and L (somewhere not in position 3).

We need to make a third guess.

Constraints:
- The word begins with C.
- Contains L (but not in position 3).
- Does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.
- We have to form a 5-letter word from the remaining letters.

Available letters: English alphabet minus known absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S. So excluded: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

Remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: C is already fixed in position 1, and L is present but position unknown.

However, L must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5 (since not in 3).

We should also test other common letters and try to place L correctly.

We have only one known present letter besides C: L.

Therefore, our next guess should:
- Start with C.
- Include L in a position other than 3 (so 2,4, or 5).
- Use letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, etc.

Let's think of words that fit: starting with C, include L, and avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- Position for L: Let's try putting L in position 2: then we have C L _ _ _
  Words: clomp, climb, clung (but U is absent), clink, claimed (too long), etc.

But absent letters include U, T, S, etc.

Options for C L _ _ _ : 
  - ""clomb"" (archaic past of climb) - but not common.
  - ""clamp"" - A is absent.
  - ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> all available letters? I, M, B are allowed. This seems good.

Check letters: C, L, I, M, B. None of I, M, B are excluded.

So ""climb"" is a candidate.

But note: We have L in position 2, which is a test.

- Another possibility: L in position 4: C _ _ L _
  Words: could (U absent), chill (H, I, L twice?).

Possible: ""cavil"" (C,A,V,I,L) but A is absent.

""civic"" - I,V,I,C - but V and I are allowed? But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).

""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let's see: C I V I C.

We know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but we don't know the secret word's letter repetition.

But in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.

However, it's messy.

Better to avoid repetition if possible.

So ""civic"" is not ideal.

Another word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.

""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.

We could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.

Similarly, ""croll"" - not a word.

""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.

So perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.

L in position 5: C _ _ _ L
Words: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.

""coral"" invalid.

""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.

""covyl"" - not common.

""cabal"" - A absent.

""cecal"" - E absent.

So few options with L at the end.

Alternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _
Words: ""babel"" not starting C.

""cavil"" - A absent.

""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. 

""comply"" too long.

""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.

""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.

So perhaps L at position 2 is easier.

Thus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.

It tests I, M, B in new positions.

We might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.

What about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.

Not ideal.

""colly"" - repeated L.

Another idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.

So ""climb"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.

""cymol"" not common.

But we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.

Position: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.

This avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.

So ""child"" is another candidate.

It tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.

Compared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.

Which one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.

But ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.

Both are reasonable.

We could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.

Also valid.

So options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".

Now, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).

In ""child"", we test I at position 3.

In ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.

But note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.

In ""climb"", position 3 is I.

In ""clomp"", position 3 is O.

We don't know which vowel might be present.

Another word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.

""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.

""chilk"" not word.

So back.

I think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.

Let's choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.

Actually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.

In ""child"" we test H, I, D.

In ""climb"" we test I, M, B.

Since D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.

H is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.

H and D are more common than M and B.

Moreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).

In ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn't tested before.

We tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.

Trying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.

In ""child"", we try position 4.

In ""climb"", position 2.

Both are new.

But ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.

So I'll pick ""child.""

But note: in ""child"", letter positions:
1:C (correct)
2:H
3:I
4:L
5:D

We are testing H, I, D.

If we get feedback, we can determine about L's position.

Another possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.

""chill"" has repeated L.

So ""child"" is better.

But let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""child"".

In my thinking, I am considering both, but I'll go with ""child"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.

3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note the feedback symbols: 
   ✓ means correct letter in correct position.
   - means correct letter but wrong position.
   x means letter not in the word.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll wait for the feedback to adjust.

 We return the guess in the required format.I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. With no prior feedback, I should choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information. A strategic starting word often uses frequent letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N) without repeating letters. 

""CRANE"" fits well:
- Contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Often used as a strong opener in word games because it tests multiple high-frequency letters

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E.

We need to make a second guess. Since the first letter is fixed as C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.

Constraints:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must not contain R, A, N, E.
- We have 5 letters to guess, all distinct? Not necessarily, but in this case, since we are avoiding R,A,N,E, and we know C is at the start, we must choose a word that starts with C and uses other letters.

We should choose a word that uses common letters that are not R,A,N,E to maximize information.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note that we have to form a valid 5-letter word).

Vowels: We have eliminated A and E, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels to be valid.

Given that the first letter is C, we can think of common words starting with C.

We also know that the word does not have R, A, N, E. So, for example, words like ""crane"" itself are out.

Let's think of words starting with C that avoid R,A,N,E.

Some possibilities:
- Using I: city, clipt, etc. But we need 5 letters.
- Using O: could, cloud, etc. but avoid E and A? ""could"" has O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid? But note: ""could"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D -> yes.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We should avoid using letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we only know C is in the first position and R,A,N,E are absent, we can try to cover other common letters.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

A good candidate might be ""cough"": C-O-U-G-H -> but H is not very common? Or ""crisp"" but R is out (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Let's list some words starting with C without R,A,N,E:

- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H) -> tests O, U, G, H
- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D) -> tests O, U, L, D
- ""chill"" (C, H, I, L, L) -> but has double L, which might not be ideal because we get less information from repeated letters. However, it's acceptable if we don't have better.
- ""civic"" (C, I, V, I, C) -> repeated C and I, not good for information.
- ""crown"" -> but has R and N -> invalid because R and N are out.
- ""climb"" (C, L, I, M, B) -> tests L, I, M, B
- ""s"" is common: ""crass"" -> but has R and A -> invalid.

Another idea: ""chomp"" (C, H, O, M, P) -> tests H, O, M, P.

But we might prefer to include a vowel. Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U.

Let me think of words: ""cloud"" (C, L, O, U, D) -> tests L, O, U, D.

""could"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""cushy"" (C, U, S, H, Y) -> tests U, S, H, Y.

But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""cynic"" (C, Y, N, I, C) -> but N is out, so invalid.

We must avoid N.

So, let's avoid any word with R,A,N,E.

I think ""could"" is a reasonable choice: it uses O, U, L, D, which are common.

But we can do better? ""cough"" uses G and H, which are less common.

Another word: ""comet"" -> but E is out, so invalid.

""cabin"" -> A and N are out.

""cable"" -> A and E are out.

""chose"" -> E is out.

""chime"" -> E is out.

""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P) -> tests H, U, M, P.

""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P) -> tests L, U, M, P.

""clamp"" -> A is out.

""crimp"" -> R is out.

""crisp"" -> R is out.

""crock"" -> R is out.

So, without R,A,N,E, we have:

- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D)
- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H)
- ""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P)
- ""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P)
- ""build"" is not starting with C.

We also have ""civic"" but repeated letters.

Another one: ""cyber"" -> E and R are out.

""cowls"" (C, O, W, L, S) -> tests O, W, L, S. This seems good because it tests W and S, which are common.

""cowls"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning the covering for a chimney.

Similarly, ""crowns"" is too long.

5-letter: ""cowls"" -> C, O, W, L, S.

This tests O, W, L, S. All distinct and new.

Alternatively, ""cowry"" (C, O, W, R, Y) -> but R is out, invalid.

""cowls"" is acceptable.

Another: ""combs"" (C, O, M, B, S) -> tests O, M, B, S.

Also good.

We can also consider ""colds"" (C, O, L, D, S) -> but we have O, L, D, S.

But note: we don't know if O is in the word, so we want to test multiple vowels? We have U and I as well.

But we have limited tries.

I think ""cowls"" or ""combs"" are good.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.

According to English letter frequency, after vowels (A,E are out), the next common are: S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.

So, including S and T might be good.

But we don't have T in ""cowls"" or ""combs"".

What about ""coils"" (C, O, I, L, S) -> tests O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid R,A,N,E, which we are.

""coils"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""cults"" (C, U, L, T, S) -> tests U, L, T, S.

This seems even better because it tests U and T, which are common.

And S and L are also common.

So, ""cults"": C, U, L, T, S.

All distinct, and we test U, L, T, S.

We know the first letter is C, so we are guessing the next four.

Alternatively, ""curbs"" -> but R is out.

""cunts"" -> not appropriate and has N.

""cushy"" -> has H and Y, which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""civvy"" -> repeated V and Y, not good.

Or ""cysts"" -> repeated S and Y.

So, I'll go with ""cults"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known C in the first position? Actually, we are: the first letter is fixed as C, so we must start with C.

So, our guess must start with C.

Therefore, I choose ""cults"".

But let me confirm: C U L T S.

We are testing U, L, T, S in positions 2,3,4,5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""costs"" -> repeated S and O, but we avoid repetition? We want distinct to test more.

""cults"" has distinct letters.

""comet"" is invalid because of E.

So, ""cults"" seems fine.

But is ""cults"" a valid word? Yes, meaning systems of religious worship.

Alternatively, ""cough"" is also valid, but it tests G and H which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is better.

We can also consider ""cowps"" but that might not be common.

I'll go with ""cults"".

So, the guess is ""cults"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, and E are absent from the word entirely.
- The word must be a 5-letter word starting with C, using only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, N, E).

For the second guess, I need to test new common letters to gather more information. I should prioritize:
- Letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, M, etc.).
- Avoiding repeated letters to maximize coverage.
- Common vowels like O, U, or I (since A and E are eliminated).

A strong candidate is ""cults"" because:
- It starts with C (leveraging the known first letter).
- It tests new common letters: U (vowel), L, T, and S (high-frequency consonants).
- All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.
- It avoids R, A, N, E as required.

This guess will help identify correct letters and their positions for the remaining four slots.

<guess>cults</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
So, we know:
- The first letter is C (correct position).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
So, interpreting:
- C is still in the first position (as expected).
- U is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since we placed L in the third position, but it's not there).
- T is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
1. The word starts with C.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the third position.
3. Letters absent: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

The only confirmed present letters are C (in position 1) and L (somewhere not in position 3).

We need to make a third guess.

Constraints:
- The word begins with C.
- Contains L (but not in position 3).
- Does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.
- We have to form a 5-letter word from the remaining letters.

Available letters: English alphabet minus known absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S. So excluded: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

Remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: C is already fixed in position 1, and L is present but position unknown.

However, L must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5 (since not in 3).

We should also test other common letters and try to place L correctly.

We have only one known present letter besides C: L.

Therefore, our next guess should:
- Start with C.
- Include L in a position other than 3 (so 2,4, or 5).
- Use letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, etc.

Let's think of words that fit: starting with C, include L, and avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- Position for L: Let's try putting L in position 2: then we have C L _ _ _
  Words: clomp, climb, clung (but U is absent), clink, claimed (too long), etc.

But absent letters include U, T, S, etc.

Options for C L _ _ _ : 
  - ""clomb"" (archaic past of climb) - but not common.
  - ""clamp"" - A is absent.
  - ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> all available letters? I, M, B are allowed. This seems good.

Check letters: C, L, I, M, B. None of I, M, B are excluded.

So ""climb"" is a candidate.

But note: We have L in position 2, which is a test.

- Another possibility: L in position 4: C _ _ L _
  Words: could (U absent), chill (H, I, L twice?).

Possible: ""cavil"" (C,A,V,I,L) but A is absent.

""civic"" - I,V,I,C - but V and I are allowed? But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).

""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let's see: C I V I C.

We know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but we don't know the secret word's letter repetition.

But in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.

However, it's messy.

Better to avoid repetition if possible.

So ""civic"" is not ideal.

Another word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.

""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.

We could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.

Similarly, ""croll"" - not a word.

""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.

So perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.

L in position 5: C _ _ _ L
Words: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.

""coral"" invalid.

""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.

""covyl"" - not common.

""cabal"" - A absent.

""cecal"" - E absent.

So few options with L at the end.

Alternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _
Words: ""babel"" not starting C.

""cavil"" - A absent.

""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. 

""comply"" too long.

""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.

""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.

So perhaps L at position 2 is easier.

Thus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.

It tests I, M, B in new positions.

We might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.

What about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.

Not ideal.

""colly"" - repeated L.

Another idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.

So ""climb"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.

""cymol"" not common.

But we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.

Position: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.

This avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.

So ""child"" is another candidate.

It tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.

Compared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.

Which one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.

But ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.

Both are reasonable.

We could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.

Also valid.

So options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".

Now, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).

In ""child"", we test I at position 3.

In ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.

But note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.

In ""climb"", position 3 is I.

In ""clomp"", position 3 is O.

We don't know which vowel might be present.

Another word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.

""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.

""chilk"" not word.

So back.

I think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.

Let's choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.

Remaining common: I, O, D, L (already known), H, M, B.

Actually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.

In ""child"" we test H, I, D.

In ""climb"" we test I, M, B.

Since D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.

H is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.

H and D are more common than M and B.

Moreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).

In ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn't tested before.

We tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.

Trying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.

In ""child"", we try position 4.

In ""climb"", position 2.

Both are new.

But ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.

So I'll pick ""child.""

But note: in ""child"", letter positions:
1:C (correct)
2:H
3:I
4:L
5:D

We are testing H, I, D.

If we get feedback, we can determine about L's position.

Another possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.

""chill"" has repeated L.

So ""child"" is better.

But let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""child"".

In my thinking, I am considering both, but I'll go with ""child"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **L** is present, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.
4. The word may contain letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, prioritize:
- Including **L** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its placement.
- Covering common remaining letters like **I, O, H, D** to maximize information.
- Avoiding absent letters.

The word ""child"" fits perfectly:
- Starts with **C** (known position).
- Places **L** in position 4 (new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **H** (position 2), **I** (vowel in position 3), **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will help identify potential letters and positions for L and other characters.

But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).\n\n""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let\'s see: C I V I C.\n\nWe know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don\'t prohibit it, but we don\'t know the secret word\'s letter repetition.\n\nBut in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.\n\nHowever, it\'s messy.\n\nBetter to avoid repetition if possible.\n\nSo ""civic"" is not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.\n\n""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.\n\nWe could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.\n\nSimilarly, ""croll"" - not a word.\n\n""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.\n\nSo perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.\n\nL in position 5: C _ _ _ L\nWords: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.\n\n""coral"" invalid.\n\n""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.\n\n""covyl"" - not common.\n\n""cabal"" - A absent.\n\n""cecal"" - E absent.\n\nSo few options with L at the end.\n\nAlternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _\nWords: ""babel"" not starting C.\n\n""cavil"" - A absent.\n\n""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. \n\n""comply"" too long.\n\n""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.\n\n""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.\n\nSo perhaps L at position 2 is easier.\n\nThus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.\n\nIt tests I, M, B in new positions.\n\nWe might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.\n\nWhat about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""colly"" - repeated L.\n\nAnother idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.\n\nSo ""climb"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.\n\n""cymol"" not common.\n\nBut we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.\n\nPosition: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.\n\nThis avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.\n\nSo ""child"" is another candidate.\n\nIt tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.\n\nCompared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.\n\nWhich one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.\n\nBut ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.\n\nBoth are reasonable.\n\nWe could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nSo options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".\n\nNow, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).\n\nIn ""child"", we test I at position 3.\n\nIn ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.\n\nIn ""climb"", position 3 is I.\n\nIn ""clomp"", position 3 is O.\n\nWe don\'t know which vowel might be present.\n\nAnother word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.\n\n""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.\n\n""chilk"" not word.\n\nSo back.\n\nI think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.\n\nLet\'s choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.\n\nRemaining common: I, O, D, L (already known), H, M, B.\n\nActually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.\n\nIn ""child"" we test H, I, D.\n\nIn ""climb"" we test I, M, B.\n\nSince D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.\n\nH is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.\n\nH and D are more common than M and B.\n\nMoreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).\n\nIn ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn\'t tested before.\n\nWe tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.\n\nTrying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.\n\nIn ""child"", we try position 4.\n\nIn ""climb"", position 2.\n\nBoth are new.\n\nBut ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.\n\nSo I\'ll pick ""child.""\n\nBut note: in ""child"", letter positions:\n1:C (correct)\n2:H\n3:I\n4:L\n5:D\n\nWe are testing H, I, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can determine about L\'s position.\n\nAnother possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.\n\n""chill"" has repeated L.\n\nSo ""child"" is better.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""child"".\n\nIn my thinking, I am considering both, but I\'ll go with ""child"".From the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.\n- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **L** is present, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).\n3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.\n4. The word may contain letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the third guess, prioritize:\n- Including **L** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its placement.\n- Covering common remaining letters like **I, O, H, D** to maximize information.\n- Avoiding absent letters.\n\nThe word ""child"" fits perfectly:\n- Starts with **C** (known position).\n- Places **L** in position 4 (new position to test).\n- Tests new common letters: **H** (position 2), **I** (vowel in position 3), **D** (position 5).\n- All letters are distinct and valid.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify potential letters and positions for L and other characters.\n\n<guess>child</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - U is absent.
  - L is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - T and S are absent.

Guess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - H is absent.
  - I is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is I).
  - L is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - D is absent.

Now, we know:
- The word starts with C and has I in the third position: so the pattern is C _ I _ _
- L is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess2) and not in position 4 (from guess3). Therefore, L must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So the word is of the form: C [not L? but L could be here] I _ _ 
But note: L must be in position 2 or 5. However, in position 2 we haven't tested L yet? In guess2, L was in position 3, and in guess3, L was in position 4. So position 2 is still possible.

Actually, we have not placed L in position 2 or 5 yet. So L must be in either position 2 or 5.

Also, we know the third letter is I.

So the word is: C [position2] I [position4] [position5]

And L is either in position2 or position5.

Now, the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and L, but L is already known to be present, so we don't need to test for presence, only position).

But note: we have to fill position2, position4, and position5, with one of them being L (either pos2 or pos5) and the other two from the available letters.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We have two main cases: L in position2 or L in position5.

Case 1: L in position2 -> word: C L I _ _
Case 2: L in position5 -> word: C _ I _ L

We should design a guess that can help distinguish these cases and also test other letters.

But note: we have only two possibilities for L, so we can try to fix L in one of the positions and test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position5 (to test that case) and uses other new letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we could put L in position2.

But we also need to test the remaining positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Available letters (excluding absent ones and including L): B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and L.

But L is already known, so we are focusing on the positions.

Let's list possible words for each case to see what is feasible.

First, if L is in position2: C L I _ _
We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters from available set, avoiding absent letters.

Possible words:
- C L I M B -> ""climb"" (but we already guessed ""climb""? No, we guessed ""child"", not ""climb"". In guess3 we did ""child"", not ""climb"".)
  But ""climb"" has M and B, which are available.
- C L I P P -> ""clipp"" not a word.
- C L I P E -> E absent.
- C L I N G -> N absent.
- C L I V E -> E absent.
- C L I C K -> C repeated? But we have C at start, and then C at the end? The word ""click"" is C L I C K. But we know the first letter is C, and if the word has another C, that's possible. But we haven't tested for duplicate C. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible.

But in ""click"", we have C at position 1 and 4? C L I C K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we have a C at position 4. Is that allowed? The feedback for the first guess had C only at position 1, and we haven't seen C elsewhere. But in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, in other guesses, we only had C at position 1.

So it's possible that C appears again? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had C as correct and the others absent, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C because we only had one C in ""crane"". Similarly for the other guesses.

So duplicate C is possible.

But let's see: if we have C at position 4, then the word would be ""click"". But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not in the absent list, so yes.

Similarly, ""cliff"" (C L I F F) -> F is available, but repeated F? And we don't know if F is present.

But let's list possible words for case 1 (L in pos2):

- ""click"": C, L, I, C, K -> but we have two C's. We test K at position 5.
- ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> M and B.
- ""clink"": but N is absent.
- ""clipt"": not common, and T absent? T is absent, so no.
- ""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> repeated F.
- ""clomp"": C, L, O, M, P -> but position 3 is O? No, we have fixed I at position 3. So for case1, position3 is I, so we need C L I _ _.

So words: 
- ""click"" (C,L,I,C,K)
- ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B)
- ""clipt"" invalid (T absent)
- ""cliff"" (C,L,I,F,F) - repeated F
- ""clink"" invalid (N absent)
- ""clyde"" (C,L,Y,D,E) - D and E absent, invalid.

So only a few: ""click"", ""climb"", and perhaps ""cliff"" (if we accept repeated F).

Now, for case 2: L in position5: C _ I _ L

We need to fill position2 and position4.

Possible words:
- C O I N L -> N absent, invalid.
- C O I L ? but we need 5 letters: C _ I _ L, so two letters to fill: position2 and position4.

Examples:
- C H I L L -> repeated L, and H absent? H is absent from guess3.
- C R I M L -> R absent.
- C A I L ? A absent.

Available: so position2 and position4 must be from B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words:
- ""coil"" is 4 letters, we need 5: C O I L ? -> but we have C _ I _ L, so for example:
  - ""cavil"" -> A absent.
  - ""civil"" -> C,I,V,I,L -> repeated I? C, V, I, L. But we have position2: V, position4: I? But we know position3 is I, so if we put I at position4, that would be repeated I. But the word ""civil"" is C I V I L? No, ""civil"" is C-I-V-I-L, so positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L. But we know position3 must be I, so in ""civil"", position3 is V, which is not I. So invalid for our pattern.

We need position3 to be I, so the word must be C [pos2] I [pos4] L (with L at pos5).

So: C ? I ? L

Examples:
- ""boil"" is 4 letters.
- ""broil"" has R, absent.
- ""choil"" not a word.
- ""coign"" -> C,O,I,G,N -> N absent, and not ending with L.
- ""coyly"" -> C,O,Y,L,Y -> but L is at position4? C O Y L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we need position3 to be I, not Y. So invalid.

We need position3 to be I.

So: C [letter] I [letter] L

Possible words:
- ""civil"": but that's C I V I L -> position2 is I, position3 is V, position4 is I. But we need position3 to be I, so it doesn't match.

Perhaps ""civic"" but ends with C, not L.

Another: ""twirl"" not starting with C.

I think there are very few words that fit C ? I ? L.

For example, ""chill"" is C H I L L -> but L at position4 and 5? And we have position3: I. So ""chill"" is C H I L L.

But H is absent (from guess3), so invalid.

""cill"" is 4 letters.

""krill"" not starting with C.

""quill"" not starting with C.

""shill"" has S and H, both absent.

""skill"" has S, absent.

""spill"" has S, absent.

""still"" has S and T, absent.

""swill"" has S, absent.

""thill"" has H and T, absent.

""trill"" has T and R, absent.

""villa"" not starting with C.

So, perhaps there are no common words of the form C ? I ? L with the available letters.

Let me check: available letters for position2 and position4: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- C O I L ? -> but we need two letters: C O I ? L? No, the pattern is C [2] I [4] L, so [2] and [4] must be filled.

For example, C O I L ? -> no, that would be 4 letters.

We need 5 letters: 1:C, 2:?, 3:I, 4:?, 5:L.

So, for example:
- C O I L L -> ""coill"" not a word.
- C O I P L -> ""coipl"" not a word.
- C B I L L -> ""cbill"" not a word.
- C F I L L -> ""cfill"" not a word.
- C K I L L -> ""ckill"" not a word, but ""skill"" is a word but not with C.

I think ""cavil"" is the only one I can think of, but A is absent.

Perhaps ""anvil"" not C.

Another: ""devil"" not C.

So it seems that having L at position5 might not be possible because we cannot form a valid word.

Therefore, it is more likely that L is in position2.

So the word is C L I _ _

And we need to fill positions 4 and 5.

From earlier, possible words: ""click"", ""climb"", ""cliff"", etc.

Now, in our third guess, we tried ""child"" which had H and D, which are absent, and L in position4 which was wrong.

For the fourth guess, we can try one of these.

But we need to test new letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""click"": which has C (position1), L (position2), I (position3), C (position4), K (position5).

But if we use ""click"", we are putting C at position4. If the word has a C there, we get feedback, but if not, we learn.

Similarly, we test K.

But we might not want to repeat C if unnecessary.

Alternatively, ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> tests M and B.

""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> tests F, but repeated.

Another word: ""clink"" invalid.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clomp"" has O, M, P but position3 is O? No, we have I at position3.

So only a few options.

We can also consider ""clyde"" but D and E absent.

So I think ""click"" or ""climb"" are the main options.

Let's choose ""click"" because it tests K and also the possibility of a second C.

But note: if the word has a second C, we would have seen it in feedback? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed C in any other position before.

In guess1, we had C only at position1.

In guess2, C at position1.

In guess3, C at position1.

So we don't know about other C's.

So ""click"" is a valid guess.

But let's see if there are other words without repeating C.

For example, ""climb"" doesn't repeat.

""cliff"" repeats F.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clink"" invalid.

""clock"" has O, C, K -> but C at position4? C L O C K? But position3 must be I, not O. So invalid.

""crock"" has R and O, R absent.

So ""climb"" seems a safe choice: C L I M B.

It tests M and B, both new letters.

We can also consider ""clomp"" but position3 is O, not I.

No.

Another: ""clasp"" has A and S, absent.

So I think ""climb"" is good.

But we already thought of ""climb"" earlier.

Perhaps ""cling"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""climb"".

But note: in ""climb"", we are putting L in position2. If L is actually in position5, then this guess will be wrong, but we think position5 is unlikely because we couldn't find words.

Moreover, if we get feedback that L is not in position2, then we know it must be in position5, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""climb"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""click"", then we would have:
- C: ✓ (position1)
- L: ✓ (position2) if L is in position2, or - if not? But we are putting L in position2, so if L is in position2, it will be ✓, else if L is in position5, it will be - (since L is present but not in position2).

Similarly for other letters.

But we are hoping to get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has L in position5 to test that case, but we couldn't find a valid word.

So ""climb"" is a reasonable choice.

Another word: ""civic"" but that has I at position2 and position4, and position3 is V, not I.

No.

So I think ""climb"" is the best.

Thus, we guess ""climb"".Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: pattern **C _ I _ _**.
- **L** is present but not in position 3 or 4, so it must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: **B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

Given the constraints, the most plausible pattern is **C L I _ _** (L in position 2) because:
- No common words fit **C _ I _ L** (L in position 5) using the remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" is invalid due to H, and other options like ""civil"" conflict with the fixed I in position 3).

For the fourth guess, test **C L I M B** (""climb""):
- Places **L** in position 2 to verify its placement.
- Tests new common letters **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will confirm if L is in position 2 and provide information on the remaining positions.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  
     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  
     → **L** is present but not in position 3. U, T, S are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  
     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4. H and D are absent.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The secret word pattern is **C _ I _ _** (positions: 1=C, 3=I).
   - **L must be in position 2 or 5** (since it's present but not in position 3 or 4).
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D (9 letters eliminated).
   - **Possible letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (13 letters left, including L for positions 2 or 5).

3. **Evaluate Word Possibilities**:
   - **If L is in position 2**: Pattern is **C L I _ _**.
     - Possible words: e.g., ""click"" (tests C at position 4, K at 5), ""climb"" (tests M at 4, B at 5), or ""cliff"" (tests F at 4 and 5, but repeated letters reduce information).
   - **If L is in position 5**: Pattern is **C _ I _ L**.
     - No valid words found using remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" invalid due to H; ""civil"" conflicts with I in position 3; other options like ""broil"" or ""skill"" contain absent letters).  
     → **L in position 2 is more likely** due to lack of valid alternatives for position 5.

4. **Select Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Test **L in position 2** while covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.
   - **""climb""** is chosen because:
     - Fits the pattern **C L I _ _** (L in position 2).
     - Tests **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5), both common untested letters.
     - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct letters for better feedback.
     - If L is not in position 2 (unlikely), feedback will confirm L must be in position 5, narrowing future guesses.

<guess>climb</guess>",climb,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - U is absent.
  - L is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - T and S are absent.

Guess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - H is absent.
  - I is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is I).
  - L is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - D is absent.

Now, we know:
- The word starts with C and has I in the third position: so the pattern is C _ I _ _
- L is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess2) and not in position 4 (from guess3). Therefore, L must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So the word is of the form: C [not L? but L could be here] I _ _ 
But note: L must be in position 2 or 5. However, in position 2 we haven't tested L yet? In guess2, L was in position 3, and in guess3, L was in position 4. So position 2 is still possible.

Actually, we have not placed L in position 2 or 5 yet. So L must be in either position 2 or 5.

Also, we know the third letter is I.

So the word is: C [position2] I [position4] [position5]

And L is either in position2 or position5.

Now, the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and L, but L is already known to be present, so we don't need to test for presence, only position).

But note: we have to fill position2, position4, and position5, with one of them being L (either pos2 or pos5) and the other two from the available letters.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We have two main cases: L in position2 or L in position5.

Case 1: L in position2 -> word: C L I _ _
Case 2: L in position5 -> word: C _ I _ L

We should design a guess that can help distinguish these cases and also test other letters.

But note: we have only two possibilities for L, so we can try to fix L in one of the positions and test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position5 (to test that case) and uses other new letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we could put L in position2.

But we also need to test the remaining positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Available letters (excluding absent ones and including L): B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and L.

But L is already known, so we are focusing on the positions.

Let's list possible words for each case to see what is feasible.

First, if L is in position2: C L I _ _
We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters from available set, avoiding absent letters.

Possible words:
- C L I M B -> ""climb"" (but we already guessed ""climb""? No, we guessed ""child"", not ""climb"". In guess3 we did ""child"", not ""climb"".)
  But ""climb"" has M and B, which are available.
- C L I P P -> ""clipp"" not a word.
- C L I P E -> E absent.
- C L I N G -> N absent.
- C L I V E -> E absent.
- C L I C K -> C repeated? But we have C at start, and then C at the end? The word ""click"" is C L I C K. But we know the first letter is C, and if the word has another C, that's possible. But we haven't tested for duplicate C. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible.

But in ""click"", we have C at position 1 and 4? C L I C K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we have a C at position 4. Is that allowed? The feedback for the first guess had C only at position 1, and we haven't seen C elsewhere. But in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, in other guesses, we only had C at position 1.

So it's possible that C appears again? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had C as correct and the others absent, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C because we only had one C in ""crane"". Similarly for the other guesses.

So duplicate C is possible.

But let's see: if we have C at position 4, then the word would be ""click"". But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not in the absent list, so yes.

Similarly, ""cliff"" (C L I F F) -> F is available, but repeated F? And we don't know if F is present.

But let's list possible words for case 1 (L in pos2):

- ""click"": C, L, I, C, K -> but we have two C's. We test K at position 5.
- ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> M and B.
- ""clink"": but N is absent.
- ""clipt"": not common, and T absent? T is absent, so no.
- ""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> repeated F.
- ""clomp"": C, L, O, M, P -> but position 3 is O? No, we have fixed I at position 3. So for case1, position3 is I, so we need C L I _ _.

So words: 
- ""click"" (C,L,I,C,K)
- ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B)
- ""clipt"" invalid (T absent)
- ""cliff"" (C,L,I,F,F) - repeated F
- ""clink"" invalid (N absent)
- ""clyde"" (C,L,Y,D,E) - D and E absent, invalid.

So only a few: ""click"", ""climb"", and perhaps ""cliff"" (if we accept repeated F).

Now, for case 2: L in position5: C _ I _ L

We need to fill position2 and position4.

Possible words:
- C O I N L -> N absent, invalid.
- C O I L ? but we need 5 letters: C _ I _ L, so two letters to fill: position2 and position4.

Examples:
- C H I L L -> repeated L, and H absent? H is absent from guess3.
- C R I M L -> R absent.
- C A I L ? A absent.

Available: so position2 and position4 must be from B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words:
- ""coil"" is 4 letters, we need 5: C O I L ? -> but we have C _ I _ L, so for example:
  - ""cavil"" -> A absent.
  - ""civil"" -> C,I,V,I,L -> repeated I? C, V, I, L. But we have position2: V, position4: I? But we know position3 is I, so if we put I at position4, that would be repeated I. But the word ""civil"" is C I V I L? No, ""civil"" is C-I-V-I-L, so positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L. But we know position3 must be I, so in ""civil"", position3 is V, which is not I. So invalid for our pattern.

We need position3 to be I, so the word must be C [pos2] I [pos4] L (with L at pos5).

So: C ? I ? L

Examples:
- ""boil"" is 4 letters.
- ""broil"" has R, absent.
- ""choil"" not a word.
- ""coign"" -> C,O,I,G,N -> N absent, and not ending with L.
- ""coyly"" -> C,O,Y,L,Y -> but L is at position4? C O Y L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we need position3 to be I, not Y. So invalid.

We need position3 to be I.

So: C [letter] I [letter] L

Possible words:
- ""civil"": but that's C I V I L -> position2 is I, position3 is V, position4 is I. But we need position3 to be I, so it doesn't match.

Perhaps ""civic"" but ends with C, not L.

Another: ""twirl"" not starting with C.

I think there are very few words that fit C ? I ? L.

For example, ""chill"" is C H I L L -> but L at position4 and 5? And we have position3: I. So ""chill"" is C H I L L.

But H is absent (from guess3), so invalid.

""cill"" is 4 letters.

""krill"" not starting with C.

""quill"" not starting with C.

""shill"" has S and H, both absent.

""skill"" has S, absent.

""spill"" has S, absent.

""still"" has S and T, absent.

""swill"" has S, absent.

""thill"" has H and T, absent.

""trill"" has T and R, absent.

""villa"" not starting with C.

So, perhaps there are no common words of the form C ? I ? L with the available letters.

Let me check: available letters for position2 and position4: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- C O I L ? -> but we need two letters: C O I ? L? No, the pattern is C [2] I [4] L, so [2] and [4] must be filled.

For example, C O I L ? -> no, that would be 4 letters.

We need 5 letters: 1:C, 2:?, 3:I, 4:?, 5:L.

So, for example:
- C O I L L -> ""coill"" not a word.
- C O I P L -> ""coipl"" not a word.
- C B I L L -> ""cbill"" not a word.
- C F I L L -> ""cfill"" not a word.
- C K I L L -> ""ckill"" not a word, but ""skill"" is a word but not with C.

I think ""cavil"" is the only one I can think of, but A is absent.

Perhaps ""anvil"" not C.

Another: ""devil"" not C.

So it seems that having L at position5 might not be possible because we cannot form a valid word.

Therefore, it is more likely that L is in position2.

So the word is C L I _ _

And we need to fill positions 4 and 5.

From earlier, possible words: ""click"", ""climb"", ""cliff"", etc.

Now, in our third guess, we tried ""child"" which had H and D, which are absent, and L in position4 which was wrong.

For the fourth guess, we can try one of these.

But we need to test new letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""click"": which has C (position1), L (position2), I (position3), C (position4), K (position5).

But if we use ""click"", we are putting C at position4. If the word has a C there, we get feedback, but if not, we learn.

Similarly, we test K.

But we might not want to repeat C if unnecessary.

Alternatively, ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> tests M and B.

""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> tests F, but repeated.

Another word: ""clink"" invalid.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clomp"" has O, M, P but position3 is O? No, we have I at position3.

So only a few options.

We can also consider ""clyde"" but D and E absent.

So I think ""click"" or ""climb"" are the main options.

Let's choose ""click"" because it tests K and also the possibility of a second C.

But note: if the word has a second C, we would have seen it in feedback? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed C in any other position before.

In guess1, we had C only at position1.

In guess2, C at position1.

In guess3, C at position1.

So we don't know about other C's.

So ""click"" is a valid guess.

But let's see if there are other words without repeating C.

For example, ""climb"" doesn't repeat.

""cliff"" repeats F.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clink"" invalid.

""clock"" has O, C, K -> but C at position4? C L O C K? But position3 must be I, not O. So invalid.

""crock"" has R and O, R absent.

So ""climb"" seems a safe choice: C L I M B.

It tests M and B, both new letters.

We can also consider ""clomp"" but position3 is O, not I.

No.

Another: ""clasp"" has A and S, absent.

So I think ""climb"" is good.

But we already thought of ""climb"" earlier.

Perhaps ""cling"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""climb"".

But note: in ""climb"", we are putting L in position2. If L is actually in position5, then this guess will be wrong, but we think position5 is unlikely because we couldn't find words.

Moreover, if we get feedback that L is not in position2, then we know it must be in position5, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""climb"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""click"", then we would have:
- C: ✓ (position1)
- L: ✓ (position2) if L is in position2, or - if not? But we are putting L in position2, so if L is in position2, it will be ✓, else if L is in position5, it will be - (since L is present but not in position2).

Similarly for other letters.

But we are hoping to get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has L in position5 to test that case, but we couldn't find a valid word.

So ""climb"" is a reasonable choice.

Another word: ""civic"" but that has I at position2 and position4, and position3 is V, not I.

No.

So I think ""climb"" is the best.

Thus, we guess ""climb"".Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: pattern **C _ I _ _**.
- **L** is present but not in position 3 or 4, so it must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: **B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

Given the constraints, the most plausible pattern is **C L I _ _** (L in position 2) because:
- No common words fit **C _ I _ L** (L in position 5) using the remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" is invalid due to H, and other options like ""civil"" conflict with the fixed I in position 3).

For the fourth guess, test **C L I M B** (""climb""):
- Places **L** in position 2 to verify its placement.
- Tests new common letters **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will confirm if L is in position 2 and provide information on the remaining positions.

<guess>climb</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  
     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  
     → **L** is present but not in position 3. U, T, S are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  
     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4. H and D are absent.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The secret word pattern is **C _ I _ _** (positions: 1=C, 3=I).
   - **L must be in position 2 or 5** (since it's present but not in position 3 or 4).
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D (9 letters eliminated).
   - **Possible letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (13 letters left, including L for positions 2 or 5).

3. **Evaluate Word Possibilities**:
   - **If L is in position 2**: Pattern is **C L I _ _**.
     - Possible words: e.g., ""click"" (tests C at position 4, K at 5), ""climb"" (tests M at 4, B at 5), or ""cliff"" (tests F at 4 and 5, but repeated letters reduce information).
   - **If L is in position 5**: Pattern is **C _ I _ L**.
     - No valid words found using remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" invalid due to H; ""civil"" conflicts with I in position 3; other options like ""broil"" or ""skill"" contain absent letters).  
     → **L in position 2 is more likely** due to lack of valid alternatives for position 5.

4. **Select Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Test **L in position 2** while covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.
   - **""climb""** is chosen because:
     - Fits the pattern **C L I _ _** (L in position 2).
     - Tests **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5), both common untested letters.
     - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct letters for better feedback.
     - If L is not in position 2 (unlikely), feedback will confirm L must be in position 5, narrowing future guesses.",Guess 4: climb -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) M(x) B(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note the feedback symbols: 
   ✓ means correct letter in correct position.
   - means correct letter but wrong position.
   x means letter not in the word.

 Since this is the first guess, we'll wait for the feedback to adjust.

 We return the guess in the required format.I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. With no prior feedback, I should choose a word that covers common letters to maximize information. A strategic starting word often uses frequent letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T, N) without repeating letters. 

""CRANE"" fits well:
- Contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E
- Includes two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Often used as a strong opener in word games because it tests multiple high-frequency letters

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct letter in correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with C and does not contain R, A, N, or E.

We need to make a second guess. Since the first letter is fixed as C, we can focus on the remaining four positions.

Constraints:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must not contain R, A, N, E.
- We have 5 letters to guess, all distinct? Not necessarily, but in this case, since we are avoiding R,A,N,E, and we know C is at the start, we must choose a word that starts with C and uses other letters.

We should choose a word that uses common letters that are not R,A,N,E to maximize information.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note that we have to form a valid 5-letter word).

Vowels: We have eliminated A and E, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels to be valid.

Given that the first letter is C, we can think of common words starting with C.

We also know that the word does not have R, A, N, E. So, for example, words like ""crane"" itself are out.

Let's think of words starting with C that avoid R,A,N,E.

Some possibilities:
- Using I: city, clipt, etc. But we need 5 letters.
- Using O: could, cloud, etc. but avoid E and A? ""could"" has O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid? But note: ""could"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D -> yes.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

We should avoid using letters that we haven't tested yet. Since we only know C is in the first position and R,A,N,E are absent, we can try to cover other common letters.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.

A good candidate might be ""cough"": C-O-U-G-H -> but H is not very common? Or ""crisp"" but R is out (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Let's list some words starting with C without R,A,N,E:

- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H) -> tests O, U, G, H
- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D) -> tests O, U, L, D
- ""chill"" (C, H, I, L, L) -> but has double L, which might not be ideal because we get less information from repeated letters. However, it's acceptable if we don't have better.
- ""civic"" (C, I, V, I, C) -> repeated C and I, not good for information.
- ""crown"" -> but has R and N -> invalid because R and N are out.
- ""climb"" (C, L, I, M, B) -> tests L, I, M, B
- ""s"" is common: ""crass"" -> but has R and A -> invalid.

Another idea: ""chomp"" (C, H, O, M, P) -> tests H, O, M, P.

But we might prefer to include a vowel. Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U.

Let me think of words: ""cloud"" (C, L, O, U, D) -> tests L, O, U, D.

""could"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another candidate: ""cushy"" (C, U, S, H, Y) -> tests U, S, H, Y.

But Y is less common.

Alternatively, ""cynic"" (C, Y, N, I, C) -> but N is out, so invalid.

We must avoid N.

So, let's avoid any word with R,A,N,E.

I think ""could"" is a reasonable choice: it uses O, U, L, D, which are common.

But we can do better? ""cough"" uses G and H, which are less common.

Another word: ""comet"" -> but E is out, so invalid.

""cabin"" -> A and N are out.

""cable"" -> A and E are out.

""chose"" -> E is out.

""chime"" -> E is out.

""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P) -> tests H, U, M, P.

""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P) -> tests L, U, M, P.

""clamp"" -> A is out.

""crimp"" -> R is out.

""crisp"" -> R is out.

""crock"" -> R is out.

So, without R,A,N,E, we have:

- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D)
- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H)
- ""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P)
- ""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P)
- ""build"" is not starting with C.

We also have ""civic"" but repeated letters.

Another one: ""cyber"" -> E and R are out.

""cowls"" (C, O, W, L, S) -> tests O, W, L, S. This seems good because it tests W and S, which are common.

""cowls"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning the covering for a chimney.

Similarly, ""crowns"" is too long.

5-letter: ""cowls"" -> C, O, W, L, S.

This tests O, W, L, S. All distinct and new.

Alternatively, ""cowry"" (C, O, W, R, Y) -> but R is out, invalid.

""cowls"" is acceptable.

Another: ""combs"" (C, O, M, B, S) -> tests O, M, B, S.

Also good.

We can also consider ""colds"" (C, O, L, D, S) -> but we have O, L, D, S.

But note: we don't know if O is in the word, so we want to test multiple vowels? We have U and I as well.

But we have limited tries.

I think ""cowls"" or ""combs"" are good.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.

According to English letter frequency, after vowels (A,E are out), the next common are: S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.

So, including S and T might be good.

But we don't have T in ""cowls"" or ""combs"".

What about ""coils"" (C, O, I, L, S) -> tests O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid R,A,N,E, which we are.

""coils"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""cults"" (C, U, L, T, S) -> tests U, L, T, S.

This seems even better because it tests U and T, which are common.

And S and L are also common.

So, ""cults"": C, U, L, T, S.

All distinct, and we test U, L, T, S.

We know the first letter is C, so we are guessing the next four.

Alternatively, ""curbs"" -> but R is out.

""cunts"" -> not appropriate and has N.

""cushy"" -> has H and Y, which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""civvy"" -> repeated V and Y, not good.

Or ""cysts"" -> repeated S and Y.

So, I'll go with ""cults"".

But note: we are not forced to use the known C in the first position? Actually, we are: the first letter is fixed as C, so we must start with C.

So, our guess must start with C.

Therefore, I choose ""cults"".

But let me confirm: C U L T S.

We are testing U, L, T, S in positions 2,3,4,5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""costs"" -> repeated S and O, but we avoid repetition? We want distinct to test more.

""cults"" has distinct letters.

""comet"" is invalid because of E.

So, ""cults"" seems fine.

But is ""cults"" a valid word? Yes, meaning systems of religious worship.

Alternatively, ""cough"" is also valid, but it tests G and H which are less common.

I think ""cults"" is better.

We can also consider ""cowps"" but that might not be common.

I'll go with ""cults"".

So, the guess is ""cults"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with C.
- The letters R, A, N, and E are absent from the word entirely.
- The word must be a 5-letter word starting with C, using only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, N, E).

For the second guess, I need to test new common letters to gather more information. I should prioritize:
- Letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, M, etc.).
- Avoiding repeated letters to maximize coverage.
- Common vowels like O, U, or I (since A and E are eliminated).

A strong candidate is ""cults"" because:
- It starts with C (leveraging the known first letter).
- It tests new common letters: U (vowel), L, T, and S (high-frequency consonants).
- All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.
- It avoids R, A, N, E as required.

This guess will help identify correct letters and their positions for the remaining four slots.

- U is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since we placed L in the third position, but it's not there).
- T is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we now know:
1. The word starts with C.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the third position.
3. Letters absent: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

The only confirmed present letters are C (in position 1) and L (somewhere not in position 3).

We need to make a third guess.

Constraints:
- The word begins with C.
- Contains L (but not in position 3).
- Does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.
- We have to form a 5-letter word from the remaining letters.

Available letters: English alphabet minus known absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S. So excluded: R, A, N, E, U, T, S.

Remaining: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: C is already fixed in position 1, and L is present but position unknown.

However, L must be in one of the positions: 2,4,5 (since not in 3).

We should also test other common letters and try to place L correctly.

We have only one known present letter besides C: L.

Therefore, our next guess should:
- Start with C.
- Include L in a position other than 3 (so 2,4, or 5).
- Use letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Common letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, etc.

Let's think of words that fit: starting with C, include L, and avoid the absent letters.

Possible words:

- Position for L: Let's try putting L in position 2: then we have C L _ _ _
  Words: clomp, climb, clung (but U is absent), clink, claimed (too long), etc.

But absent letters include U, T, S, etc.

Options for C L _ _ _ : 
  - ""clomb"" (archaic past of climb) - but not common.
  - ""clamp"" - A is absent.
  - ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> all available letters? I, M, B are allowed. This seems good.

Check letters: C, L, I, M, B. None of I, M, B are excluded.

So ""climb"" is a candidate.

But note: We have L in position 2, which is a test.

- Another possibility: L in position 4: C _ _ L _
  Words: could (U absent), chill (H, I, L twice?).

Possible: ""cavil"" (C,A,V,I,L) but A is absent.

""civic"" - I,V,I,C - but V and I are allowed? But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).

""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let's see: C I V I C.

We know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don't prohibit it, but we don't know the secret word's letter repetition.

But in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.

However, it's messy.

Better to avoid repetition if possible.

So ""civic"" is not ideal.

Another word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.

""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.

We could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.

Similarly, ""croll"" - not a word.

""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.

So perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.

L in position 5: C _ _ _ L
Words: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.

""coral"" invalid.

""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.

""covyl"" - not common.

""cabal"" - A absent.

""cecal"" - E absent.

So few options with L at the end.

Alternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _
Words: ""babel"" not starting C.

""cavil"" - A absent.

""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. 

""comply"" too long.

""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.

""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.

So perhaps L at position 2 is easier.

Thus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.

It tests I, M, B in new positions.

We might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.

What about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.

Not ideal.

""colly"" - repeated L.

Another idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.

So ""climb"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.

""cymol"" not common.

But we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.

Position: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.

This avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.

So ""child"" is another candidate.

It tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.

Compared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.

Which one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.

But ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.

Both are reasonable.

We could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.

Also valid.

So options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".

Now, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).

In ""child"", we test I at position 3.

In ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.

But note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.

In ""climb"", position 3 is I.

In ""clomp"", position 3 is O.

We don't know which vowel might be present.

Another word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.

""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.

""chilk"" not word.

So back.

I think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.

Let's choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.

Remaining common: I, O, D, L (already known), H, M, B.

Actually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.

In ""child"" we test H, I, D.

In ""climb"" we test I, M, B.

Since D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.

H is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.

H and D are more common than M and B.

Moreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).

In ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn't tested before.

We tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.

Trying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.

In ""child"", we try position 4.

In ""climb"", position 2.

Both are new.

But ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.

So I'll pick ""child.""

But note: in ""child"", letter positions:
1:C (correct)
2:H
3:I
4:L
5:D

We are testing H, I, D.

If we get feedback, we can determine about L's position.

Another possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.

""chill"" has repeated L.

So ""child"" is better.

But let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.

Therefore, third guess: ""child"".

In my thinking, I am considering both, but I'll go with ""child"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **L** is present, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).
3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.
4. The word may contain letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, prioritize:
- Including **L** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its placement.
- Covering common remaining letters like **I, O, H, D** to maximize information.
- Avoiding absent letters.

The word ""child"" fits perfectly:
- Starts with **C** (known position).
- Places **L** in position 4 (new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **H** (position 2), **I** (vowel in position 3), **D** (position 5).
- All letters are distinct and valid.
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will help identify potential letters and positions for L and other characters.

<guess>child</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - U is absent.
  - L is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - T and S are absent.

Guess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - H is absent.
  - I is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is I).
  - L is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).
  - D is absent.

Now, we know:
- The word starts with C and has I in the third position: so the pattern is C _ I _ _
- L is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess2) and not in position 4 (from guess3). Therefore, L must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So the word is of the form: C [not L? but L could be here] I _ _ 
But note: L must be in position 2 or 5. However, in position 2 we haven't tested L yet? In guess2, L was in position 3, and in guess3, L was in position 4. So position 2 is still possible.

Actually, we have not placed L in position 2 or 5 yet. So L must be in either position 2 or 5.

Also, we know the third letter is I.

So the word is: C [position2] I [position4] [position5]

And L is either in position2 or position5.

Now, the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and L, but L is already known to be present, so we don't need to test for presence, only position).

But note: we have to fill position2, position4, and position5, with one of them being L (either pos2 or pos5) and the other two from the available letters.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We have two main cases: L in position2 or L in position5.

Case 1: L in position2 -> word: C L I _ _
Case 2: L in position5 -> word: C _ I _ L

We should design a guess that can help distinguish these cases and also test other letters.

But note: we have only two possibilities for L, so we can try to fix L in one of the positions and test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position5 (to test that case) and uses other new letters for the other positions.

Similarly, we could put L in position2.

But we also need to test the remaining positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Available letters (excluding absent ones and including L): B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and L.

But L is already known, so we are focusing on the positions.

Let's list possible words for each case to see what is feasible.

First, if L is in position2: C L I _ _
We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters from available set, avoiding absent letters.

Possible words:
- C L I M B -> ""climb"" (but we already guessed ""climb""? No, we guessed ""child"", not ""climb"". In guess3 we did ""child"", not ""climb"".)
  But ""climb"" has M and B, which are available.
- C L I P P -> ""clipp"" not a word.
- C L I P E -> E absent.
- C L I N G -> N absent.
- C L I V E -> E absent.
- C L I C K -> C repeated? But we have C at start, and then C at the end? The word ""click"" is C L I C K. But we know the first letter is C, and if the word has another C, that's possible. But we haven't tested for duplicate C. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it's possible.

But in ""click"", we have C at position 1 and 4? C L I C K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.

But we have a C at position 4. Is that allowed? The feedback for the first guess had C only at position 1, and we haven't seen C elsewhere. But in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, in other guesses, we only had C at position 1.

So it's possible that C appears again? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had C as correct and the others absent, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C because we only had one C in ""crane"". Similarly for the other guesses.

So duplicate C is possible.

But let's see: if we have C at position 4, then the word would be ""click"". But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not in the absent list, so yes.

Similarly, ""cliff"" (C L I F F) -> F is available, but repeated F? And we don't know if F is present.

But let's list possible words for case 1 (L in pos2):

- ""click"": C, L, I, C, K -> but we have two C's. We test K at position 5.
- ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> M and B.
- ""clink"": but N is absent.
- ""clipt"": not common, and T absent? T is absent, so no.
- ""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> repeated F.
- ""clomp"": C, L, O, M, P -> but position 3 is O? No, we have fixed I at position 3. So for case1, position3 is I, so we need C L I _ _.

So words: 
- ""click"" (C,L,I,C,K)
- ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B)
- ""clipt"" invalid (T absent)
- ""cliff"" (C,L,I,F,F) - repeated F
- ""clink"" invalid (N absent)
- ""clyde"" (C,L,Y,D,E) - D and E absent, invalid.

So only a few: ""click"", ""climb"", and perhaps ""cliff"" (if we accept repeated F).

Now, for case 2: L in position5: C _ I _ L

We need to fill position2 and position4.

Possible words:
- C O I N L -> N absent, invalid.
- C O I L ? but we need 5 letters: C _ I _ L, so two letters to fill: position2 and position4.

Examples:
- C H I L L -> repeated L, and H absent? H is absent from guess3.
- C R I M L -> R absent.
- C A I L ? A absent.

Available: so position2 and position4 must be from B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words:
- ""coil"" is 4 letters, we need 5: C O I L ? -> but we have C _ I _ L, so for example:
  - ""cavil"" -> A absent.
  - ""civil"" -> C,I,V,I,L -> repeated I? C, V, I, L. But we have position2: V, position4: I? But we know position3 is I, so if we put I at position4, that would be repeated I. But the word ""civil"" is C I V I L? No, ""civil"" is C-I-V-I-L, so positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L. But we know position3 must be I, so in ""civil"", position3 is V, which is not I. So invalid for our pattern.

We need position3 to be I, so the word must be C [pos2] I [pos4] L (with L at pos5).

So: C ? I ? L

Examples:
- ""boil"" is 4 letters.
- ""broil"" has R, absent.
- ""choil"" not a word.
- ""coign"" -> C,O,I,G,N -> N absent, and not ending with L.
- ""coyly"" -> C,O,Y,L,Y -> but L is at position4? C O Y L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we need position3 to be I, not Y. So invalid.

We need position3 to be I.

So: C [letter] I [letter] L

Possible words:
- ""civil"": but that's C I V I L -> position2 is I, position3 is V, position4 is I. But we need position3 to be I, so it doesn't match.

Perhaps ""civic"" but ends with C, not L.

Another: ""twirl"" not starting with C.

I think there are very few words that fit C ? I ? L.

For example, ""chill"" is C H I L L -> but L at position4 and 5? And we have position3: I. So ""chill"" is C H I L L.

But H is absent (from guess3), so invalid.

""cill"" is 4 letters.

""krill"" not starting with C.

""quill"" not starting with C.

""shill"" has S and H, both absent.

""skill"" has S, absent.

""spill"" has S, absent.

""still"" has S and T, absent.

""swill"" has S, absent.

""thill"" has H and T, absent.

""trill"" has T and R, absent.

""villa"" not starting with C.

So, perhaps there are no common words of the form C ? I ? L with the available letters.

Let me check: available letters for position2 and position4: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- C O I L ? -> but we need two letters: C O I ? L? No, the pattern is C [2] I [4] L, so [2] and [4] must be filled.

For example, C O I L ? -> no, that would be 4 letters.

We need 5 letters: 1:C, 2:?, 3:I, 4:?, 5:L.

So, for example:
- C O I L L -> ""coill"" not a word.
- C O I P L -> ""coipl"" not a word.
- C B I L L -> ""cbill"" not a word.
- C F I L L -> ""cfill"" not a word.
- C K I L L -> ""ckill"" not a word, but ""skill"" is a word but not with C.

I think ""cavil"" is the only one I can think of, but A is absent.

Perhaps ""anvil"" not C.

Another: ""devil"" not C.

So it seems that having L at position5 might not be possible because we cannot form a valid word.

Therefore, it is more likely that L is in position2.

So the word is C L I _ _

And we need to fill positions 4 and 5.

From earlier, possible words: ""click"", ""climb"", ""cliff"", etc.

Now, in our third guess, we tried ""child"" which had H and D, which are absent, and L in position4 which was wrong.

For the fourth guess, we can try one of these.

But we need to test new letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""click"": which has C (position1), L (position2), I (position3), C (position4), K (position5).

But if we use ""click"", we are putting C at position4. If the word has a C there, we get feedback, but if not, we learn.

Similarly, we test K.

But we might not want to repeat C if unnecessary.

Alternatively, ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> tests M and B.

""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> tests F, but repeated.

Another word: ""clink"" invalid.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clomp"" has O, M, P but position3 is O? No, we have I at position3.

So only a few options.

We can also consider ""clyde"" but D and E absent.

So I think ""click"" or ""climb"" are the main options.

Let's choose ""click"" because it tests K and also the possibility of a second C.

But note: if the word has a second C, we would have seen it in feedback? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed C in any other position before.

In guess1, we had C only at position1.

In guess2, C at position1.

In guess3, C at position1.

So we don't know about other C's.

So ""click"" is a valid guess.

But let's see if there are other words without repeating C.

For example, ""climb"" doesn't repeat.

""cliff"" repeats F.

""clipt"" invalid.

""clink"" invalid.

""clock"" has O, C, K -> but C at position4? C L O C K? But position3 must be I, not O. So invalid.

""crock"" has R and O, R absent.

So ""climb"" seems a safe choice: C L I M B.

It tests M and B, both new letters.

We can also consider ""clomp"" but position3 is O, not I.

No.

Another: ""clasp"" has A and S, absent.

So I think ""climb"" is good.

But we already thought of ""climb"" earlier.

Perhaps ""cling"" but N absent.

So I'll go with ""climb"".

But note: in ""climb"", we are putting L in position2. If L is actually in position5, then this guess will be wrong, but we think position5 is unlikely because we couldn't find words.

Moreover, if we get feedback that L is not in position2, then we know it must be in position5, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""climb"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""click"", then we would have:
- C: ✓ (position1)
- L: ✓ (position2) if L is in position2, or - if not? But we are putting L in position2, so if L is in position2, it will be ✓, else if L is in position5, it will be - (since L is present but not in position2).

Similarly for other letters.

But we are hoping to get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has L in position5 to test that case, but we couldn't find a valid word.

So ""climb"" is a reasonable choice.

Another word: ""civic"" but that has I at position2 and position4, and position3 is V, not I.

No.

So I think ""climb"" is the best.

Thus, we guess ""climb"".Based on the feedback:
- The word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: pattern **C _ I _ _**.
- **L** is present but not in position 3 or 4, so it must be in position 2 or 5.
- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: **B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

Given the constraints, the most plausible pattern is **C L I _ _** (L in position 2) because:
- No common words fit **C _ I _ L** (L in position 5) using the remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" is invalid due to H, and other options like ""civil"" conflict with the fixed I in position 3).

For the fourth guess, test **C L I M B** (""climb""):
- Places **L** in position 2 to verify its placement.
- Tests new common letters **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

This guess will confirm if L is in position 2 and provide information on the remaining positions.

<guess>climb</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  
     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  
     → **L** is present but not in position 3. U, T, S are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  
     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4. H and D are absent.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The secret word pattern is **C _ I _ _** (positions: 1=C, 3=I).
   - **L must be in position 2 or 5** (since it's present but not in position 3 or 4).
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D (9 letters eliminated).
   - **Possible letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (13 letters left, including L for positions 2 or 5).

3. **Evaluate Word Possibilities**:
   - **If L is in position 2**: Pattern is **C L I _ _**.
     - Possible words: e.g., ""click"" (tests C at position 4, K at 5), ""climb"" (tests M at 4, B at 5), or ""cliff"" (tests F at 4 and 5, but repeated letters reduce information).
   - **If L is in position 5**: Pattern is **C _ I _ L**.
     - No valid words found using remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" invalid due to H; ""civil"" conflicts with I in position 3; other options like ""broil"" or ""skill"" contain absent letters).  
     → **L in position 2 is more likely** due to lack of valid alternatives for position 5.

4. **Select Next Guess**:
   - Goal: Test **L in position 2** while covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.
   - **""climb""** is chosen because:
     - Fits the pattern **C L I _ _** (L in position 2).
     - Tests **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5), both common untested letters.

     - If L is not in position 2 (unlikely), feedback will confirm L must be in position 5, narrowing future guesses.

Not necessarily, but in this case, since we are avoiding R,A,N,E, and we know C is at the start, we must choose a word that starts with C and uses other letters.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters that are not R,A,N,E to maximize information.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but note that we have to form a valid 5-letter word).\n\nVowels: We have eliminated A and E, so we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels to be valid.\n\nGiven that the first letter is C, we can think of common words starting with C.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have R, A, N, E. So, for example, words like ""crane"" itself are out.\n\nLet\'s think of words starting with C that avoid R,A,N,E.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Using I: city, clipt, etc. But we need 5 letters.\n- Using O: could, cloud, etc. but avoid E and A? ""could"" has O, U, L, D -> no R,A,N,E -> valid? But note: ""could"" is 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D -> yes.\n\nBut we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that we haven\'t tested yet. Since we only know C is in the first position and R,A,N,E are absent, we can try to cover other common letters.\n\nCommon letters to test: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, etc.\n\nA good candidate might be ""cough"": C-O-U-G-H -> but H is not very common? Or ""crisp"" but R is out (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nLet\'s list some words starting with C without R,A,N,E:\n\n- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H) -> tests O, U, G, H\n- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D) -> tests O, U, L, D\n- ""chill"" (C, H, I, L, L) -> but has double L, which might not be ideal because we get less information from repeated letters. However, it\'s acceptable if we don\'t have better.\n- ""civic"" (C, I, V, I, C) -> repeated C and I, not good for information.\n- ""crown"" -> but has R and N -> invalid because R and N are out.\n- ""climb"" (C, L, I, M, B) -> tests L, I, M, B\n- ""s"" is common: ""crass"" -> but has R and A -> invalid.\n\nAnother idea: ""chomp"" (C, H, O, M, P) -> tests H, O, M, P.\n\nBut we might prefer to include a vowel. Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U.\n\nLet me think of words: ""cloud"" (C, L, O, U, D) -> tests L, O, U, D.\n\n""could"" is similar.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cushy"" (C, U, S, H, Y) -> tests U, S, H, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nAlternatively, ""cynic"" (C, Y, N, I, C) -> but N is out, so invalid.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid any word with R,A,N,E.\n\nI think ""could"" is a reasonable choice: it uses O, U, L, D, which are common.\n\nBut we can do better? ""cough"" uses G and H, which are less common.\n\nAnother word: ""comet"" -> but E is out, so invalid.\n\n""cabin"" -> A and N are out.\n\n""cable"" -> A and E are out.\n\n""chose"" -> E is out.\n\n""chime"" -> E is out.\n\n""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P) -> tests H, U, M, P.\n\n""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P) -> tests L, U, M, P.\n\n""clamp"" -> A is out.\n\n""crimp"" -> R is out.\n\n""crisp"" -> R is out.\n\n""crock"" -> R is out.\n\nSo, without R,A,N,E, we have:\n\n- ""could"" (C, O, U, L, D)\n- ""cough"" (C, O, U, G, H)\n- ""chump"" (C, H, U, M, P)\n- ""clump"" (C, L, U, M, P)\n- ""build"" is not starting with C.\n\nWe also have ""civic"" but repeated letters.\n\nAnother one: ""cyber"" -> E and R are out.\n\n""cowls"" (C, O, W, L, S) -> tests O, W, L, S. This seems good because it tests W and S, which are common.\n\n""cowls"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning the covering for a chimney.\n\nSimilarly, ""crowns"" is too long.\n\n5-letter: ""cowls"" -> C, O, W, L, S.\n\nThis tests O, W, L, S. All distinct and new.\n\nAlternatively, ""cowry"" (C, O, W, R, Y) -> but R is out, invalid.\n\n""cowls"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""combs"" (C, O, M, B, S) -> tests O, M, B, S.\n\nAlso good.\n\nWe can also consider ""colds"" (C, O, L, D, S) -> but we have O, L, D, S.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if O is in the word, so we want to test multiple vowels? We have U and I as well.\n\nBut we have limited tries.\n\nI think ""cowls"" or ""combs"" are good.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to appear.\n\nAccording to English letter frequency, after vowels (A,E are out), the next common are: S, T, L, O, U, D, etc.\n\nSo, including S and T might be good.\n\nBut we don\'t have T in ""cowls"" or ""combs"".\n\nWhat about ""coils"" (C, O, I, L, S) -> tests O, I, L, S.\n\nBut we have to avoid R,A,N,E, which we are.\n\n""coils"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""cults"" (C, U, L, T, S) -> tests U, L, T, S.\n\nThis seems even better because it tests U and T, which are common.\n\nAnd S and L are also common.\n\nSo, ""cults"": C, U, L, T, S.\n\nAll distinct, and we test U, L, T, S.\n\nWe know the first letter is C, so we are guessing the next four.\n\nAlternatively, ""curbs"" -> but R is out.\n\n""cunts"" -> not appropriate and has N.\n\n""cushy"" -> has H and Y, which are less common.\n\nI think ""cults"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother option: ""civvy"" -> repeated V and Y, not good.\n\nOr ""cysts"" -> repeated S and Y.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""cults"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the known C in the first position? Actually, we are: the first letter is fixed as C, so we must start with C.\n\nSo, our guess must start with C.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""cults"".\n\nBut let me confirm: C U L T S.\n\nWe are testing U, L, T, S in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""costs"" -> repeated S and O, but we avoid repetition? We want distinct to test more.\n\n""cults"" has distinct letters.\n\n""comet"" is invalid because of E.\n\nSo, ""cults"" seems fine.\n\nBut is ""cults"" a valid word? Yes, meaning systems of religious worship.\n\nAlternatively, ""cough"" is also valid, but it tests G and H which are less common.\n\nI think ""cults"" is better.\n\nWe can also consider ""cowps"" but that might not be common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""cults"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""cults"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in the first position (✓).\n- R, A, N, E are not in the word (x).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word starts with C.\n- The letters R, A, N, and E are absent from the word entirely.\n- The word must be a 5-letter word starting with C, using only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, A, N, E).\n\nFor the second guess, I need to test new common letters to gather more information. I should prioritize:\n- Letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, I, D, H, M, etc.).\n- Avoiding repeated letters to maximize coverage.\n- Common vowels like O, U, or I (since A and E are eliminated).\n\nA strong candidate is ""cults"" because:\n- It starts with C (leveraging the known first letter).\n- It tests new common letters: U (vowel), L, T, and S (high-frequency consonants).\n- All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.\n- It avoids R, A, N, E as required.\n\nThis guess will help identify correct letters and their positions for the remaining four slots.\n\n<guess>cults</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nSo, we know:\n- The first letter is C (correct position).\n- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\nSo, interpreting:\n- C is still in the first position (as expected).\n- U is not in the word (x).\n- L is in the word but in the wrong position (since we placed L in the third position, but it\'s not there).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n1.

I, M, B are allowed. This seems good.\n\nCheck letters: C, L, I, M, B. None of I, M, B are excluded.\n\nSo ""climb"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: We have L in position 2, which is a test.\n\n- Another possibility: L in position 4: C _ _ L _\n  Words: could (U absent), chill (H, I, L twice?).\n\nPossible: ""cavil"" (C,A,V,I,L) but A is absent.\n\n""civic"" - I,V,I,C - but V and I are allowed? But A, E, etc absent. However, it has repeated I and C (C is already at start).\n\n""civic"" has I and V: but position 2 is I, 4 is I? And C at both ends. But let\'s see: C I V I C.\n\nWe know C is at position 1, so the last C is extra. But the word might not allow repeated letters? The rules don\'t prohibit it, but we don\'t know the secret word\'s letter repetition.\n\nBut in our case, ""civic"" uses C twice? But our word starts with C, so if the secret word has C only once, we might get feedback accordingly.\n\nHowever, it\'s messy.\n\nBetter to avoid repetition if possible.\n\nSo ""civic"" is not ideal.\n\nAnother word: ""civil"" (C,I,V,I,L) - similar, repeated I.\n\n""chill"" (C,H,I,L,L) - repeated L.\n\nWe could use ""chill"", but repeated L gives less information.\n\nSimilarly, ""croll"" - not a word.\n\n""crawl"" - has R and A, both absent.\n\nSo perhaps L in position 2 or 5 is better.\n\nL in position 5: C _ _ _ L\nWords: civil (again repeated), coral (O,R,A) - R and A absent.\n\n""coral"" invalid.\n\n""comal"" - O,M,A,L - A absent.\n\n""covyl"" - not common.\n\n""cabal"" - A absent.\n\n""cecal"" - E absent.\n\nSo few options with L at the end.\n\nAlternatively, L in position 4: C _ _ L _\nWords: ""babel"" not starting C.\n\n""cavil"" - A absent.\n\n""cowly"" - O,W,L,Y - but O,W,Y are available. However, ""cowly"" might not be standard. \n\n""comply"" too long.\n\n""cable"" - A,E absent? E is absent.\n\n""cable"" has E? C A B L E - A and E absent, invalid.\n\nSo perhaps L at position 2 is easier.\n\nThus, ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B) seems a good candidate.\n\nIt tests I, M, B in new positions.\n\nWe might consider other vowels: L in position 4 with other vowels.\n\nWhat about O? Like ""cooly"" but L at 4? ""cooly"" is C,O,O,L,Y - repeated O and Y.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""colly"" - repeated L.\n\nAnother idea: L in position 4 with different letters: ""civyl"" not word.\n\nSo ""climb"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, L in position 5: words like ""canal"" have A, invalid.\n\n""cymol"" not common.\n\nBut we can try ""child"" (C,H,I,L,D) -> but H, I, L, D. L is at position 4? C H I L D, so L at position 4.\n\nPosition: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D.\n\nThis avoids the forbidden letters: R,A,N,E,U,T,S absent. H, I, D are allowed.\n\nSo ""child"" is another candidate.\n\nIt tests H in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, D in position 5.\n\nCompared to ""climb"", which has L at pos2, I at pos3, M at pos4, B at pos5.\n\nWhich one tests more common letters? Both test two vowels? I is a vowel.\n\nBut ""child"" uses D and H, which are common, and ""climb"" uses M and B.\n\nBoth are reasonable.\n\nWe could also consider L in position 2 with different letters: ""clomp"" (C,L,O,M,P) -> O, M, P.\n\nAlso valid.\n\nSo options: ""climb"", ""child"", ""clomp"".\n\nNow, from an information perspective, we want to test letters that are likely to be present. Since we have limited known letters, testing multiple vowels might be good. However, we only have I and O as common vowels available (since A,E,U are out).\n\nIn ""child"", we test I at position 3.\n\nIn ""clomb"", we test O at position 3? ""clomp"" has C,L,O,M,P -> O at position 3.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for the second guess, we have L not in position 3, so putting L at position 2 is fine, but the third position can be tested.\n\nIn ""climb"", position 3 is I.\n\nIn ""clomp"", position 3 is O.\n\nWe don\'t know which vowel might be present.\n\nAnother word: ""cling"" (C,L,I,N,G) but N is absent? N is excluded from guess1, so ""cling"" invalid.\n\n""clink"" (C,L,I,N,K) -> N absent, invalid.\n\n""chilk"" not word.\n\nSo back.\n\nI think both ""child"" and ""climb"" are valid and common.\n\nLet\'s choose ""climb"" because it avoids H, which may be less common than M or B? Actually, letter frequencies: H is more common than B and M? According to English, E T A O I N S H R D L U are top, but we have excluded many.\n\nRemaining common: I, O, D, L (already known), H, M, B.\n\nActually, I is a vowel, common. O is also common.\n\nIn ""child"" we test H, I, D.\n\nIn ""climb"" we test I, M, B.\n\nSince D and H might be more common than M and B, perhaps ""child"" is better.\n\nH is more common than M? In order: E T A O I N S H R -> H is 8th, D is 11th, M is 15th, B is 16th? Roughly.\n\nH and D are more common than M and B.\n\nMoreover, in ""child"", we place L at position 4, which is a different position from the second guess (where L was at pos3 and was wrong, so now we try pos4).\n\nIn ""climb"", L is at pos2, which wasn\'t tested before.\n\nWe tested L in pos3 before, and got wrong position, so we know L is not pos3.\n\nTrying L in a new position: either 2,4,5.\n\nIn ""child"", we try position 4.\n\nIn ""climb"", position 2.\n\nBoth are new.\n\nBut ""child"" might test more common letters: H and D are more common than M and B.\n\nSo I\'ll pick ""child.""\n\nBut note: in ""child"", letter positions:\n1:C (correct)\n2:H\n3:I\n4:L\n5:D\n\nWe are testing H, I, D.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can determine about L\'s position.\n\nAnother possibility: ""chimb"" not a word.\n\n""chill"" has repeated L.\n\nSo ""child"" is better.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""child"" valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""child"".\n\nIn my thinking, I am considering both, but I\'ll go with ""child"".From the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): C is correct and in position 1. R, A, N, E are absent.\n- Guess 2 (""cults""): C is correct (position 1). U is absent. L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3). T and S are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **L** is present, but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5).\n3. Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S**.\n4. The word may contain letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the third guess, prioritize:\n- Including **L** in a new position (2, 4, or 5) to test its placement.\n- Covering common remaining letters like **I, O, H, D** to maximize information.\n- Avoiding absent letters.\n\nThe word ""child"" fits perfectly:\n- Starts with **C** (known position).\n- Places **L** in position 4 (new position to test).\n- Tests new common letters: **H** (position 2), **I** (vowel in position 3), **D** (position 5).\n- All letters are distinct and valid.\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify potential letters and positions for L and other characters.\n\n<guess>child</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n  - C is correct and in position 1.\n  - R, A, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\n  - C is correct (position 1).\n  - U is absent.\n  - L is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).\n  - T and S are absent.\n\nGuess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)\n  - C is correct (position 1).\n  - H is absent.\n  - I is correct and in position 3 (so the third letter is I).\n  - L is present but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got ""-"" meaning wrong position).\n  - D is absent.\n\nNow, we know:\n- The word starts with C and has I in the third position: so the pattern is C _ I _ _\n- L is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess2) and not in position 4 (from guess3).

In guess3 we did ""child"", not ""climb"".)\n  But ""climb"" has M and B, which are available.\n- C L I P P -> ""clipp"" not a word.\n- C L I P E -> E absent.\n- C L I N G -> N absent.\n- C L I V E -> E absent.\n- C L I C K -> C repeated? But we have C at start, and then C at the end? The word ""click"" is C L I C K. But we know the first letter is C, and if the word has another C, that\'s possible. But we haven\'t tested for duplicate C. However, in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicate letters. But it\'s possible.\n\nBut in ""click"", we have C at position 1 and 4? C L I C K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K.\n\nBut we have a C at position 4. Is that allowed? The feedback for the first guess had C only at position 1, and we haven\'t seen C elsewhere. But in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about other positions. Similarly, in other guesses, we only had C at position 1.\n\nSo it\'s possible that C appears again? But in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.\n\nHowever, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had C as correct and the others absent, but that doesn\'t say anything about duplicate C because we only had one C in ""crane"". Similarly for the other guesses.\n\nSo duplicate C is possible.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we have C at position 4, then the word would be ""click"". But we have to check if K is allowed? K is not in the absent list, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""cliff"" (C L I F F) -> F is available, but repeated F? And we don\'t know if F is present.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words for case 1 (L in pos2):\n\n- ""click"": C, L, I, C, K -> but we have two C\'s. We test K at position 5.\n- ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> M and B.\n- ""clink"": but N is absent.\n- ""clipt"": not common, and T absent? T is absent, so no.\n- ""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> repeated F.\n- ""clomp"": C, L, O, M, P -> but position 3 is O? No, we have fixed I at position 3. So for case1, position3 is I, so we need C L I _ _.\n\nSo words: \n- ""click"" (C,L,I,C,K)\n- ""climb"" (C,L,I,M,B)\n- ""clipt"" invalid (T absent)\n- ""cliff"" (C,L,I,F,F) - repeated F\n- ""clink"" invalid (N absent)\n- ""clyde"" (C,L,Y,D,E) - D and E absent, invalid.\n\nSo only a few: ""click"", ""climb"", and perhaps ""cliff"" (if we accept repeated F).\n\nNow, for case 2: L in position5: C _ I _ L\n\nWe need to fill position2 and position4.\n\nPossible words:\n- C O I N L -> N absent, invalid.\n- C O I L ? but we need 5 letters: C _ I _ L, so two letters to fill: position2 and position4.\n\nExamples:\n- C H I L L -> repeated L, and H absent? H is absent from guess3.\n- C R I M L -> R absent.\n- C A I L ? A absent.\n\nAvailable: so position2 and position4 must be from B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWords:\n- ""coil"" is 4 letters, we need 5: C O I L ? -> but we have C _ I _ L, so for example:\n  - ""cavil"" -> A absent.\n  - ""civil"" -> C,I,V,I,L -> repeated I? C, V, I, L. But we have position2: V, position4: I? But we know position3 is I, so if we put I at position4, that would be repeated I. But the word ""civil"" is C I V I L? No, ""civil"" is C-I-V-I-L, so positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:L. But we know position3 must be I, so in ""civil"", position3 is V, which is not I. So invalid for our pattern.\n\nWe need position3 to be I, so the word must be C [pos2] I [pos4] L (with L at pos5).\n\nSo: C ? I ? L\n\nExamples:\n- ""boil"" is 4 letters.\n- ""broil"" has R, absent.\n- ""choil"" not a word.\n- ""coign"" -> C,O,I,G,N -> N absent, and not ending with L.\n- ""coyly"" -> C,O,Y,L,Y -> but L is at position4? C O Y L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we need position3 to be I, not Y. So invalid.\n\nWe need position3 to be I.\n\nSo: C [letter] I [letter] L\n\nPossible words:\n- ""civil"": but that\'s C I V I L -> position2 is I, position3 is V, position4 is I. But we need position3 to be I, so it doesn\'t match.\n\nPerhaps ""civic"" but ends with C, not L.\n\nAnother: ""twirl"" not starting with C.\n\nI think there are very few words that fit C ? I ? L.\n\nFor example, ""chill"" is C H I L L -> but L at position4 and 5? And we have position3: I. So ""chill"" is C H I L L.\n\nBut H is absent (from guess3), so invalid.\n\n""cill"" is 4 letters.\n\n""krill"" not starting with C.\n\n""quill"" not starting with C.\n\n""shill"" has S and H, both absent.\n\n""skill"" has S, absent.\n\n""spill"" has S, absent.\n\n""still"" has S and T, absent.\n\n""swill"" has S, absent.\n\n""thill"" has H and T, absent.\n\n""trill"" has T and R, absent.\n\n""villa"" not starting with C.\n\nSo, perhaps there are no common words of the form C ? I ? L with the available letters.\n\nLet me check: available letters for position2 and position4: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- C O I L ? -> but we need two letters: C O I ? L? No, the pattern is C [2] I [4] L, so [2] and [4] must be filled.\n\nFor example, C O I L ? -> no, that would be 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters: 1:C, 2:?, 3:I, 4:?, 5:L.\n\nSo, for example:\n- C O I L L -> ""coill"" not a word.\n- C O I P L -> ""coipl"" not a word.\n- C B I L L -> ""cbill"" not a word.\n- C F I L L -> ""cfill"" not a word.\n- C K I L L -> ""ckill"" not a word, but ""skill"" is a word but not with C.\n\nI think ""cavil"" is the only one I can think of, but A is absent.\n\nPerhaps ""anvil"" not C.\n\nAnother: ""devil"" not C.\n\nSo it seems that having L at position5 might not be possible because we cannot form a valid word.\n\nTherefore, it is more likely that L is in position2.\n\nSo the word is C L I _ _\n\nAnd we need to fill positions 4 and 5.\n\nFrom earlier, possible words: ""click"", ""climb"", ""cliff"", etc.\n\nNow, in our third guess, we tried ""child"" which had H and D, which are absent, and L in position4 which was wrong.\n\nFor the fourth guess, we can try one of these.\n\nBut we need to test new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try ""click"": which has C (position1), L (position2), I (position3), C (position4), K (position5).\n\nBut if we use ""click"", we are putting C at position4. If the word has a C there, we get feedback, but if not, we learn.\n\nSimilarly, we test K.\n\nBut we might not want to repeat C if unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, ""climb"": C, L, I, M, B -> tests M and B.\n\n""cliff"": C, L, I, F, F -> tests F, but repeated.\n\nAnother word: ""clink"" invalid.\n\n""clipt"" invalid.\n\n""clomp"" has O, M, P but position3 is O? No, we have I at position3.\n\nSo only a few options.\n\nWe can also consider ""clyde"" but D and E absent.\n\nSo I think ""click"" or ""climb"" are the main options.\n\nLet\'s choose ""click"" because it tests K and also the possibility of a second C.\n\nBut note: if the word has a second C, we would have seen it in feedback? Not necessarily, because we haven\'t placed C in any other position before.\n\nIn guess1, we had C only at position1.\n\nIn guess2, C at position1.\n\nIn guess3, C at position1.\n\nSo we don\'t know about other C\'s.\n\nSo ""click"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words without repeating C.\n\nFor example, ""climb"" doesn\'t repeat.\n\n""cliff"" repeats F.\n\n""clipt"" invalid.\n\n""clink"" invalid.\n\n""clock"" has O, C, K -> but C at position4? C L O C K? But position3 must be I, not O. So invalid.\n\n""crock"" has R and O, R absent.\n\nSo ""climb"" seems a safe choice: C L I M B.\n\nIt tests M and B, both new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""clomp"" but position3 is O, not I.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: ""clasp"" has A and S, absent.\n\nSo I think ""climb"" is good.\n\nBut we already thought of ""climb"" earlier.\n\nPerhaps ""cling"" but N absent.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""climb"".\n\nBut note: in ""climb"", we are putting L in position2. If L is actually in position5, then this guess will be wrong, but we think position5 is unlikely because we couldn\'t find words.\n\nMoreover, if we get feedback that L is not in position2, then we know it must be in position5, and we can focus on that.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nTherefore, fourth guess: ""climb"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""click"", then we would have:\n- C: ✓ (position1)\n- L: ✓ (position2) if L is in position2, or - if not? But we are putting L in position2, so if L is in position2, it will be ✓, else if L is in position5, it will be - (since L is present but not in position2).\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nBut we are hoping to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has L in position5 to test that case, but we couldn\'t find a valid word.\n\nSo ""climb"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnother word: ""civic"" but that has I at position2 and position4, and position3 is V, not I.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""climb"" is the best.\n\nThus, we guess ""climb"".Based on the feedback:\n- The word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **I** in position 3: pattern **C _ I _ _**.\n- **L** is present but not in position 3 or 4, so it must be in position 2 or 5.\n- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D**.\n- Remaining possible letters: **B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible pattern is **C L I _ _** (L in position 2) because:\n- No common words fit **C _ I _ L** (L in position 5) using the remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" is invalid due to H, and other options like ""civil"" conflict with the fixed I in position 3).\n\nFor the fourth guess, test **C L I M B** (""climb""):\n- Places **L** in position 2 to verify its placement.\n- Tests new common letters **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5).\n- Avoids all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess will confirm if L is in position 2 and provide information on the remaining positions.\n\n<guess>climb</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  \n     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.\n   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  \n     → **L** is present but not in position 3. U, T, S are absent.\n   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is in the word but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  \n     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4. H and D are absent.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - The secret word pattern is **C _ I _ _** (positions: 1=C, 3=I).\n   - **L must be in position 2 or 5** (since it\'s present but not in position 3 or 4).\n   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D (9 letters eliminated).\n   - **Possible letters for remaining positions**: B, F, G, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (13 letters left, including L for positions 2 or 5).\n\n3. **Evaluate Word Possibilities**:\n   - **If L is in position 2**: Pattern is **C L I _ _**.\n     - Possible words: e.g., ""click"" (tests C at position 4, K at 5), ""climb"" (tests M at 4, B at 5), or ""cliff"" (tests F at 4 and 5, but repeated letters reduce information).\n   - **If L is in position 5**: Pattern is **C _ I _ L**.\n     - No valid words found using remaining letters (e.g., ""chill"" invalid due to H; ""civil"" conflicts with I in position 3; other options like ""broil"" or ""skill"" contain absent letters).  \n     → **L in position 2 is more likely** due to lack of valid alternatives for position 5.\n\n4. **Select Next Guess**:\n   - Goal: Test **L in position 2** while covering new high-frequency letters (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.\n   - **""climb""** is chosen because:\n     - Fits the pattern **C L I _ _** (L in position 2).\n     - Tests **M** (position 4) and **B** (position 5), both common untested letters.\n     - Avoids all absent letters and uses distinct letters for better feedback.\n     - If L is not in position 2 (unlikely), feedback will confirm L must be in position 5, narrowing future guesses.\n\n<guess>climb</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cults -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)\nGuess 4: climb -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) M(x) B(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - U, T, S are absent.
  - L is present but not in position 3.

Guess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - H and D are absent.
  - I is correct and in position 3.
  - L is present but not in position 4.

Guess 4: climb -> C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) M(x) B(x)
  - C, L, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
  - M and B are absent.

Now, we know:
- The word starts with ""C L I"" in the first three positions: so the pattern is ""C L I _ _"".
- The last two positions are to be filled, and we know the letters that are absent.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B.

So the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B.

Available letters: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the fourth and fifth positions with two letters from the available set.

The word is ""C L I ? ?""

We must form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""cliff"": C L I F F -> but F is available, but repeated F? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't encountered any yet. However, ""cliff"" is a valid word.

- ""click"": but C is already used? We have C at position 1, and if we put C at position 4, that would be repeated. But ""click"" is a word. However, in the feedback for guess4, we have M and B absent, but not C. But we know C is at position 1, so if we put C at position 4, it might be present. But we haven't tested that. However, ""click"" has K at the end, which is available.

But note: in guess4, we tested M and B and they are absent, but we didn't test C again.

But we are now at the fifth guess? We have two positions left, so we can try to guess the word.

But let's list possible words with the available letters.

Available: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible combinations:

- End with F: e.g., ""cliff"" (F at 4 and 5) -> but repeated.
  - ""clift"" -> but T is absent (from guess2).
  - ""cliff"" is one option.

- End with K: e.g., ""click"" -> C at 4? But we have C at 1, so if we put C at 4, it might be correct? But we don't know. However, ""click"" is C L I C K. But we have to check if C is allowed again? The feedback never said C is absent elsewhere, so it's possible.

But in ""click"", position 4 is C and position 5 is K.

- Other options: ""clink"" -> but N is absent (guess1).
- ""clipt"" -> T absent.
- ""climb"" we tried, M and B absent.

What about ""clink""? N absent.

""cling"" -> N absent and G is available? ""cling"" is C L I N G, but N absent.

Not possible.

""clips"" -> S absent.

""clipt"" -> T absent.

So, with K: ""click"" is a candidate.

With G: ""clig?"" not a word.

""clog"" is C L O G, but we need position 3 to be I, so ""clog"" has O at position 3, not I. Invalid.

Similarly, ""clip"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""cliff"" or ""cliff"" is one.

What about ""cliffy""? too long.

5-letter: ""cliff"" is 5 letters.

""clink"" invalid.

""civic"" not matching pattern.

Another word: ""clove"" -> O, V, E -> E absent.

""clone"" -> E absent.

""clomp"" -> O, M, P -> M absent.

""clamp"" -> A, M absent.

So, the only common words I can think of are ""click"" and ""cliff"".

But ""click"" has a repeated C, and ""cliff"" has repeated F.

We also have ""clipt"" but T absent.

""bling"" not starting with C.

Perhaps ""clonk"" -> O, N, K -> N absent.

""cloop"" -> O, O, P -> repeated O? Not common.

""cloot"" -> O, O, T -> T absent.

So, let's consider the available letters: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to form words:

- Position 4: F, position 5: F -> ""cliff""
- Position 4: F, position 5: G? ""clifg"" not a word.
- Position 4: F, position 5: K? ""clifk"" not a word.
- Position 4: G, position 5: G? ""cligg"" not a word.
- Position 4: G, position 5: K? ""cligk"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: F? ""clikf"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: G? ""clikg"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: K? ""clikk"" not a word.
- Position 4: O, position 5: F? ""cliof"" not a word.
- etc.

With O: ""clio"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""cliop"" not a word.

""cliov"" not a word.

Similarly, P: ""clip"" is 4 letters, so we need to add a letter? But we have two positions.

""clips"" -> S absent.

""clipt"" -> T absent.

Q: ""clique"" -> Q, U, E -> U and E absent.

V: ""clivy"" not a word.

W: ""cliw?"" not found.

X: ""clix"" not a word.

Y: ""cliy"" not.

Z: ""cliz"" not.

So, the only common words that fit are ""click"" and ""cliff"".

Now, we have to choose between them.

We can try ""click"" to test if there is a C at position 4.

If we guess ""click"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback and then can guess ""cliff"" next.

But we have two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after this).

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""cliff"", and we guess ""click"", the feedback would be:

- C: position1 ✓
- L: position2 ✓
- I: position3 ✓
- C: if the word is ""cliff"", there is no C at position4, so since C is already in the word (at position1), but we are putting another C? In Wordle, if the word has only one C, and we put C in a different position, it would show as '-' if there is only one, but if the word has two C's, it might be ✓ or '-'.

But in this case, for ""cliff"", there is no C except the first one, so the C at position4 would be:

- If the secret word has only one C (at position1), then the C at position4 would be either:
  - If the secret word has no C at position4, and no other C, then it would be marked as 'x'? But wait, the feedback for duplicate letters: Wordle handles duplicates by marking the first occurrence appropriately.

Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is repeated in the guess but the secret word has only one, then the second occurrence might be marked as 'x' if not present.

For example, if secret is ""crane"" and guess is ""civic"", then:
- First C: ✓ (position1)
- I: x (if not present)
- V: x
- I: x (again)
- C: x (because there's only one C, already used)

But in our case, if we guess ""click"" and the secret is ""cliff"":

- Position1: C ✓
- Position2: L ✓
- Position3: I ✓
- Position4: C → the secret has no C at position4, and no other C (only one at position1), so it should be marked as 'x' because the C is already accounted for.
- Position5: K → not in word, so 'x'

Similarly, if the secret is ""click"", then:
- Position4: C ✓
- Position5: K ✓

So, by guessing ""click"", we can distinguish:

- If we get C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) → win
- If we get C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(x) → then the word must be ""cliff"" (since no other options, and F is available)

But are there other options? We thought only ""click"" and ""cliff"", but let's confirm.

Another possibility: ""clink"" is invalid.

""clipt"" invalid.

""cliff"" and ""click"" are the only common ones.

But what about ""cliff"" and ""click"", and perhaps ""clipt"" but T absent.

Or ""cliff"" is one.

But also, ""cloff"" not a word.

So, I think only two possibilities.

Therefore, we can guess ""click"" now.

If it's not ""click"", then it must be ""cliff"", and we can guess that next.

But we have only one guess after this? We are on guess 5, so if we guess ""click"" and it's wrong, we have one more guess for ""cliff"".

But we can also consider guessing ""cliff"" now.

But ""click"" tests for C and K, which might be more informative.

But since we are down to two options, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""click"" because it might be correct.

So fifth guess: ""click"".Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are confirmed as **C, L, I** (positions 1, 2, 3).
- **M** and **B** are absent (from ""climb"").
- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B**.
- Remaining possible letters: **F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

The secret word pattern is **C L I _ _**.
Only two common words fit this pattern using the remaining letters:
1. **""click""** (C, L, I, C, K) - Tests if **C** is repeated at position 4 and **K** at position 5.
2. **""cliff""** (C, L, I, F, F) - Tests **F** at positions 4 and 5 (repeated).

Since **""click""** covers more letter variations (C and K) and avoids repetition in the guess, it is prioritized. If incorrect, the next guess will be **""cliff""**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  
     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is present but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  
     → **L** is present but not in position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is present but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  
     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4.
   - **Guess 4 (""climb"")**: C, L, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 (✓). M and B are absent (x).  
     → **L** is confirmed in position 2. The secret word is **C L I _ _** (positions 1–3 fixed). M and B are absent.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The secret word pattern is **C L I _ _**.
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B (11 letters eliminated).
   - **Possible letters for positions 4–5**: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (11 letters left).
   - Only two common English words fit the pattern and constraints:
     - **""click""** (C L I C K): Tests if **C** is repeated at position 4 and **K** at position 5.
     - **""cliff""** (C L I F F): Tests **F** at positions 4 and 5 (repeated F).

3. **Select Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize **""click""** because:
     - It tests **K** (a high-frequency consonant) and the possibility of a repeated **C**.
     - If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback will confirm:
       - If position 4 is not C or position 5 is not K, the word must be **""cliff""** (the only other valid option).
     - Guessing **""cliff""** first would test repeated F, but **""click""** provides more information about letter variety.

<guess>click</guess>",click,"We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: cults -> C(✓) U(x) L(-) T(x) S(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - U, T, S are absent.
  - L is present but not in position 3.

Guess 3: child -> C(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(-) D(x)
  - C is correct (position 1).
  - H and D are absent.
  - I is correct and in position 3.
  - L is present but not in position 4.

Guess 4: climb -> C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) M(x) B(x)
  - C, L, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
  - M and B are absent.

Now, we know:
- The word starts with ""C L I"" in the first three positions: so the pattern is ""C L I _ _"".
- The last two positions are to be filled, and we know the letters that are absent.

Absent letters: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B.

So the absent letters are: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B.

Available letters: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill the fourth and fifth positions with two letters from the available set.

The word is ""C L I ? ?""

We must form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""cliff"": C L I F F -> but F is available, but repeated F? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't encountered any yet. However, ""cliff"" is a valid word.

- ""click"": but C is already used? We have C at position 1, and if we put C at position 4, that would be repeated. But ""click"" is a word. However, in the feedback for guess4, we have M and B absent, but not C. But we know C is at position 1, so if we put C at position 4, it might be present. But we haven't tested that. However, ""click"" has K at the end, which is available.

But note: in guess4, we tested M and B and they are absent, but we didn't test C again.

But we are now at the fifth guess? We have two positions left, so we can try to guess the word.

But let's list possible words with the available letters.

Available: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible combinations:

- End with F: e.g., ""cliff"" (F at 4 and 5) -> but repeated.
  - ""clift"" -> but T is absent (from guess2).
  - ""cliff"" is one option.

- End with K: e.g., ""click"" -> C at 4? But we have C at 1, so if we put C at 4, it might be correct? But we don't know. However, ""click"" is C L I C K. But we have to check if C is allowed again? The feedback never said C is absent elsewhere, so it's possible.

But in ""click"", position 4 is C and position 5 is K.

- Other options: ""clink"" -> but N is absent (guess1).
- ""clipt"" -> T absent.
- ""climb"" we tried, M and B absent.

What about ""clink""? N absent.

""cling"" -> N absent and G is available? ""cling"" is C L I N G, but N absent.

Not possible.

""clips"" -> S absent.

""clipt"" -> T absent.

So, with K: ""click"" is a candidate.

With G: ""clig?"" not a word.

""clog"" is C L O G, but we need position 3 to be I, so ""clog"" has O at position 3, not I. Invalid.

Similarly, ""clip"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another possibility: ""cliff"" or ""cliff"" is one.

What about ""cliffy""? too long.

5-letter: ""cliff"" is 5 letters.

""clink"" invalid.

""civic"" not matching pattern.

Another word: ""clove"" -> O, V, E -> E absent.

""clone"" -> E absent.

""clomp"" -> O, M, P -> M absent.

""clamp"" -> A, M absent.

So, the only common words I can think of are ""click"" and ""cliff"".

But ""click"" has a repeated C, and ""cliff"" has repeated F.

We also have ""clipt"" but T absent.

""bling"" not starting with C.

Perhaps ""clonk"" -> O, N, K -> N absent.

""cloop"" -> O, O, P -> repeated O? Not common.

""cloot"" -> O, O, T -> T absent.

So, let's consider the available letters: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to form words:

- Position 4: F, position 5: F -> ""cliff""
- Position 4: F, position 5: G? ""clifg"" not a word.
- Position 4: F, position 5: K? ""clifk"" not a word.
- Position 4: G, position 5: G? ""cligg"" not a word.
- Position 4: G, position 5: K? ""cligk"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: F? ""clikf"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: G? ""clikg"" not a word.
- Position 4: K, position 5: K? ""clikk"" not a word.
- Position 4: O, position 5: F? ""cliof"" not a word.
- etc.

With O: ""clio"" is 4 letters, not 5.

""cliop"" not a word.

""cliov"" not a word.

Similarly, P: ""clip"" is 4 letters, so we need to add a letter? But we have two positions.

""clips"" -> S absent.

""clipt"" -> T absent.

Q: ""clique"" -> Q, U, E -> U and E absent.

V: ""clivy"" not a word.

W: ""cliw?"" not found.

X: ""clix"" not a word.

Y: ""cliy"" not.

Z: ""cliz"" not.

So, the only common words that fit are ""click"" and ""cliff"".

Now, we have to choose between them.

We can try ""click"" to test if there is a C at position 4.

If we guess ""click"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback and then can guess ""cliff"" next.

But we have two guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more after this).

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""cliff"", and we guess ""click"", the feedback would be:

- C: position1 ✓
- L: position2 ✓
- I: position3 ✓
- C: if the word is ""cliff"", there is no C at position4, so since C is already in the word (at position1), but we are putting another C? In Wordle, if the word has only one C, and we put C in a different position, it would show as '-' if there is only one, but if the word has two C's, it might be ✓ or '-'.

But in this case, for ""cliff"", there is no C except the first one, so the C at position4 would be:

- If the secret word has only one C (at position1), then the C at position4 would be either:
  - If the secret word has no C at position4, and no other C, then it would be marked as 'x'? But wait, the feedback for duplicate letters: Wordle handles duplicates by marking the first occurrence appropriately.

Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is repeated in the guess but the secret word has only one, then the second occurrence might be marked as 'x' if not present.

For example, if secret is ""crane"" and guess is ""civic"", then:
- First C: ✓ (position1)
- I: x (if not present)
- V: x
- I: x (again)
- C: x (because there's only one C, already used)

But in our case, if we guess ""click"" and the secret is ""cliff"":

- Position1: C ✓
- Position2: L ✓
- Position3: I ✓
- Position4: C → the secret has no C at position4, and no other C (only one at position1), so it should be marked as 'x' because the C is already accounted for.
- Position5: K → not in word, so 'x'

Similarly, if the secret is ""click"", then:
- Position4: C ✓
- Position5: K ✓

So, by guessing ""click"", we can distinguish:

- If we get C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) → win
- If we get C(✓) L(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(x) → then the word must be ""cliff"" (since no other options, and F is available)

But are there other options? We thought only ""click"" and ""cliff"", but let's confirm.

Another possibility: ""clink"" is invalid.

""clipt"" invalid.

""cliff"" and ""click"" are the only common ones.

But what about ""cliff"" and ""click"", and perhaps ""clipt"" but T absent.

Or ""cliff"" is one.

But also, ""cloff"" not a word.

So, I think only two possibilities.

Therefore, we can guess ""click"" now.

If it's not ""click"", then it must be ""cliff"", and we can guess that next.

But we have only one guess after this? We are on guess 5, so if we guess ""click"" and it's wrong, we have one more guess for ""cliff"".

But we can also consider guessing ""cliff"" now.

But ""click"" tests for C and K, which might be more informative.

But since we are down to two options, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""click"" because it might be correct.

So fifth guess: ""click"".Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are confirmed as **C, L, I** (positions 1, 2, 3).
- **M** and **B** are absent (from ""climb"").
- Absent letters: **R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B**.
- Remaining possible letters: **F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

The secret word pattern is **C L I _ _**.
Only two common words fit this pattern using the remaining letters:
1. **""click""** (C, L, I, C, K) - Tests if **C** is repeated at position 4 and **K** at position 5.
2. **""cliff""** (C, L, I, F, F) - Tests **F** at positions 4 and 5 (repeated).

Since **""click""** covers more letter variations (C and K) and avoids repetition in the guess, it is prioritized. If incorrect, the next guess will be **""cliff""**.

<guess>click</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is correct and in position 1 (✓). R, A, N, E are absent (x).  
     → Secret word starts with **C**, and R, A, N, E are not in the word.
   - **Guess 2 (""cults"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). U is absent (x). L is present but wrong position (not position 3, -). T and S are absent (x).  
     → **L** is present but not in position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""child"")**: C is correct (position 1, ✓). H is absent (x). I is correct and in position 3 (✓). L is present but wrong position (not position 4, -). D is absent (x).  
     → **I** is confirmed in position 3. L is present but not in position 4.
   - **Guess 4 (""climb"")**: C, L, I are correct and in positions 1, 2, 3 (✓). M and B are absent (x).  
     → **L** is confirmed in position 2. The secret word is **C L I _ _** (positions 1–3 fixed). M and B are absent.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The secret word pattern is **C L I _ _**.
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, E, U, T, S, H, D, M, B (11 letters eliminated).
   - **Possible letters for positions 4–5**: F, G, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (11 letters left).
   - Only two common English words fit the pattern and constraints:
