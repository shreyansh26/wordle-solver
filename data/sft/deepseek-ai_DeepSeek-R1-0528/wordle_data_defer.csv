We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - R and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (since they got '-')
 - C, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x')

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not C, A, or N.

 The secret word is 5 letters and we know:
 - Position 1: not C (but could be other letters)
 - Position 2: R is not in position 2 (because feedback shows '-', meaning present but wrong position)
 - Position 3: not A
 - Position 4: not N
 - Position 5: E is not in position 5

 We must use a new guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent)
 - Contains R and E (because they are present)
 - But note: R and E must be in positions different from their positions in ""crane"". In the secret word:
        R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, we have two other positions (1, 3, 4) to fill because we have two known letters (R and E) and three unknown.

 We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 Potential strategy: We want to test common letters and try to place R and E in other positions.

 Constraints for the new guess:
 - Must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessary, but it's helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.

 We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.

 Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).

 Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let's avoid repeats if possible to get more information.

 Some suggestions: 
 - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don't want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.

 However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.

 So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.

 Let's try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

 What about ""ROGUE""? 
 - R at position1 (avoided position2)
 - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It's allowed to guess again but it's inefficient because we know it's not there.

 However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it's better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it's not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it's not there? So lets avoid that?

 We can try:
 - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?

 Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? 

 Some common words: 
 Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.

 Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? 
 However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.

 But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.

 However, let's consider: the secret word might contain two R's? We don't know. It might contain two E's? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.

 But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? 

 Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn't. 

 How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? 
 - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay
 - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay
 - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.

 Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.

 Let's go with ""TIRED"": 
 Why ""TIRED""? It tests:
 - T at position1? 
 - I at position2? 
 - R at position3? 
 - E at position4? 
 - D at position5?

 We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D? All not C, A, N.

 Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):
1. The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not C, A, or N**.
2. **R** is not in position 2, and **E** is not in position 5.
3. The next guess must include R and E while excluding C, A, and N. Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.

Not necessary, but it\'s helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.\n\n We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.\n\n Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).\n\n Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let\'s avoid repeats if possible to get more information.\n\n Some suggestions: \n - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don\'t want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.\n\n However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.\n\n So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\n What about ""ROGUE""? \n - R at position1 (avoided position2)\n - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It\'s allowed to guess again but it\'s inefficient because we know it\'s not there.\n\n However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it\'s better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it\'s not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it\'s not there? So lets avoid that?\n\n We can try:\n - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?\n\n Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? \n\n Some common words: \n Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.\n\n Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? \n However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n\n But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.\n\n However, let\'s consider: the secret word might contain two R\'s? We don\'t know. It might contain two E\'s? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.\n\n But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn\'t. \n\n How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? \n - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay\n - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay\n - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.\n\n Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TIRED"": \n Why ""TIRED""? It tests:\n - T at position1? \n - I at position2? \n - R at position3? \n - E at position4? \n - D at position5?\n\n We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D?

We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)
Meaning:
- T and I are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked with '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of known information:
1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.
   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).
   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).
2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.
3. Known positions:
   - Position 4 is E.

Now, let's recall positions:
   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)
   Position 3: ? 
   Position 4: E (fixed)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)

Also, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.

Similarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.

So we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.

Also, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's list possible letters? But we don't know? We can consider.

We also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? 

Also, note we have to form a valid English word.

Given we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.

But note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? 

We know:
- Position 4 is E? Fixed.
- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don't know.

But note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it's still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.

Similarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it's in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don't have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? 

Moreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.

Available letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.

Also, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _
- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don't know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:

Structure for R at position1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don't know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don't know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don't have? So? Generally? We don't know if E repeats? Similarly? We don't know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.

Scenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R
- Then? Position1: ?
- Position2: ?
- Position3: ?
- Position4: E
- Position5: R
- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.

Again? We need a letter? But? We don't know? So? How can we resolve?

Alternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? 

But let me form concrete words.

First? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? 
Example words: 
- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? 
- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That's allowed? Since D wasn't placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.

Similarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R's? That's possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? 

But wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don't know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don't know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? 

But? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? 

Let's consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven't tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn't place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don't know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?

We can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:

Option: ""DWORD""? Not a word? 

Option: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? 

We must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? 
Also? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven't ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?
- Position1: D
- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?
- Position3: ? (could be R)
- Position4: E
- Position5: ? (could be R)

But? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?

Now? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? 

What English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? 
- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? 
  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: 
    Position1: D
    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R's? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: 
    ✓: correct letter and correct position
    -: letter exists? But wrong position
    x: letter does not exist

    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got '-'? Which means it's present? But not there? 

    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? 

    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R
    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.

    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? 
    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.

    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? 

    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? 

    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? 

    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? 

    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? 

    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? 

    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? 
    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? 
    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R's? And also? U and D? 
    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": 
    Position1: R
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: D? 
    Position4: E? 
    Position5: R? 

    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? 

    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? 

    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? 

    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? 
    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? 
    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? 
    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.

    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? 

    But? Which case? We don't know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? 

    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": 
    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? 
    Also? O at2? and Z at3? 

    In ""ROVER"": 
    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? 

    We want to choose one? That narrows down? 

    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? 

    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? 

    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn't capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.

    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? 

    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let's say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We'll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we'll know?

    But let's design a word? 

    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? 
    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R 
    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? 
    Letters: 
      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? 
      Position3: any letter? 
    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? 
    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? 
    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". 
    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? 
    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? 

    ""udder"" is valid? 

    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? 
    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? 
    If we put ""ORDER"": 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? 

    So? ""udder"": 
      Position1: U? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? 
      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?

    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it's ✓? Else? It's -? Or? Depending? 

    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? 

    Another word: ""IDLER""? 
      But I? forbidden? 

    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? 

    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: F? 
      Position3: F? 
      Position4: E? 
      Position5: R? 
    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don't guess D? Then we might miss? 

    Actually? We don't have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? 
    Position4: E is ✓? 
    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? 
    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven't guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? 

    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D's position? 

    Therefore? We need? 
    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? 
    - To include D? 
    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it's there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? 

    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? 
    - D at position1? 
    - O at position2? 
    - Z at position3? 
    - E at position4? 
    - R at position5? 
    This includes D? R? E? 
    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? 
    Also? Position of R is position5? 

    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an 'x'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show '-'? Because R exists? But not at position5? 
    Then? We know R must be at position1? 

    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? 

    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? 

    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? 

    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn't contain D? And? Not? So? No? 

    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" 

<guess>dozer</guess> 

Feedback will tell us?

### Reasoning Step by Step

We have two rounds of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.
   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).
   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).
   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).
   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.
- **Known letters positions**:
  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).
  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.
  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  
  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.
- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.
- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:
  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.

### Why ""dozer""?
- 📌 **Positions**:  
  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  
  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  
  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  
  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  
  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  
- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  
- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  
- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  
- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).

If R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.

<guess>dozer</guess>",dozer,"We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)
Meaning:
- T and I are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked with '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of known information:
1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.
   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).
   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).
2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.
3. Known positions:
   - Position 4 is E.

Now, let's recall positions:
   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)
   Position 3: ? 
   Position 4: E (fixed)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)

Also, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.

Similarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.

So we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.

Also, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's list possible letters? But we don't know? We can consider.

We also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? 

Also, note we have to form a valid English word.

Given we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.

But note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? 

We know:
- Position 4 is E? Fixed.
- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don't know.

But note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it's still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.

Similarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it's in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don't have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? 

Moreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.

Available letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.

Also, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _
- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don't know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:

Structure for R at position1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don't know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don't know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don't have? So? Generally? We don't know if E repeats? Similarly? We don't know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.

Scenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R
- Then? Position1: ?
- Position2: ?
- Position3: ?
- Position4: E
- Position5: R
- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.

Again? We need a letter? But? We don't know? So? How can we resolve?

Alternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? 

But let me form concrete words.

First? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? 
Example words: 
- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? 
- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That's allowed? Since D wasn't placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.

Similarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R's? That's possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? 

But wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don't know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don't know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? 

But? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? 

Let's consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven't tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn't place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don't know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?

We can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:

Option: ""DWORD""? Not a word? 

Option: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? 

We must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? 
Also? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven't ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?
- Position1: D
- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?
- Position3: ? (could be R)
- Position4: E
- Position5: ? (could be R)

But? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?

Now? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? 

What English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? 
- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? 
  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: 
    Position1: D
    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R's? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: 
    ✓: correct letter and correct position
    -: letter exists? But wrong position
    x: letter does not exist

    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got '-'? Which means it's present? But not there? 

    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? 

    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R
    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.

    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? 
    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.

    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? 

    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? 

    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? 

    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? 

    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? 

    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? 

    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? 
    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? 
    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R's? And also? U and D? 
    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": 
    Position1: R
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: D? 
    Position4: E? 
    Position5: R? 

    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? 

    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? 

    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? 

    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? 
    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? 
    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? 
    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.

    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? 

    But? Which case? We don't know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? 

    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": 
    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? 
    Also? O at2? and Z at3? 

    In ""ROVER"": 
    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? 

    We want to choose one? That narrows down? 

    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? 

    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? 

    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn't capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.

    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? 

    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let's say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We'll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we'll know?

    But let's design a word? 

    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? 
    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R 
    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? 
    Letters: 
      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? 
      Position3: any letter? 
    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? 
    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? 
    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". 
    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? 
    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? 

    ""udder"" is valid? 

    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? 
    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? 
    If we put ""ORDER"": 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? 

    So? ""udder"": 
      Position1: U? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? 
      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?

    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it's ✓? Else? It's -? Or? Depending? 

    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? 

    Another word: ""IDLER""? 
      But I? forbidden? 

    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? 

    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: F? 
      Position3: F? 
      Position4: E? 
      Position5: R? 
    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don't guess D? Then we might miss? 

    Actually? We don't have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? 
    Position4: E is ✓? 
    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? 
    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven't guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? 

    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D's position? 

    Therefore? We need? 
    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? 
    - To include D? 
    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it's there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? 

    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? 
    - D at position1? 
    - O at position2? 
    - Z at position3? 
    - E at position4? 
    - R at position5? 
    This includes D? R? E? 
    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? 
    Also? Position of R is position5? 

    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an 'x'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show '-'? Because R exists? But not at position5? 
    Then? We know R must be at position1? 

    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? 

    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? 

    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? 

    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn't contain D? And? Not? So? No? 

    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" 

<guess>dozer</guess> 

Feedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step

We have two rounds of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.
   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).
   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).
   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).
   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.
- **Known letters positions**:
  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).
  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.
  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  
  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.
- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.
- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:
  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.

### Why ""dozer""?
- 📌 **Positions**:  
  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  
  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  
  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  
  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  
  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  
- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  
- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  
- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  
- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).

If R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.",Guess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,defer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - R and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (since they got '-')
 - C, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x')

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not C, A, or N.

 The secret word is 5 letters and we know:
 - Position 1: not C (but could be other letters)
 - Position 2: R is not in position 2 (because feedback shows '-', meaning present but wrong position)
 - Position 3: not A
 - Position 4: not N
 - Position 5: E is not in position 5

 We must use a new guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent)
 - Contains R and E (because they are present)
 - But note: R and E must be in positions different from their positions in ""crane"". In the secret word:
        R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, we have two other positions (1, 3, 4) to fill because we have two known letters (R and E) and three unknown.

 We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 Potential strategy: We want to test common letters and try to place R and E in other positions.

 Constraints for the new guess:
 - Must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessary, but it's helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.

 We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.

 Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).

 Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let's avoid repeats if possible to get more information.

 Some suggestions: 
 - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don't want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.

 However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.

 So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.

 Let's try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

 What about ""ROGUE""? 
 - R at position1 (avoided position2)
 - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It's allowed to guess again but it's inefficient because we know it's not there.

 However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it's better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it's not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it's not there? So lets avoid that?

 We can try:
 - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?

 Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? 

 Some common words: 
 Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.

 Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? 
 However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.

 But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.

 However, let's consider: the secret word might contain two R's? We don't know. It might contain two E's? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.

 But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? 

 Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn't. 

 How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? 
 - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay
 - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay
 - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.

 Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.

 Let's go with ""TIRED"": 
 Why ""TIRED""? It tests:
 - T at position1? 
 - I at position2? 
 - R at position3? 
 - E at position4? 
 - D at position5?

 We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D? All not C, A, N.

 Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.

<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):
1. The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not C, A, or N**.
2. **R** is not in position 2, and **E** is not in position 5.
3. The next guess must include R and E while excluding C, A, and N. Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.

Selecting ""tired"" as it:
- Contains R (in position 3) and E (in position 4), avoiding the known incorrect positions.
- Uses new letters (T, I, D) to probe other positions.
- Has no repeating letters or forbidden characters.

<guess>tired</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)
Meaning:
- T and I are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked with '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of known information:
1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.
   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).
   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).
2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.
3. Known positions:
   - Position 4 is E.

Now, let's recall positions:
   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)
   Position 3: ? 
   Position 4: E (fixed)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)

Also, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.

Similarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.

So we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.

Also, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's list possible letters? But we don't know? We can consider.

We also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? 

Also, note we have to form a valid English word.

Given we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.

But note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? 

We know:
- Position 4 is E? Fixed.
- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don't know.

But note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it's still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.

Similarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it's in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don't have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? 

Moreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.

Available letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.

Also, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _
- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don't know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:

Structure for R at position1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don't know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don't know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don't have? So? Generally? We don't know if E repeats? Similarly? We don't know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.

Scenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R
- Then? Position1: ?
- Position2: ?
- Position3: ?
- Position4: E
- Position5: R
- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.

Again? We need a letter? But? We don't know? So? How can we resolve?

Alternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? 

But let me form concrete words.

First? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? 
Example words: 
- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? 
- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That's allowed? Since D wasn't placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.

Similarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R's? That's possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? 

But wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don't know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don't know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? 

But? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? 

Let's consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven't tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn't place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don't know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?

We can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:

Option: ""DWORD""? Not a word? 

Option: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? 

We must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? 
Also? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven't ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?
- Position1: D
- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?
- Position3: ? (could be R)
- Position4: E
- Position5: ? (could be R)

But? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?

Now? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? 

What English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? 
- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? 
  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: 
    Position1: D
    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R's? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: 
    ✓: correct letter and correct position
    -: letter exists? But wrong position
    x: letter does not exist

    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got '-'? Which means it's present? But not there? 

    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? 

    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R
    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.

    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? 
    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.

    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? 

    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? 

    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? 

    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? 

    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? 

    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? 

    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? 
    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? 
    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R's? And also? U and D? 
    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": 
    Position1: R
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: D? 
    Position4: E? 
    Position5: R? 

    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? 

    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? 

    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? 

    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? 
    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? 
    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? 
    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.

    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? 

    But? Which case? We don't know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? 

    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": 
    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? 
    Also? O at2? and Z at3? 

    In ""ROVER"": 
    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? 

    We want to choose one? That narrows down? 

    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? 

    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? 

    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn't capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.

    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? 

    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let's say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We'll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we'll know?

    But let's design a word? 

    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? 
    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R 
    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? 
    Letters: 
      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? 
      Position3: any letter? 
    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? 
    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? 
    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". 
    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? 
    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? 

    ""udder"" is valid? 

    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? 
    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? 
    If we put ""ORDER"": 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? 

    So? ""udder"": 
      Position1: U? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? 
      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?

    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it's ✓? Else? It's -? Or? Depending? 

    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? 

    Another word: ""IDLER""? 
      But I? forbidden? 

    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? 

    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: F? 
      Position3: F? 
      Position4: E? 
      Position5: R? 
    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don't guess D? Then we might miss? 

    Actually? We don't have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? 
    Position4: E is ✓? 
    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? 
    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven't guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? 

    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D's position? 

    Therefore? We need? 
    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? 
    - To include D? 
    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it's there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? 

    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? 
    - D at position1? 
    - O at position2? 
    - Z at position3? 
    - E at position4? 
    - R at position5? 
    This includes D? R? E? 
    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? 
    Also? Position of R is position5? 

    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an 'x'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show '-'? Because R exists? But not at position5? 
    Then? We know R must be at position1? 

    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? 

    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? 

    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? 

    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn't contain D? And? Not? So? No? 

    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER""

Feedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step

We have two rounds of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.
   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).
   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).
   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).
   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.
- **Known letters positions**:
  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).
  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.
  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  
  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.
- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.
- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:
  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.

### Why ""dozer""?
- 📌 **Positions**:  
  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  
  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  
  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  
  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  
  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  
- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  
- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  
- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  
- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).

If R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.

Not necessary, but it\'s helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.\n\n We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.\n\n Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).\n\n Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let\'s avoid repeats if possible to get more information.\n\n Some suggestions: \n - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don\'t want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.\n\n However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.\n\n So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\n What about ""ROGUE""? \n - R at position1 (avoided position2)\n - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It\'s allowed to guess again but it\'s inefficient because we know it\'s not there.\n\n However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it\'s better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it\'s not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it\'s not there? So lets avoid that?\n\n We can try:\n - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?\n\n Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? \n\n Some common words: \n Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.\n\n Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? \n However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n\n But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.\n\n However, let\'s consider: the secret word might contain two R\'s? We don\'t know. It might contain two E\'s? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.\n\n But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn\'t. \n\n How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? \n - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay\n - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay\n - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.\n\n Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TIRED"": \n Why ""TIRED""? It tests:\n - T at position1? \n - I at position2? \n - R at position3? \n - E at position4? \n - D at position5?\n\n We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D? All not C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):\n1.

Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.\n\nSelecting ""tired"" as it:\n- Contains R (in position 3) and E (in position 4), avoiding the known incorrect positions.\n- Uses new letters (T, I, D) to probe other positions.\n- Has no repeating letters or forbidden characters.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)\nMeaning:\n- T and I are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it\'s marked with \'-\', meaning present but wrong position).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).\n- D is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSummary of known information:\n1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.\n   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).\n   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).\n   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).\n2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.\n3. Known positions:\n   - Position 4 is E.\n\nNow, let\'s recall positions:\n   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)\n   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)\n   Position 3: ? \n   Position 4: E (fixed)\n   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)\n\nAlso, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.\n\nSo we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible letters? But we don\'t know? We can consider.\n\nWe also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? \n\nAlso, note we have to form a valid English word.\n\nGiven we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.\n\nBut note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? \n\nWe know:\n- Position 4 is E? Fixed.\n- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it\'s still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.\n\nSimilarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it\'s in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don\'t have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? \n\nMoreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.\n\nAvailable letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _\n- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don\'t know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?\n- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:\n\nStructure for R at position1: \n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don\'t know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don\'t know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don\'t have? So? Generally? We don\'t know if E repeats? Similarly? We don\'t know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.\n\nScenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R\n- Then? Position1: ?\n- Position2: ?\n- Position3: ?\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: R\n- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.\n\nAgain? We need a letter? But? We don\'t know? So? How can we resolve?\n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? \n\nBut let me form concrete words.\n\nFirst? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? \nExample words: \n- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? \n- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That\'s allowed? Since D wasn\'t placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R\'s? That\'s possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? \n\nBut wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don\'t know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don\'t know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? \n\nBut? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? \n\nLet\'s consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven\'t tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn\'t place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don\'t know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?\n\nWe can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:\n\nOption: ""DWORD""? Not a word? \n\nOption: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? \n\nWe must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? \nAlso? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven\'t ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?\n- Position1: D\n- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?\n- Position3: ? (could be R)\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: ? (could be R)\n\nBut? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?\n\nNow? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? \n\nWhat English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? \n- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? \n  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: \n    Position1: D\n    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R\'s? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: \n    ✓: correct letter and correct position\n    -: letter exists? But wrong position\n    x: letter does not exist\n\n    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got \'-\'? Which means it\'s present? But not there? \n\n    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? \n\n    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R\n    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.\n\n    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? \n    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.\n\n    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? \n\n    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? \n\n    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? \n\n    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? \n\n    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? \n\n    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? \n\n    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? \n    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? \n    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R\'s? And also? U and D? \n    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": \n    Position1: R\n    Position2: U? \n    Position3: D? \n    Position4: E? \n    Position5: R? \n\n    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? \n\n    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? \n\n    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? \n\n    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? \n    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? \n    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? \n    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.\n\n    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? \n\n    But? Which case? We don\'t know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? \n\n    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": \n    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? \n    Also? O at2? and Z at3? \n\n    In ""ROVER"": \n    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? \n\n    We want to choose one? That narrows down? \n\n    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? \n\n    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? \n\n    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn\'t capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.\n\n    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? \n\n    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let\'s say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We\'ll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we\'ll know?\n\n    But let\'s design a word? \n\n    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? \n    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R \n    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? \n    Letters: \n      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? \n      Position3: any letter? \n    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? \n    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? \n    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". \n    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? \n    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? \n\n    ""udder"" is valid? \n\n    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? \n    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? \n    If we put ""ORDER"": \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? \n\n    So? ""udder"": \n      Position1: U? \n      Position2: D? \n      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? \n      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?\n\n    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it\'s ✓? Else? It\'s -? Or? Depending? \n\n    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? \n\n    Another word: ""IDLER""? \n      But I? forbidden? \n\n    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? \n\n    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: F? \n      Position3: F? \n      Position4: E? \n      Position5: R? \n    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don\'t guess D? Then we might miss? \n\n    Actually? We don\'t have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? \n    Position4: E is ✓? \n    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? \n    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven\'t guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? \n\n    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D\'s position? \n\n    Therefore? We need? \n    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? \n    - To include D? \n    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\n    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it\'s there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? \n\n    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? \n    - D at position1? \n    - O at position2? \n    - Z at position3? \n    - E at position4? \n    - R at position5? \n    This includes D? R? E? \n    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? \n    Also? Position of R is position5? \n\n    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an \'x\'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show \'-\'? Because R exists? But not at position5? \n    Then? We know R must be at position1? \n\n    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? \n\n    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? \n\n    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? \n\n    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn\'t contain D? And? Not? So? No? \n\n    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" \n\n<guess>dozer</guess> \n\nFeedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step\n\nWe have two rounds of feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.\n   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).\n   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.\n\n2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).\n   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).\n   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.\n- **Known letters positions**:\n  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).\n  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.\n  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.\n- **Unknown positions**:  \n  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  \n  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  \n  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  \n  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).\n- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.\n- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.\n- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:\n  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.\n  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.\n\n### Why ""dozer""?\n- 📌 **Positions**:  \n  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  \n  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  \n  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  \n  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  \n  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  \n- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  \n- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  \n- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  \n- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).\n\nIf R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.\n\n<guess>dozer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""dozer"": D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- Z is not in the word at all (x).
- E is correct and in the correct position (position 4) — we already knew this.
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: D
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- The letters O and Z are absent, so we add them to the absent list.

Now, the absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.

We know the word must be of the form: D _ _ E R

We need to fill in positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains R (which we have at position 5) and E (at position 4), and D (at position 1). There might be other letters, but we have two positions to fill.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, T, I, O, Z) and also excluding D, E, R? Not necessarily, because they could repeat? But we don't know. However, since we have D, E, R already placed, and no feedback indicated duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now, but it's safer to consider the possibility.

But let's first list common letters that can appear: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y.

We need a word that starts with D, ends with ER, and has a letter in position 2 and 3.

Common words: 
- ""DINER"" -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I(x)), so invalid.
- ""DIVER"" -> V is allowed? V is not in absent list. D, I, V, E, R -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O is absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word? 
- ""DOVER"" -> O is absent? O is now absent, so invalid.
- ""DICER"" -> I and C absent, invalid.

Let's think of words with D _ _ E R.

Options:
- ""DULER"" -> not a word.
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R -> but position 4 is E, so it would be D, ?, ?, E, R. In ""DEMUR"", it's D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn't test position 2 for E. So it's possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don't have evidence against it.

Similarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn't get feedback about other positions.

So ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:
Position 1: D (correct)
Position 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown an E in position 2? We haven't tested it.

But let's see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E's, it's possible.

However, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So it's possible.

But we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

Another common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> but doesn't end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.

We need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".

So words like: D _ _ E R

Let's list possible words:
- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.
- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E's? And W is allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E's.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.

But ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven't tested that.

Another: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.

""DUVET"" -> doesn't end with R.

Perhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R. So position 2: U, position 3: P. And U and P are allowed? Yes.

So ""DUPER"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""DUMER"" -> not common.

""DAZER"" -> A and Z absent, invalid.

""DOZER"" we already tried, and O and Z are absent.

Another: ""DECKER"" -> too long? 6 letters? No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that's 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

Let's think:
- ""DINER"" invalid (I)
- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)
- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)
- ""DATER"" invalid (A)
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)
- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)
- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that's 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it's possible.

But we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that's D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn't work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.

I think I confused myself.

The pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So the word must be: D ? ? E R

In ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: R

But we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

Now, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It's in the word list.

Similarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICER"" invalid
- ""DIMER"" invalid
- ""DIVER"" invalid
- ""DOPER"" invalid
- ""DATER"" invalid
- ""DOWER"" invalid
- ""DAKER"" invalid
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let's see if it's accepted. Not common.
- ""DUMER"" not word
- ""DUNER"" not word
- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it's possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked '-', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.

""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.

Also, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.

""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.

""DEMON"": doesn't end with R.

So possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DOBER"" not word.

""DEVER"" not word.

""DAWER"" A absent.

So likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

We need to choose one to guess.

We can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.

Another: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

So let's consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

In ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven't tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.

Similarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.

We want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it's not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.

But we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.

But note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.

Are there more words? Let's think of ""DULER"" not word.

""DUVET"" not ending with R.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUSTER"" too long.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

With the missing letters not in absent list.

Letters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don't know. Similarly for E and R.

But to be safe, let's assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.

If no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.

So for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.

So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.

But Q and X are less common.

Now, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.

For example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.

""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it's possible.

But if we don't allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.

Another word: ""DAMPER"" too long.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DIKER"" I absent.

""DAKER"" A absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

""DOZER"" already tried.

So perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""DICER"" invalid.

""DISME"" not ending with R.

""DOUSE"" not ending with R.

""DELVE"" not ending with R.

""DEMOB"" not ending with R.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.

I think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.

""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.

To avoid assuming repeats, let's go with ""DUPER"".

Moreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.

So I'll guess ""DUPER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: D U P E R
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: U (new)
- Position 3: P (new)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

If it's not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.

Alternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.

But I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.

So <guess>duper</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  
  - Absent letters: C, A, N.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): T, I.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 3), D (not position 5).  
  - Correct position: E (position 4).  

- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - Correct positions: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): O, Z.  
  - **Secret word structure**: D _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, and 5 confirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1: D  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""D"" and ending with ""ER"".  
  - Letters for positions 2 and 3 must not be from the absent list.  
  - Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y (since C, A, N, T, I, O, Z are excluded).  
- **Possible words**:  
  - Common candidates: ""DUPER"" (D, U, P, E, R), ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R), ""DUMER"" (not valid), ""DIVER"" (invalid due to I), etc.  
  - ""DEWER"" has a repeated E (position 2 and 4), which is possible but less likely without prior evidence of duplicates.  
  - ""DUPER"" uses new letters (U, P) and fits the pattern without repeats, making it a strong candidate for testing.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most plausible word that fits the pattern and maximizes new information.  
- **Why ""DUPER""?**  
  - It includes U and P (new letters not tested before).  
  - It avoids absent letters and adheres to the D _ _ E R structure.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on U and P will help narrow down options (e.g., ""DEWER"" or other words).  
- **If ""DUPER"" is wrong**:  
  - Feedback will confirm if U or P are present/absent, reducing possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""DEWER"" or similar).  

<guess>duper</guess>",duper,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""dozer"": D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- Z is not in the word at all (x).
- E is correct and in the correct position (position 4) — we already knew this.
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: D
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- The letters O and Z are absent, so we add them to the absent list.

Now, the absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.

We know the word must be of the form: D _ _ E R

We need to fill in positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains R (which we have at position 5) and E (at position 4), and D (at position 1). There might be other letters, but we have two positions to fill.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, T, I, O, Z) and also excluding D, E, R? Not necessarily, because they could repeat? But we don't know. However, since we have D, E, R already placed, and no feedback indicated duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now, but it's safer to consider the possibility.

But let's first list common letters that can appear: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y.

We need a word that starts with D, ends with ER, and has a letter in position 2 and 3.

Common words: 
- ""DINER"" -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I(x)), so invalid.
- ""DIVER"" -> V is allowed? V is not in absent list. D, I, V, E, R -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O is absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word? 
- ""DOVER"" -> O is absent? O is now absent, so invalid.
- ""DICER"" -> I and C absent, invalid.

Let's think of words with D _ _ E R.

Options:
- ""DULER"" -> not a word.
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R -> but position 4 is E, so it would be D, ?, ?, E, R. In ""DEMUR"", it's D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn't test position 2 for E. So it's possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don't have evidence against it.

Similarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn't get feedback about other positions.

So ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:
Position 1: D (correct)
Position 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown an E in position 2? We haven't tested it.

But let's see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E's, it's possible.

However, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So it's possible.

But we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

Another common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> but doesn't end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.

We need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".

So words like: D _ _ E R

Let's list possible words:
- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.
- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E's? And W is allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E's.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.

But ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven't tested that.

Another: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.

""DUVET"" -> doesn't end with R.

Perhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R. So position 2: U, position 3: P. And U and P are allowed? Yes.

So ""DUPER"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""DUMER"" -> not common.

""DAZER"" -> A and Z absent, invalid.

""DOZER"" we already tried, and O and Z are absent.

Another: ""DECKER"" -> too long? 6 letters? No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that's 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

Let's think:
- ""DINER"" invalid (I)
- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)
- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)
- ""DATER"" invalid (A)
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)
- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)
- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that's 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it's possible.

But we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that's D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn't work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.

I think I confused myself.

The pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So the word must be: D ? ? E R

In ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: R

But we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

Now, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It's in the word list.

Similarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICER"" invalid
- ""DIMER"" invalid
- ""DIVER"" invalid
- ""DOPER"" invalid
- ""DATER"" invalid
- ""DOWER"" invalid
- ""DAKER"" invalid
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let's see if it's accepted. Not common.
- ""DUMER"" not word
- ""DUNER"" not word
- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it's possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked '-', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.

""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.

Also, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.

""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.

""DEMON"": doesn't end with R.

So possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DOBER"" not word.

""DEVER"" not word.

""DAWER"" A absent.

So likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

We need to choose one to guess.

We can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.

Another: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

So let's consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

In ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven't tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.

Similarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.

We want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it's not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.

But we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.

But note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.

Are there more words? Let's think of ""DULER"" not word.

""DUVET"" not ending with R.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUSTER"" too long.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

With the missing letters not in absent list.

Letters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don't know. Similarly for E and R.

But to be safe, let's assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.

If no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.

So for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.

So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.

But Q and X are less common.

Now, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.

For example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.

""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it's possible.

But if we don't allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.

Another word: ""DAMPER"" too long.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DIKER"" I absent.

""DAKER"" A absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

""DOZER"" already tried.

So perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""DICER"" invalid.

""DISME"" not ending with R.

""DOUSE"" not ending with R.

""DELVE"" not ending with R.

""DEMOB"" not ending with R.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.

I think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.

""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.

To avoid assuming repeats, let's go with ""DUPER"".

Moreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.

So I'll guess ""DUPER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: D U P E R
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: U (new)
- Position 3: P (new)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

If it's not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.

Alternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.

But I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - R and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (since they got '-')
 - C, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x')

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not C, A, or N.

 The secret word is 5 letters and we know:
 - Position 1: not C (but could be other letters)
 - Position 2: R is not in position 2 (because feedback shows '-', meaning present but wrong position)
 - Position 3: not A
 - Position 4: not N
 - Position 5: E is not in position 5

 We must use a new guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent)
 - Contains R and E (because they are present)
 - But note: R and E must be in positions different from their positions in ""crane"". In the secret word:
        R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, we have two other positions (1, 3, 4) to fill because we have two known letters (R and E) and three unknown.

 We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 Potential strategy: We want to test common letters and try to place R and E in other positions.

 Constraints for the new guess:
 - Must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessary, but it's helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.

 We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.

 Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).

 Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let's avoid repeats if possible to get more information.

 Some suggestions: 
 - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don't want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.

 However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.

 So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.

 Let's try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

 What about ""ROGUE""? 
 - R at position1 (avoided position2)
 - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It's allowed to guess again but it's inefficient because we know it's not there.

 However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it's better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it's not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it's not there? So lets avoid that?

 We can try:
 - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?

 Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? 

 Some common words: 
 Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.

 Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? 
 However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.

 But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.

 However, let's consider: the secret word might contain two R's? We don't know. It might contain two E's? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.

 But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? 

 Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn't. 

 How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? 
 - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay
 - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay
 - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.

 Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.

 Let's go with ""TIRED"": 
 Why ""TIRED""? It tests:
 - T at position1? 
 - I at position2? 
 - R at position3? 
 - E at position4? 
 - D at position5?

 We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D? All not C, A, N.

 Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.

<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):
1. The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not C, A, or N**.
2. **R** is not in position 2, and **E** is not in position 5.
3. The next guess must include R and E while excluding C, A, and N. Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.

Selecting ""tired"" as it:
- Contains R (in position 3) and E (in position 4), avoiding the known incorrect positions.
- Uses new letters (T, I, D) to probe other positions.
- Has no repeating letters or forbidden characters.

<guess>tired</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)
Meaning:
- T and I are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked with '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of known information:
1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.
   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).
   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).
2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.
3. Known positions:
   - Position 4 is E.

Now, let's recall positions:
   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)
   Position 3: ? 
   Position 4: E (fixed)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)

Also, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.

Similarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.

So we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.

Also, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's list possible letters? But we don't know? We can consider.

We also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? 

Also, note we have to form a valid English word.

Given we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.

But note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? 

We know:
- Position 4 is E? Fixed.
- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don't know.

But note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it's still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.

Similarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it's in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don't have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? 

Moreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.

Available letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.

Also, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _
- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don't know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:

Structure for R at position1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don't know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don't know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don't have? So? Generally? We don't know if E repeats? Similarly? We don't know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.

Scenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R
- Then? Position1: ?
- Position2: ?
- Position3: ?
- Position4: E
- Position5: R
- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.

Again? We need a letter? But? We don't know? So? How can we resolve?

Alternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? 

But let me form concrete words.

First? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? 
Example words: 
- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? 
- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That's allowed? Since D wasn't placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.

Similarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R's? That's possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? 

But wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don't know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don't know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? 

But? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? 

Let's consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven't tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn't place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don't know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?

We can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:

Option: ""DWORD""? Not a word? 

Option: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? 

We must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? 
Also? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven't ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?
- Position1: D
- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?
- Position3: ? (could be R)
- Position4: E
- Position5: ? (could be R)

But? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?

Now? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? 

What English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? 
- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? 
  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: 
    Position1: D
    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R's? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: 
    ✓: correct letter and correct position
    -: letter exists? But wrong position
    x: letter does not exist

    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got '-'? Which means it's present? But not there? 

    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? 

    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R
    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.

    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? 
    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.

    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? 

    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? 

    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? 

    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? 

    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? 

    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? 

    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? 
    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? 
    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R's? And also? U and D? 
    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": 
    Position1: R
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: D? 
    Position4: E? 
    Position5: R? 

    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? 

    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? 

    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? 

    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? 
    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? 
    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? 
    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.

    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? 

    But? Which case? We don't know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? 

    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": 
    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? 
    Also? O at2? and Z at3? 

    In ""ROVER"": 
    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? 

    We want to choose one? That narrows down? 

    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? 

    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? 

    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn't capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.

    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? 

    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let's say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We'll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we'll know?

    But let's design a word? 

    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? 
    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R 
    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? 
    Letters: 
      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? 
      Position3: any letter? 
    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? 
    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? 
    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". 
    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? 
    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? 

    ""udder"" is valid? 

    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? 
    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? 
    If we put ""ORDER"": 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? 

    So? ""udder"": 
      Position1: U? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? 
      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?

    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it's ✓? Else? It's -? Or? Depending? 

    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? 

    Another word: ""IDLER""? 
      But I? forbidden? 

    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? 

    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: F? 
      Position3: F? 
      Position4: E? 
      Position5: R? 
    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don't guess D? Then we might miss? 

    Actually? We don't have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? 
    Position4: E is ✓? 
    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? 
    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven't guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? 

    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D's position? 

    Therefore? We need? 
    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? 
    - To include D? 
    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it's there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? 

    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? 
    - D at position1? 
    - O at position2? 
    - Z at position3? 
    - E at position4? 
    - R at position5? 
    This includes D? R? E? 
    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? 
    Also? Position of R is position5? 

    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an 'x'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show '-'? Because R exists? But not at position5? 
    Then? We know R must be at position1? 

    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? 

    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? 

    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? 

    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn't contain D? And? Not? So? No? 

    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" 

<guess>dozer</guess> 

Feedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step

We have two rounds of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.
   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).
   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).
   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).
   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.
- **Known letters positions**:
  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).
  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.
  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  
  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.
- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.
- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:
  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.

### Why ""dozer""?
- 📌 **Positions**:  
  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  
  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  
  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  
  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  
  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  
- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  
- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  
- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  
- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).

If R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.

<guess>dozer</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
Guess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the third guess ""dozer"": D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- Z is not in the word at all (x).
- E is correct and in the correct position (position 4) — we already knew this.
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: D
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- The letters O and Z are absent, so we add them to the absent list.

Now, the absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.

We know the word must be of the form: D _ _ E R

We need to fill in positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains R (which we have at position 5) and E (at position 4), and D (at position 1). There might be other letters, but we have two positions to fill.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, T, I, O, Z) and also excluding D, E, R? Not necessarily, because they could repeat? But we don't know. However, since we have D, E, R already placed, and no feedback indicated duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now, but it's safer to consider the possibility.

But let's first list common letters that can appear: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y.

We need a word that starts with D, ends with ER, and has a letter in position 2 and 3.

Common words: 
- ""DINER"" -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I(x)), so invalid.
- ""DIVER"" -> V is allowed? V is not in absent list. D, I, V, E, R -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O is absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word? 
- ""DOVER"" -> O is absent? O is now absent, so invalid.
- ""DICER"" -> I and C absent, invalid.

Let's think of words with D _ _ E R.

Options:
- ""DULER"" -> not a word.
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R -> but position 4 is E, so it would be D, ?, ?, E, R. In ""DEMUR"", it's D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn't test position 2 for E. So it's possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don't have evidence against it.

Similarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn't get feedback about other positions.

So ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:
Position 1: D (correct)
Position 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown an E in position 2? We haven't tested it.

But let's see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E's, it's possible.

However, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So it's possible.

But we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

Another common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> but doesn't end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.

We need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".

So words like: D _ _ E R

Let's list possible words:
- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.
- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E's? And W is allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E's.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.

But ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven't tested that.

Another: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.

""DUVET"" -> doesn't end with R.

Perhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R. So position 2: U, position 3: P. And U and P are allowed? Yes.

So ""DUPER"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""DUMER"" -> not common.

""DAZER"" -> A and Z absent, invalid.

""DOZER"" we already tried, and O and Z are absent.

Another: ""DECKER"" -> too long? 6 letters? No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that's 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

Let's think:
- ""DINER"" invalid (I)
- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)
- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)
- ""DATER"" invalid (A)
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)
- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)
- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that's 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it's possible.

But we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that's D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn't work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.

I think I confused myself.

The pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So the word must be: D ? ? E R

In ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: R

But we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

Now, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It's in the word list.

Similarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICER"" invalid
- ""DIMER"" invalid
- ""DIVER"" invalid
- ""DOPER"" invalid
- ""DATER"" invalid
- ""DOWER"" invalid
- ""DAKER"" invalid
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let's see if it's accepted. Not common.
- ""DUMER"" not word
- ""DUNER"" not word
- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it's possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked '-', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.

""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.

Also, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.

""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.

""DEMON"": doesn't end with R.

So possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DOBER"" not word.

""DEVER"" not word.

""DAWER"" A absent.

So likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

We need to choose one to guess.

We can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.

Another: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

So let's consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

In ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven't tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.

Similarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.

We want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it's not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.

But we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.

But note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.

Are there more words? Let's think of ""DULER"" not word.

""DUVET"" not ending with R.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUSTER"" too long.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

With the missing letters not in absent list.

Letters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don't know. Similarly for E and R.

But to be safe, let's assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.

If no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.

So for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.

So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.

But Q and X are less common.

Now, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.

For example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.

""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it's possible.

But if we don't allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.

Another word: ""DAMPER"" too long.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DIKER"" I absent.

""DAKER"" A absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

""DOZER"" already tried.

So perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""DICER"" invalid.

""DISME"" not ending with R.

""DOUSE"" not ending with R.

""DELVE"" not ending with R.

""DEMOB"" not ending with R.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.

I think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.

""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.

To avoid assuming repeats, let's go with ""DUPER"".

Moreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.

So I'll guess ""DUPER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: D U P E R
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: U (new)
- Position 3: P (new)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

If it's not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.

Alternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.

But I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.

So <guess>duper</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  
  - Absent letters: C, A, N.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): T, I.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 3), D (not position 5).  
  - Correct position: E (position 4).  

- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - Correct positions: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): O, Z.  
  - **Secret word structure**: D _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, and 5 confirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1: D  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""D"" and ending with ""ER"".  
  - Letters for positions 2 and 3 must not be from the absent list.  
  - Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y (since C, A, N, T, I, O, Z are excluded).  
- **Possible words**:  
  - Common candidates: ""DUPER"" (D, U, P, E, R), ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R), ""DUMER"" (not valid), ""DIVER"" (invalid due to I), etc.  
  - ""DEWER"" has a repeated E (position 2 and 4), which is possible but less likely without prior evidence of duplicates.  
  - ""DUPER"" uses new letters (U, P) and fits the pattern without repeats, making it a strong candidate for testing.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most plausible word that fits the pattern and maximizes new information.  
- **Why ""DUPER""?**  
  - It includes U and P (new letters not tested before).  
  - It avoids absent letters and adheres to the D _ _ E R structure.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on U and P will help narrow down options (e.g., ""DEWER"" or other words).  
- **If ""DUPER"" is wrong**:  
  - Feedback will confirm if U or P are present/absent, reducing possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""DEWER"" or similar).

Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R?

All not C, A, N.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):\n1. The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not C, A, or N**.\n2. **R** is not in position 2, and **E** is not in position 5.\n3. The next guess must include R and E while excluding C, A, and N. Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.\n\nSelecting ""tired"" as it:\n- Contains R (in position 3) and E (in position 4), avoiding the known incorrect positions.\n- Uses new letters (T, I, D) to probe other positions.\n- Has no repeating letters or forbidden characters.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)\nMeaning:\n- T and I are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it\'s marked with \'-\', meaning present but wrong position).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).\n- D is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSummary of known information:\n1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.\n   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).\n   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).\n   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).\n2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.\n3. Known positions:\n   - Position 4 is E.\n\nNow, let\'s recall positions:\n   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)\n   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)\n   Position 3: ? \n   Position 4: E (fixed)\n   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)\n\nAlso, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.\n\nSo we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible letters? But we don\'t know? We can consider.\n\nWe also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? \n\nAlso, note we have to form a valid English word.\n\nGiven we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.\n\nBut note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? \n\nWe know:\n- Position 4 is E? Fixed.\n- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it\'s still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.\n\nSimilarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it\'s in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don\'t have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? \n\nMoreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.\n\nAvailable letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _\n- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don\'t know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?\n- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:\n\nStructure for R at position1: \n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don\'t know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don\'t know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don\'t have? So? Generally? We don\'t know if E repeats? Similarly? We don\'t know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.\n\nScenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R\n- Then? Position1: ?\n- Position2: ?\n- Position3: ?\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: R\n- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.\n\nAgain? We need a letter? But? We don\'t know? So? How can we resolve?\n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? \n\nBut let me form concrete words.\n\nFirst? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? \nExample words: \n- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? \n- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That\'s allowed? Since D wasn\'t placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R\'s? That\'s possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? \n\nBut wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don\'t know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don\'t know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? \n\nBut? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? \n\nLet\'s consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven\'t tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn\'t place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don\'t know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?\n\nWe can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:\n\nOption: ""DWORD""? Not a word? \n\nOption: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? \n\nWe must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? \nAlso? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven\'t ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?\n- Position1: D\n- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?\n- Position3: ? (could be R)\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: ? (could be R)\n\nBut? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?\n\nNow? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? \n\nWhat English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? \n- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? \n  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: \n    Position1: D\n    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R\'s? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: \n    ✓: correct letter and correct position\n    -: letter exists? But wrong position\n    x: letter does not exist\n\n    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got \'-\'? Which means it\'s present? But not there? \n\n    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? \n\n    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R\n    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.\n\n    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? \n    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.\n\n    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? \n\n    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? \n\n    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? \n\n    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? \n\n    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? \n\n    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? \n\n    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? \n    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? \n    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R\'s? And also? U and D? \n    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": \n    Position1: R\n    Position2: U? \n    Position3: D? \n    Position4: E? \n    Position5: R? \n\n    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? \n\n    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? \n\n    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? \n\n    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? \n    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? \n    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? \n    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.\n\n    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? \n\n    But? Which case? We don\'t know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? \n\n    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": \n    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? \n    Also? O at2? and Z at3? \n\n    In ""ROVER"": \n    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? \n\n    We want to choose one? That narrows down? \n\n    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? \n\n    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? \n\n    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn\'t capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.\n\n    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? \n\n    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let\'s say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We\'ll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we\'ll know?\n\n    But let\'s design a word? \n\n    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? \n    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R \n    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? \n    Letters: \n      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? \n      Position3: any letter? \n    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? \n    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? \n    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". \n    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? \n    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? \n\n    ""udder"" is valid? \n\n    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? \n    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? \n    If we put ""ORDER"": \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? \n\n    So? ""udder"": \n      Position1: U? \n      Position2: D? \n      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? \n      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?\n\n    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it\'s ✓? Else? It\'s -? Or? Depending? \n\n    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? \n\n    Another word: ""IDLER""? \n      But I? forbidden? \n\n    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? \n\n    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: F? \n      Position3: F? \n      Position4: E? \n      Position5: R? \n    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don\'t guess D? Then we might miss? \n\n    Actually? We don\'t have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? \n    Position4: E is ✓? \n    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? \n    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven\'t guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? \n\n    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D\'s position? \n\n    Therefore? We need? \n    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? \n    - To include D? \n    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\n    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it\'s there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? \n\n    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? \n    - D at position1? \n    - O at position2? \n    - Z at position3? \n    - E at position4? \n    - R at position5? \n    This includes D? R? E? \n    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? \n    Also? Position of R is position5? \n\n    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an \'x\'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show \'-\'? Because R exists? But not at position5? \n    Then? We know R must be at position1? \n\n    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? \n\n    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? \n\n    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? \n\n    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn\'t contain D? And? Not? So? No? \n\n    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" \n\n<guess>dozer</guess> \n\nFeedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step\n\nWe have two rounds of feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.\n   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).\n   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.\n\n2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).\n   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).\n   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.\n- **Known letters positions**:\n  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).\n  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.\n  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I.

In ""DEMUR"", it\'s D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E\'s? But we don\'t know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn\'t test position 2 for E. So it\'s possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don\'t have evidence against it.\n\nSimilarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn\'t get feedback about other positions.\n\nSo ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:\nPosition 1: D (correct)\nPosition 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn\'t shown an E in position 2? We haven\'t tested it.\n\nBut let\'s see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn\'t say anything about position 2. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.\n\nAnother common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.\n\n""DEUCE"" -> but doesn\'t end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.\n\nWe need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".\n\nSo words like: D _ _ E R\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.\n- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.\n- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.\n- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.\n- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.\n- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.\n- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E\'s? And W is allowed.\n\nBut we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.\n\nBut ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven\'t tested that.\n\nAnother: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.\n\n""DUVET"" -> doesn\'t end with R.\n\nPerhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R.

No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that\'s 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.\n\n5-letter words: D _ _ E R\n\nLet\'s think:\n- ""DINER"" invalid (I)\n- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)\n- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)\n- ""DATER"" invalid (A)\n- ""DUTER"" not word\n- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)\n- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)\n- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that\'s 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it\'s possible.\n\nBut we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that\'s D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn\'t work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.\n\nI think I confused myself.\n\nThe pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nSo the word must be: D ? ? E R\n\nIn ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: U\n- Position 5: R\n\nBut we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn\'t match.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: W\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n\nThis matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.\n\nNow, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It\'s in the word list.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""DICER"" invalid\n- ""DIMER"" invalid\n- ""DIVER"" invalid\n- ""DOPER"" invalid\n- ""DATER"" invalid\n- ""DOWER"" invalid\n- ""DAKER"" invalid\n- ""DUTER"" not word\n- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let\'s see if it\'s accepted. Not common.\n- ""DUMER"" not word\n- ""DUNER"" not word\n- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it\'s possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked \'-\', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.\n\n""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.\n\nAlso, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.\n\n""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.\n\n""DEMON"": doesn\'t end with R.\n\nSo possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.\n\n""DUKER"" not word.\n\n""DOBER"" not word.\n\n""DEVER"" not word.\n\n""DAWER"" A absent.\n\nSo likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.\n\n""DUXES"" not ending with R.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".\n\nIn ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven\'t tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.\n\nWe want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it\'s not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.\n\nBut we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.\n\nAre there more words? Let\'s think of ""DULER"" not word.\n\n""DUVET"" not ending with R.\n\n""DUMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUSTER"" too long.\n\n5-letter words: D _ _ E R\n\nWith the missing letters not in absent list.\n\nLetters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don\'t know. Similarly for E and R.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.\n\nIf no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.\n\nSo for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.\n\nSo available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.\n\nBut Q and X are less common.\n\nNow, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.\n\nFor example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.\n\n""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it\'s possible.\n\nBut if we don\'t allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""DAMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUKER"" not word.\n\n""DIKER"" I absent.\n\n""DAKER"" A absent.\n\n""DUXES"" not ending with R.\n\n""DOZER"" already tried.\n\nSo perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""DICER"" invalid.\n\n""DISME"" not ending with R.\n\n""DOUSE"" not ending with R.\n\n""DELVE"" not ending with R.\n\n""DEMOB"" not ending with R.\n\nPerhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.\n\nI think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.\n\n""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.\n\nTo avoid assuming repeats, let\'s go with ""DUPER"".\n\nMoreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""DUPER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: D U P E R\n- Position 1: D (correct)\n- Position 2: U (new)\n- Position 3: P (new)\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R (correct)\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.\n\nBut I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo <guess>duper</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  \n  - Absent letters: C, A, N.  \n  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  \n  - Absent letters (add to previous): T, I.  \n  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 3), D (not position 5).  \n  - Correct position: E (position 4).  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  \n  - Correct positions: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  \n  - Absent letters (add to previous): O, Z.  \n  - **Secret word structure**: D _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, and 5 confirmed).  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  \n  - Position 1: D  \n  - Position 4: E  \n  - Position 5: R  \n- **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n- **Constraints**:  \n  - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""D"" and ending with ""ER"".  \n  - Letters for positions 2 and 3 must not be from the absent list.  \n  - Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y (since C, A, N, T, I, O, Z are excluded).  \n- **Possible words**:  \n  - Common candidates: ""DUPER"" (D, U, P, E, R), ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R), ""DUMER"" (not valid), ""DIVER"" (invalid due to I), etc.  \n  - ""DEWER"" has a repeated E (position 2 and 4), which is possible but less likely without prior evidence of duplicates.  \n  - ""DUPER"" uses new letters (U, P) and fits the pattern without repeats, making it a strong candidate for testing.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Goal**: Test the most plausible word that fits the pattern and maximizes new information.  \n- **Why ""DUPER""?**  \n  - It includes U and P (new letters not tested before).  \n  - It avoids absent letters and adheres to the D _ _ E R structure.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on U and P will help narrow down options (e.g., ""DEWER"" or other words).  \n- **If ""DUPER"" is wrong**:  \n  - Feedback will confirm if U or P are present/absent, reducing possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""DEWER"" or similar).\n\n<guess>duper</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: duper -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the fourth guess ""duper"": D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct (position 1).
- U is absent from the secret word (x).
- P is absent from the secret word (x).
- E is correct (position 4).
- R is correct (position 5).

So, we can add U and P to the list of absent letters. The absent letters are now: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P.

The secret word is D _ _ E R.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The available letters for positions 2 and 3 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y (since the absent letters are excluded).

We must find a word of the form D X Y E R, where X and Y are from the available letters.

Common words that fit:
- ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R) — note that it has E in position 2, which would be a repeated E. But E is already at position 4, so if ""DEWER"" is the word, position 2 is E and position 3 is W.
- Other possibilities: 
  - ""DIVER"" — I is absent, so invalid.
  - ""DATER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DOBER"" — O is absent.
  - ""DAKER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DEMUR"" — but position 4 would have to be E, and ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, but U is absent and the pattern doesn't match because position 4 is U, not E.

Given U and P are now absent, ""DUPER"" is eliminated.

Now, for ""DEWER"": 
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

Is ""DEWER"" a valid word? Yes, it means one that dewes or a tawer.

Alternatively, are there other words?
- ""DYKER"" — D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""Diker"" is one who digs ditches? But spelling? Usually ""diker"" and it's acceptable? But let's see: positions 2: Y, 3: K. But we don't have evidence.
- ""DIMER"" — I absent.
- ""DAMER"" — A absent.
- ""DOWRY"" — not matching pattern, ends with Y.
- ""DOXED"" — not ending with R.

Given the constraints, ""DEWER"" seems a strong candidate because we've tested and eliminated many letters.

But note: in previous guesses, we have not tested W at all? So W could be present.

Moreover, we haven't tested E at position 2? In this word, E is repeated? Which is possible.

Another word: ""DWYER"" — proper noun? Not common.

Or ""DELER"" — not a word.

""DEVEL"" — not ending with R.

Given that, ""DEWER"" is the most plausible guess? But let's see if we can confirm.

But we have two attempts left? So we can guess ""DEWER"".

If not, another possibility is ""D (letter1) (letter2) E R"", with letter1 and letter2 being new? But few options.

After U and P are absent, the remaining letters? We can try B? F? G? Etc? But ""DEWER"" is a candidate? 

Wait, we should note: In the word ""DEWER"", position 2 is E? Which would be a repeat? But we haven't had feedback indicating an E elsewhere? However, it could be.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible 5-letter words matching D _ _ E R without using absent letters? 

If we don't allow E at position 2? Then what? We have no other common words? 

For example: ""D W E E R""? But that's not how words work.

Words: 
- With position 2: not E? Then possibilities: 
  - ""DAVER"" — A absent? 
  - ""DIVER"" — I absent? 
  - ""DOVES"" — O absent? And doesn't end with R?
  - ""DIMER"" — I absent?
  - ""DADES"" — A absent?

Actually, with the absent list, it seems ""DEWER"" is one of the few words that fit? 

Another: ""DEMEN"" — not ending with R.

I think ""DEWER"" is the best bet? But let's consider: In guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'? Then in guess 2, E at position 4 was ✓. So if there was an E at position 2, it would not have been tested? So it's possible.

Moreover, in ""dozer"" and ""duper"", we didn't have E at position 2? So we didn't test it.

Therefore, I will guess ""DEWER"" as the fifth guess.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback  
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  
  - **Absent**: C, A, N.  
  - **Present but misplaced**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  
- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  
  - **Absent (add)**: T, I.  
  - **Correct position**: E (position 4).  
  - **Misplaced**: D (not position 5).  
- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - **Absent (add)**: O, Z.  
- **Guess 4: ""duper"" → D(✓), U(❌), P(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5) (reaffirmed).  
  - **Absent (add)**: U, P.  
- **Summary**:  
  - **Secret word structure**: `D _ _ E R`.  
  - **Confirmed letters/positions**: D (1), E (4), R (5).  
  - **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P → **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y.  
  - **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  

### Deductions for Fifth Guess  
- The only valid English word fitting `D _ _ E R` with remaining letters is **""DEWER""** (D-E-W-E-R, meaning a person/thing that dewes or a tawer).  
  - Position 2 = E (possible repeat, given E is at position 4).  
  - Position 3 = W (available letter).  
- Why ""DEWER""?  
  - Tests E at position 2 (new position for E) and W (new letter).  
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback on E/W presence/position refines possibilities.  

<guess>DEWER</guess>",dewer,"We have feedback from the fourth guess ""duper"": D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct (position 1).
- U is absent from the secret word (x).
- P is absent from the secret word (x).
- E is correct (position 4).
- R is correct (position 5).

So, we can add U and P to the list of absent letters. The absent letters are now: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P.

The secret word is D _ _ E R.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The available letters for positions 2 and 3 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y (since the absent letters are excluded).

We must find a word of the form D X Y E R, where X and Y are from the available letters.

Common words that fit:
- ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R) — note that it has E in position 2, which would be a repeated E. But E is already at position 4, so if ""DEWER"" is the word, position 2 is E and position 3 is W.
- Other possibilities: 
  - ""DIVER"" — I is absent, so invalid.
  - ""DATER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DOBER"" — O is absent.
  - ""DAKER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DEMUR"" — but position 4 would have to be E, and ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, but U is absent and the pattern doesn't match because position 4 is U, not E.

Given U and P are now absent, ""DUPER"" is eliminated.

Now, for ""DEWER"": 
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

Is ""DEWER"" a valid word? Yes, it means one that dewes or a tawer.

Alternatively, are there other words?
- ""DYKER"" — D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""Diker"" is one who digs ditches? But spelling? Usually ""diker"" and it's acceptable? But let's see: positions 2: Y, 3: K. But we don't have evidence.
- ""DIMER"" — I absent.
- ""DAMER"" — A absent.
- ""DOWRY"" — not matching pattern, ends with Y.
- ""DOXED"" — not ending with R.

Given the constraints, ""DEWER"" seems a strong candidate because we've tested and eliminated many letters.

But note: in previous guesses, we have not tested W at all? So W could be present.

Moreover, we haven't tested E at position 2? In this word, E is repeated? Which is possible.

Another word: ""DWYER"" — proper noun? Not common.

Or ""DELER"" — not a word.

""DEVEL"" — not ending with R.

Given that, ""DEWER"" is the most plausible guess? But let's see if we can confirm.

But we have two attempts left? So we can guess ""DEWER"".

If not, another possibility is ""D (letter1) (letter2) E R"", with letter1 and letter2 being new? But few options.

After U and P are absent, the remaining letters? We can try B? F? G? Etc? But ""DEWER"" is a candidate? 

Wait, we should note: In the word ""DEWER"", position 2 is E? Which would be a repeat? But we haven't had feedback indicating an E elsewhere? However, it could be.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible 5-letter words matching D _ _ E R without using absent letters? 

If we don't allow E at position 2? Then what? We have no other common words? 

For example: ""D W E E R""? But that's not how words work.

Words: 
- With position 2: not E? Then possibilities: 
  - ""DAVER"" — A absent? 
  - ""DIVER"" — I absent? 
  - ""DOVES"" — O absent? And doesn't end with R?
  - ""DIMER"" — I absent?
  - ""DADES"" — A absent?

Actually, with the absent list, it seems ""DEWER"" is one of the few words that fit? 

Another: ""DEMEN"" — not ending with R.

I think ""DEWER"" is the best bet? But let's consider: In guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'? Then in guess 2, E at position 4 was ✓. So if there was an E at position 2, it would not have been tested? So it's possible.

Moreover, in ""dozer"" and ""duper"", we didn't have E at position 2? So we didn't test it.

Therefore, I will guess ""DEWER"" as the fifth guess.

### Deductions for Fifth Guess  
- The only valid English word fitting `D _ _ E R` with remaining letters is **""DEWER""** (D-E-W-E-R, meaning a person/thing that dewes or a tawer).  
  - Position 2 = E (possible repeat, given E is at position 4).  
  - Position 3 = W (available letter).  
- Why ""DEWER""?  
  - Tests E at position 2 (new position for E) and W (new letter).  
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback on E/W presence/position refines possibilities.",Guess 5: dewer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - R and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (since they got '-')
 - C, A, N are not in the secret word at all (marked with 'x')

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letters R and E, but not C, A, or N.

 The secret word is 5 letters and we know:
 - Position 1: not C (but could be other letters)
 - Position 2: R is not in position 2 (because feedback shows '-', meaning present but wrong position)
 - Position 3: not A
 - Position 4: not N
 - Position 5: E is not in position 5

 We must use a new guess that:
 - Does not contain C, A, N (since they are absent)
 - Contains R and E (because they are present)
 - But note: R and E must be in positions different from their positions in ""crane"". In the secret word:
        R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, we have two other positions (1, 3, 4) to fill because we have two known letters (R and E) and three unknown.

 We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

 Potential strategy: We want to test common letters and try to place R and E in other positions.

 Constraints for the new guess:
 - Must have 5 distinct letters? Not necessary, but it's helpful to avoid repeats to maximize information.

 We know the word has R and E. We also know that the word does not have C, A or N.

 Considering English words, we can look for words that have R and E and three other letters (not C, A, N).

 Example words: ""RIPER"" -> but has repeated R? Let's avoid repeats if possible to get more information.

 Some suggestions: 
 - ""ROUSE"": contains R (position1), O, U, S, E (position5) -> but E is in position5 again? We know E is not in position5, so we don't want to put E at the end again? Actually, we can put E in any other position? But note: we know E is present and not in position5, so we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R cannot be in position2? So we can put R in positions 1,3,4,5? But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.

 However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.

 So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.

 Let's try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.

 What about ""ROGUE""? 
 - R at position1 (avoided position2)
 - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It's allowed to guess again but it's inefficient because we know it's not there.

 However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it's better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it's not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it's not there? So lets avoid that?

 We can try:
 - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?

 Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? 

 Some common words: 
 Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.

 Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? 
 However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.

 But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.

 However, let's consider: the secret word might contain two R's? We don't know. It might contain two E's? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.

 But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? 

 Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn't. 

 How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? 
 - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay
 - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay
 - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.

 Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.

 Let's go with ""TIRED"": 
 Why ""TIRED""? It tests:
 - T at position1? 
 - I at position2? 
 - R at position3? 
 - E at position4? 
 - D at position5?

 We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D? All not C, A, N.

 Therefore, I choose ""TIRED"" as the second guess.

<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C❌, R➖, N❌, A❌, E➖):
1. The secret word contains **R** and **E**, but **not C, A, or N**.
2. **R** is not in position 2, and **E** is not in position 5.
3. The next guess must include R and E while excluding C, A, and N. Letters should be tested in new positions to maximize information.

Selecting ""tired"" as it:
- Contains R (in position 3) and E (in position 4), avoiding the known incorrect positions.
- Uses new letters (T, I, D) to probe other positions.
- Has no repeating letters or forbidden characters.

<guess>tired</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""tired"" -> T(x), I(x), R(-), E(✓), D(-)
Meaning:
- T and I are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked with '-', meaning present but wrong position).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""tired"", E is the 4th letter).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of known information:
1. The secret word contains: R, E, D.
   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).
   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).
   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).
2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.
3. Known positions:
   - Position 4 is E.

Now, let's recall positions:
   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)
   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)
   Position 3: ? 
   Position 4: E (fixed)
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)

Also, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.

Similarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.

So we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.

Also, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's list possible letters? But we don't know? We can consider.

We also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? 

Also, note we have to form a valid English word.

Given we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.

But note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? 

We know:
- Position 4 is E? Fixed.
- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don't know.

But note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it's still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.

Similarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it's in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don't have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? 

Moreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.

Available letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.

Also, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _
- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don't know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?
- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:

Structure for R at position1: 
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don't know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don't know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don't have? So? Generally? We don't know if E repeats? Similarly? We don't know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.

Scenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R
- Then? Position1: ?
- Position2: ?
- Position3: ?
- Position4: E
- Position5: R
- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.

Again? We need a letter? But? We don't know? So? How can we resolve?

Alternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? 

But let me form concrete words.

First? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? 
Example words: 
- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? 
- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That's allowed? Since D wasn't placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.

Similarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R's? That's possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? 

But wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don't know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don't know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? 

But? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? 

Let's consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven't tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn't place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don't know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?

We can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:

Option: ""DWORD""? Not a word? 

Option: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? 

We must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? 
Also? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven't ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?
- Position1: D
- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?
- Position3: ? (could be R)
- Position4: E
- Position5: ? (could be R)

But? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?

Now? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? 

What English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? 
- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? 
  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: 
    Position1: D
    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R's? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: 
    ✓: correct letter and correct position
    -: letter exists? But wrong position
    x: letter does not exist

    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got '-'? Which means it's present? But not there? 

    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? 

    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R
    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.

    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? 
    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.

    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? 

    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? 

    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? 

    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? 

    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? 

    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? 

    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? 
    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? 
    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R's? And also? U and D? 
    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": 
    Position1: R
    Position2: U? 
    Position3: D? 
    Position4: E? 
    Position5: R? 

    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? 

    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? 

    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? 

    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? 
    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? 
    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? 
    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.

    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? 

    But? Which case? We don't know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? 

    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": 
    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? 
    Also? O at2? and Z at3? 

    In ""ROVER"": 
    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? 

    We want to choose one? That narrows down? 

    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? 

    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? 

    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn't capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.

    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? 

    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let's say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We'll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we'll know?

    But let's design a word? 

    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? 
    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R 
    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? 
    Letters: 
      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? 
      Position3: any letter? 
    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? 
    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? 
    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". 
    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? 
    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? 

    ""udder"" is valid? 

    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? 
    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? 
    If we put ""ORDER"": 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? 

    So? ""udder"": 
      Position1: U? 
      Position2: D? 
      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? 
      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?

    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it's ✓? Else? It's -? Or? Depending? 

    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? 

    Another word: ""IDLER""? 
      But I? forbidden? 

    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? 

    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? 
      Position1: O? 
      Position2: F? 
      Position3: F? 
      Position4: E? 
      Position5: R? 
    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don't guess D? Then we might miss? 

    Actually? We don't have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? 
    Position4: E is ✓? 
    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? 
    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven't guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? 

    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D's position? 

    Therefore? We need? 
    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? 
    - To include D? 
    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it's there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? 

    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? 
    - D at position1? 
    - O at position2? 
    - Z at position3? 
    - E at position4? 
    - R at position5? 
    This includes D? R? E? 
    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? 
    Also? Position of R is position5? 

    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an 'x'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show '-'? Because R exists? But not at position5? 
    Then? We know R must be at position1? 

    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? 

    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? 

    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? 

    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn't contain D? And? Not? So? No? 

    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" 

<guess>dozer</guess> 

Feedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step

We have two rounds of feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.
   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).
   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.

2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**
   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).
   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).
   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.
- **Known letters positions**:
  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).
  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.
  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.
- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.
- **Unknown positions**:  
  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  
  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  
  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.
- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.
- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:
  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.
  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.

### Why ""dozer""?
- 📌 **Positions**:  
  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  
  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  
  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  
  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  
  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  
- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  
- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  
- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  
- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).

If R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.

<guess>dozer</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
Guess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the third guess ""dozer"": D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is not in the word at all (x).
- Z is not in the word at all (x).
- E is correct and in the correct position (position 4) — we already knew this.
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 5).

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: D
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- The letters O and Z are absent, so we add them to the absent list.

Now, the absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.

We know the word must be of the form: D _ _ E R

We need to fill in positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains R (which we have at position 5) and E (at position 4), and D (at position 1). There might be other letters, but we have two positions to fill.

We must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, T, I, O, Z) and also excluding D, E, R? Not necessarily, because they could repeat? But we don't know. However, since we have D, E, R already placed, and no feedback indicated duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now, but it's safer to consider the possibility.

But let's first list common letters that can appear: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y.

We need a word that starts with D, ends with ER, and has a letter in position 2 and 3.

Common words: 
- ""DINER"" -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I(x)), so invalid.
- ""DIVER"" -> V is allowed? V is not in absent list. D, I, V, E, R -> but I is absent, so invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O is absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word? 
- ""DOVER"" -> O is absent? O is now absent, so invalid.
- ""DICER"" -> I and C absent, invalid.

Let's think of words with D _ _ E R.

Options:
- ""DULER"" -> not a word.
- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R -> but position 4 is E, so it would be D, ?, ?, E, R. In ""DEMUR"", it's D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E's? But we don't know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn't test position 2 for E. So it's possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don't have evidence against it.

Similarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn't get feedback about other positions.

So ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:
Position 1: D (correct)
Position 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn't shown an E in position 2? We haven't tested it.

But let's see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E's, it's possible.

However, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So it's possible.

But we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.

Another common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> but doesn't end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.

We need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".

So words like: D _ _ E R

Let's list possible words:
- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.
- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.
- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.
- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E's? And W is allowed.

But we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E's.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.

But ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven't tested that.

Another: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.

""DUVET"" -> doesn't end with R.

Perhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R. So position 2: U, position 3: P. And U and P are allowed? Yes.

So ""DUPER"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""DUMER"" -> not common.

""DAZER"" -> A and Z absent, invalid.

""DOZER"" we already tried, and O and Z are absent.

Another: ""DECKER"" -> too long? 6 letters? No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that's 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

Let's think:
- ""DINER"" invalid (I)
- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)
- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)
- ""DATER"" invalid (A)
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)
- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)
- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that's 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it's possible.

But we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.

Similarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that's D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn't work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.

I think I confused myself.

The pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

So the word must be: D ? ? E R

In ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: U
- Position 5: R

But we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

Now, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It's in the word list.

Similarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICER"" invalid
- ""DIMER"" invalid
- ""DIVER"" invalid
- ""DOPER"" invalid
- ""DATER"" invalid
- ""DOWER"" invalid
- ""DAKER"" invalid
- ""DUTER"" not word
- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let's see if it's accepted. Not common.
- ""DUMER"" not word
- ""DUNER"" not word
- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it's possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked '-', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.

""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.

Also, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.

""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.

""DEMON"": doesn't end with R.

So possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DOBER"" not word.

""DEVER"" not word.

""DAWER"" A absent.

So likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

We need to choose one to guess.

We can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.

Another: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

So let's consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".

In ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven't tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.

Similarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.

We want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it's not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.

But we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.

But note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it's correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.

Are there more words? Let's think of ""DULER"" not word.

""DUVET"" not ending with R.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUSTER"" too long.

5-letter words: D _ _ E R

With the missing letters not in absent list.

Letters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don't know. Similarly for E and R.

But to be safe, let's assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.

If no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.

So for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.

So available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.

But Q and X are less common.

Now, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.

For example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.

""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it's possible.

But if we don't allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.

Similarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.

Another word: ""DAMPER"" too long.

""DUMPER"" too long.

""DUKER"" not word.

""DIKER"" I absent.

""DAKER"" A absent.

""DUXES"" not ending with R.

""DOZER"" already tried.

So perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""DICER"" invalid.

""DISME"" not ending with R.

""DOUSE"" not ending with R.

""DELVE"" not ending with R.

""DEMOB"" not ending with R.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.

I think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.

""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.

To avoid assuming repeats, let's go with ""DUPER"".

Moreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.

So I'll guess ""DUPER"".

But let's confirm the pattern: D U P E R
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: U (new)
- Position 3: P (new)
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

If it's not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.

Alternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.

But I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.

So <guess>duper</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  
  - Absent letters: C, A, N.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): T, I.  
  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 3), D (not position 5).  
  - Correct position: E (position 4).  

- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - Correct positions: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Absent letters (add to previous): O, Z.  
  - **Secret word structure**: D _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, and 5 confirmed).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1: D  
  - Position 4: E  
  - Position 5: R  
- **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""D"" and ending with ""ER"".  
  - Letters for positions 2 and 3 must not be from the absent list.  
  - Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y (since C, A, N, T, I, O, Z are excluded).  
- **Possible words**:  
  - Common candidates: ""DUPER"" (D, U, P, E, R), ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R), ""DUMER"" (not valid), ""DIVER"" (invalid due to I), etc.  
  - ""DEWER"" has a repeated E (position 2 and 4), which is possible but less likely without prior evidence of duplicates.  
  - ""DUPER"" uses new letters (U, P) and fits the pattern without repeats, making it a strong candidate for testing.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most plausible word that fits the pattern and maximizes new information.  
- **Why ""DUPER""?**  
  - It includes U and P (new letters not tested before).  
  - It avoids absent letters and adheres to the D _ _ E R structure.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on U and P will help narrow down options (e.g., ""DEWER"" or other words).  
- **If ""DUPER"" is wrong**:  
  - Feedback will confirm if U or P are present/absent, reducing possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""DEWER"" or similar).

<guess>duper</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)
Guess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: duper -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the fourth guess ""duper"": D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- D is correct (position 1).
- U is absent from the secret word (x).
- P is absent from the secret word (x).
- E is correct (position 4).
- R is correct (position 5).

So, we can add U and P to the list of absent letters. The absent letters are now: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P.

The secret word is D _ _ E R.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.

The available letters for positions 2 and 3 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y (since the absent letters are excluded).

We must find a word of the form D X Y E R, where X and Y are from the available letters.

Common words that fit:
- ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R) — note that it has E in position 2, which would be a repeated E. But E is already at position 4, so if ""DEWER"" is the word, position 2 is E and position 3 is W.
- Other possibilities: 
  - ""DIVER"" — I is absent, so invalid.
  - ""DATER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DOBER"" — O is absent.
  - ""DAKER"" — A is absent.
  - ""DEMUR"" — but position 4 would have to be E, and ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, but U is absent and the pattern doesn't match because position 4 is U, not E.

Given U and P are now absent, ""DUPER"" is eliminated.

Now, for ""DEWER"": 
- Position 1: D (correct)
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: W
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (correct)

Is ""DEWER"" a valid word? Yes, it means one that dewes or a tawer.

Alternatively, are there other words?
- ""DYKER"" — D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""Diker"" is one who digs ditches? But spelling? Usually ""diker"" and it's acceptable? But let's see: positions 2: Y, 3: K. But we don't have evidence.
- ""DIMER"" — I absent.
- ""DAMER"" — A absent.
- ""DOWRY"" — not matching pattern, ends with Y.
- ""DOXED"" — not ending with R.

Given the constraints, ""DEWER"" seems a strong candidate because we've tested and eliminated many letters.

But note: in previous guesses, we have not tested W at all? So W could be present.

Moreover, we haven't tested E at position 2? In this word, E is repeated? Which is possible.

Another word: ""DWYER"" — proper noun? Not common.

Or ""DELER"" — not a word.

""DEVEL"" — not ending with R.

Given that, ""DEWER"" is the most plausible guess? But let's see if we can confirm.

But we have two attempts left? So we can guess ""DEWER"".

If not, another possibility is ""D (letter1) (letter2) E R"", with letter1 and letter2 being new? But few options.

After U and P are absent, the remaining letters? We can try B? F? G? Etc? But ""DEWER"" is a candidate? 

Wait, we should note: In the word ""DEWER"", position 2 is E? Which would be a repeat? But we haven't had feedback indicating an E elsewhere? However, it could be.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible 5-letter words matching D _ _ E R without using absent letters? 

If we don't allow E at position 2? Then what? We have no other common words? 

For example: ""D W E E R""? But that's not how words work.

Words: 
- With position 2: not E? Then possibilities: 
  - ""DAVER"" — A absent? 
  - ""DIVER"" — I absent? 
  - ""DOVES"" — O absent? And doesn't end with R?
  - ""DIMER"" — I absent?
  - ""DADES"" — A absent?

Actually, with the absent list, it seems ""DEWER"" is one of the few words that fit? 

Another: ""DEMEN"" — not ending with R.

I think ""DEWER"" is the best bet? But let's consider: In guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a '-'? Then in guess 2, E at position 4 was ✓. So if there was an E at position 2, it would not have been tested? So it's possible.

Moreover, in ""dozer"" and ""duper"", we didn't have E at position 2? So we didn't test it.

Therefore, I will guess ""DEWER"" as the fifth guess.

<guess>dewer</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback  
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  
  - **Absent**: C, A, N.  
  - **Present but misplaced**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  
- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  
  - **Absent (add)**: T, I.  
  - **Correct position**: E (position 4).  
  - **Misplaced**: D (not position 5).  
- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - **Absent (add)**: O, Z.  
- **Guess 4: ""duper"" → D(✓), U(❌), P(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  
  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5) (reaffirmed).  
  - **Absent (add)**: U, P.  
- **Summary**:  
  - **Secret word structure**: `D _ _ E R`.  
  - **Confirmed letters/positions**: D (1), E (4), R (5).  
  - **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P → **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y.  
  - **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  

### Deductions for Fifth Guess  
- The only valid English word fitting `D _ _ E R` with remaining letters is **""DEWER""** (D-E-W-E-R, meaning a person/thing that dewes or a tawer).  
  - Position 2 = E (possible repeat, given E is at position 4).  
  - Position 3 = W (available letter).  
- Why ""DEWER""?  
  - Tests E at position 2 (new position for E) and W (new letter).  
  - If correct, the word is solved. If incorrect, feedback on E/W presence/position refines possibilities.

But we also must not reuse the positions we know they are wrong.\n\n However, note: the feedback does not say that R cannot be in other positions? Actually, we only know that R is not in position2. Similarly, E is not in position5.\n\n So in the new guess, we can try R and E in new positions to see if we can find the correct ones.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R (but not in position2) and E (not in position5). Also, we must avoid C, A, N.\n\n What about ""ROGUE""? \n - R at position1 (avoided position2)\n - E at position5? But wait: we must not put E at position5 because we already know E is not at position5? Actually, we can put E at position5 again? It\'s allowed to guess again but it\'s inefficient because we know it\'s not there.\n\n However, note: we already know E is not in position5? Yes, so it\'s better to put E in one of the positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly, R should not be in position2? But note: R could be in position2? Wait no: feedback said R is present and in the secret word but not in position2? So that means the R in the secret word is at a different position? But the same letter? Actually, the secret word has at least one R, and it\'s not in position2? But it could be in another position? So putting R in position2 again would be inefficient? Actually, we already tried R in position2 and found it\'s not there? So lets avoid that?\n\n We can try:\n - R in position1,3,4, or5? But note: we have a constraint that E cannot be in position5? And R cannot be in position2? But also, we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? For R? Not position2? For E? Not position5?\n\n Now, if we put R at position1? Then E? At position3? Or position4? \n\n Some common words: \n Option: ""REFER"" -> repeats R? Not ideal.\n\n Option: ""OLDER"" -> contains O,L,D,E,R? But E is at position4? and R at position5? \n However, we must double-check: ""OLDER"" -> O, L, D, E, R. This avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n\n But wait: what about the first guess: we had R at position2 and it was marked present. But in ""OLDER"", R is at position5? That could be possible? Similarly, E is at position4? And we know E is in the word and not at position5? So position4 is acceptable.\n\n However, let\'s consider: the secret word might contain two R\'s? We don\'t know. It might contain two E\'s? Similarly? But to maximize information, we choose a word with new letters? And without duplicates? But ""OLDER"" has distinct letters? Actually no: only one letter? It has distinct? O, L, D, E, R? Yes distinct.\n\n But also, we know from first guess that the word contains E? And R? So ""OLDER"" has both? Also, we are testing O, L, D? which are new? \n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""ROUTE"" -> R (position1), O (2), U (3), T (4), E (5)? But E at position5? We already know E is not at position5? So we shouldn\'t. \n\n How about ""TIRED"": T, I, R, E, D? \n - R at position3? (not position2) -> okay\n - E at position4? (not position5) -> okay\n - We avoid C, A, N? Yes? Letters T,I,R,E,D? None of the forbidden.\n\n Another: ""CREME"" -> contains C? We know C is absent? So invalid? Also, not 5 distinct.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TIRED"": \n Why ""TIRED""? It tests:\n - T at position1? \n - I at position2? \n - R at position3? \n - E at position4? \n - D at position5?\n\n We avoid the forbidden letters? Yes? T, I, R, E, D?

The secret word contains: R, E, D.\n   - E is in position 4 (since it was correct in guess 2 at position 4).\n   - R is present but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2).\n   - D is present but not in position 5 (from guess 2).\n2. Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I. So we must avoid these letters.\n3. Known positions:\n   - Position 4 is E.\n\nNow, let\'s recall positions:\n   Position 1: ? (cannot be C, A, N, T, I)\n   Position 2: ? (cannot be R? But we only know that R is not in pos 2 and 3, but we can have R in other positions? However, note position 1 and 5 are possible for R.)\n   Position 3: ? \n   Position 4: E (fixed)\n   Position 5: ? (cannot be E? Actually from first guess we know E is not in position 5? Correct? But now we have E at position 4? So position 5 is open for others? But we also know D is not in position 5? And D must be elsewhere.)\n\nAlso, note: D is in the word? And not in position 5? So D must be in one of positions 1,2,3? Because position 4 is E? So D must be in position 1,2, or 3? Similarly, R must be in position 1,4, or 5? But position 4 is E, so R cannot be there? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And we know R is not in position 2 and 3? So positions left for R: 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, D must be in position 1,2, or 3? But we know D is in the word? And not in position 5? So yes.\n\nSo we have two cases for R: at position 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, the word has five letters: three known (R, E, D) and two unknown? Wait: we have at least R, E, D? But maybe more? We only have three confirmed? And we have two more positions? But the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? So the word has 5 letters? We know three? And two more? With letters from remaining alphabet? Avoiding C, A, N, T, I.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible letters? But we don\'t know? We can consider.\n\nWe also know that D is in position 1,2, or 3? And R is in position 1 or 5? But note: if R is at position 1, then D cannot be at position 1? And if R is at position 5, then D is at 1,2,3? \n\nAlso, note we have to form a valid English word.\n\nGiven we need to make a third guess? We want to maximize the information? And try to resolve the positions of R and D.\n\nBut note: if we put R in position 5? Then we can test positions? Or put D in a new position? Etc?\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that covers more possibilities? \n\nWe know:\n- Position 4 is E? Fixed.\n- The word must have R, D, and E? And two more letters? At least three known? Then two unknown? So five total? So two unknown letters? Or might there be D repeated? Or R repeated? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the first guess? ""crane"" had R at position 2? And we got (-) meaning R was present? And then second guess? ""tired"" had R at position3? And again (-)? Which means it\'s still not the right position? So R must be either position1 or 5? As we said.\n\nSimilarly, D? In ""tired"" we placed D at position5? Got (-)? So it\'s in the word? But not position5? So must be positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we know from feedback that position 1 in first guess ""crane"" had C? Absent? So position1 cannot be C? Similarly, position1 in second guess ""tired"" had T? Absent? So position1 cannot be T? Similarly, we can list known absent per position? But actually? We know the letters are absent entirely? So they cannot appear anywhere? So we don\'t have to worry per position? Because if a letter is absent? It cannot be in any position? So we must avoid C,A,N,T,I? So the available letters? Are all letters? Except these? And avoiding previous ones? \n\nMoreover? We know position1? Cannot be the absent letters? And also? Cannot be? Because? Well? The word must not contain? So the set of forbidden letters? { C, A, N, T, I }? Must not be used.\n\nAvailable letters: ? But there are many? But we have constraints: the word has E at position4? And must include R and D? With R at position1 or 5? And D at position1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the two other positions? Position 2 and 3? Or? Depending? If position1 is taken by R? Then positions 2 and 3? Must be? Two letters? Then position5? Must be a letter? Since R is either at position1 or 5? We have two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: R at position1 -> then the word structure: R _ _ E _\n- Position 5? Must be a letter? Not E? And not R? Because? R is only one? But we don\'t know? Possibly? But to save? Only known letters? We know the word must have D? And D must be in positions 2 or 3? Because if position1 is R? Then D cannot be at position1? So positions 2 or 3? And then position5 is free? Must be a letter that is not forbidden? And also? we need position3? Might be? Or? Wait? There are positions: 1=R, 2=?, 3=?, 4=E, 5=?\n- Conditions: D must be in the word? So either position2 or position3? And the other one? Position2? And position3? And position5? Are filled by other letters? Not forbidden? And not known letters? We only know R, D, E? So two more letters? And D is one? So? The word is R (position1), E (position4), D (at position2 or 3)? And then position5 is one letter? Position3 (if D is at 2) or position2 (if D is at 3)? Also? And one more? So? Five letters? So? We need two more letters? For positions 2 and 3? Or whichever? Actually? Words have five letters? So:\n\nStructure for R at position1: \n- Position 1: R\n- Position 2: ? (must be not forbidden? and not E? because E at4? and E cannot be here? unless repeated? But we don\'t know? But E is already at4? And if we have E repeated? Then position2 could be E? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? And got ""-"", meaning E is present? But not at5? So it could be at other positions? But now? Position5? We don\'t know? But? In this scenario? Position2? Could be E? But if it is? Then E would be at2 and4? Then feedback may have shown both? But we don\'t have? So? Generally? We don\'t know if E repeats? Similarly? We don\'t know if R repeats? But the second letter? Position2? We can choose freely? But we must have D in the word? So D must be in position2 or 3? Or? If D is at position5? Wait no? From feedback? D must be in positions 1,2,3? Because we tried D at position5 and got wrong position? So D must be in 1,2,3? But position1? If R? Then cannot be? So position2 or3? So? Therefore? For words with R at1: we must have D at position2 or3? And position5? Must be a letter? Not forbidden? Not D? Not E? Wait? Could be? But? To form a word? We need valid choices that are English words.\n\nScenario 2: R at position5? Then? The word structure: _ _ _ E R\n- Then? Position1: ?\n- Position2: ?\n- Position3: ?\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: R\n- D must be in position1,2, or 3? (since not position5? And positions 1,2,3 are available? Because position5 is R? And position4 is E? So D must be at 1,2,3? And the other positions? One of 1,2,3? And the remaining two? Are other letters? Not forbidden? And including D as well.\n\nAgain? We need a letter? But? We don\'t know? So? How can we resolve?\n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that places R at either position1 or5? And D? At position1? For example? Or at position2 or3? To test? \n\nBut let me form concrete words.\n\nFirst? For scenario 1: R at position1? And D at position2? Then? Word: R D ? E ? \nExample words: \n- ""RIDER"": R, D, I? But I is forbidden? \n- ""RODEO"": R, O, D, E, O? But O? Not forbidden? But wait? Also? D in position3? Then position5 O? O is not forbidden? So ""RODEO""? Or ""rodeo"" is a valid word? But note? The word must have no forbidden letters? ""RODEO"" contains O? which is not forbidden? So possible? But also? We need to check? Also? Feedback? We placed D at position5? But we are told D is not at5? And we already tried? So? In ""RODEO""? D is at position3? So position3=D? That\'s allowed? Since D wasn\'t placed at5. So? But wait? ""RODEO"" is commonly spelled? And 5 letters.\n\nSimilarly? Other possibilities? R at1? D at3? Then? R ? D E ? -> R+D at position3? Example: ""ruder""? But R at1? U at2? D at3? E at4? R at5? But we have R at5? Then R is at position1 and5? Then the word has two R\'s? That\'s possible? But in ""ruder""? We have R,U,D,E,R? Then position5 R? So? \n\nBut wait? In our scenario? If R is at position1? Then for scenario1? R is only at1? In scenario2? R at5? So? If we choose a word with R at5? Then R cannot be at1? And if we choose R at1? then cannot be at5? Unless? Actually? We don\'t know? But? In second guess? We placed R at position3? Which is wrong? And we got feedback that R is present? But not position3? So? How many R? We don\'t know? It could be? If R is in two positions? Then we must have? But? The feedback? Only tells us? When we guess? The marks are per letter? But? If the secret has repeated? Then? We might get multiple? \n\nBut? We cannot assume? So? To be safe? We can try a word without repetition? To simplify? \n\nLet\'s consider words that fit both scenarios? But more importantly? We want to test the position of D? Because we know D must be at positions 1,2, or 3? And we haven\'t tested position1 or2 for D? Only position5? Which was wrong? But we tested position3? We didn\'t place D at position3? In ""tired""? D was at position5? Only? So? We don\'t know about positions 1,2,3? So? We can test D at position1? For example?\n\nWe can form a word? With D at position1? Then? Consider:\n\nOption: ""DWORD""? Not a word? \n\nOption: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E? But I is forbidden? And E at position5? But we have E at position4? Here? Position4 is V? But we must have position4=E? So? Cannot? \n\nWe must have position4=E? So? If D at position1? Then? D ? ? E ? \nAlso? Must have R? Either at? Position5? Or? position2? But if D at1? And position4=E? Then? R could be at position5? Or position2? Or position3? But we haven\'t ruled out position2? Actually? Previously? We know R cannot be at position2? Because in ""crane""? R was at position2? And got (-)? So R is present? But not in position2? So? D at position1? Then R must be at position3 or position5? Because position4=E? And position2? Cannot be R? So?\n- Position1: D\n- Position2: must not be R? So? A letter? Not forbidden?\n- Position3: ? (could be R)\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: ? (could be R)\n\nBut? In this? We have D? So that covers D? And R could be at position3? Or position5?\n\nNow? We also know? We need the word to have? At least? We have D? E? and R? So? The secret word? So? The word we guess? Must have D? E? R? And two more letters? That are not forbidden? So? For ""D _ _ E ?"" with a letter at position2? and position? And R either at position3 or5? \n\nWhat English words? Start with D? Then? E at4? Then? For example? \n- ""DROVE"": D,R,O,V,E? Then O and V? \n  - Now? Positions: D at1? R at2? O at3? V at? Position5? E at4? Actually? But position4=E? So? We have: \n    Position1: D\n    Position2: R? But wait? Here R is at position2? But we know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position2? And it was (-)? Meaning present but wrong position? So if R is at position2? Then? Why? The secret could have R at position2? But? Then? The feedback would have been (✓) for R? Or? Actually? The secret has? Could it have two R\'s? And one at another position? But? The feedback? Only marks? Per position? But? If the secret has R at position2? Then? When we guessed R at position2? Then it should be marked (✓) not (-)? To clarify: the feedback symbol per letter: \n    ✓: correct letter and correct position\n    -: letter exists? But wrong position\n    x: letter does not exist\n\n    Therefore? For ""crane"" at position2? R got -? Meaning? The secret word has at least one R? But it is not at position2? But it could be at another position? So R could be elsewhere? But? If the secret word had R at position2? Then it should be ✓? So? Therefore? R is not at position2? So? We can not put R at position2? In any guess? And similarly? R cannot be at position3? Because we tried at position3 and got \'-\'? Which means it\'s present? But not there? \n\n    Therefore? In the word with D at position1? We cannot put R at position2? Because already ruled out? Similarly? Position3 is also ruled out? So? The only possibility for R is position5? \n\n    Then? Structure: D _ _ E R\n    And we have position2 and position3? Must be two letters? Not forbidden? Including? One letter? Because we have D? E? R? And we need two more? Or? And? Also? We must have? Since we only know? Actually? The word must be? Valid.\n\n    Example: ""DINER"": D,I,N,E,R? But I and N are forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n    Another: ""DOZER"": D,O,Z,E,R? \n    Letters: O? Z? Are they forbidden? No? Only forbidden are C,A,N,T,I? So O and Z are allowed.\n\n    So? ""DOZER"" is a candidate? Then? Position1=D? which is allowed? Since D must be in the word? And position5=R? And position4=E? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=Z? \n\n    But? Does it contain R? Yes? At position5? We know R must be present? And E at4? \n\n    Alternatively? Other words? Like ""DATER""? But A is forbidden? Or ""DUVET""? But E at position4? So? D,U,V,E? Then? Position5? Must be R? So? ""DUVER"" is not English? \n\n    So ""DOZER"" is a possible word? \n\n    But? Also? From Scenario 2? We have the possibility that R is at position5? So? ""DOZER"" fits that? \n\n    But? What about Scenario 1? When R is at position1? Then? How? We need D at position2 or3? So? We might also consider words with R at1? And D at2? \n\n    What word? R at position1? D at position2? Position4=E? Then structure: R D ? E ? \n    Position3: a letter? And position5: a letter? \n    Example: ""RUDER"" -> R,U,D,E,R? But R at5? Then we have two R\'s? And also? U and D? \n    Position3? D? But position2? D? So? ""RUDER"": \n    Position1: R\n    Position2: U? \n    Position3: D? \n    Position4: E? \n    Position5: R? \n\n    Words? Like ""ruder"" not very common? But? Valid? Or ""RIDER"": R,I,D,E,R? But forbidden letter I? \n\n    Better? ""RADAR"" -> forbidden A? \n\n    Another: ""RIVER"": R,I,V,E,R? forbidden I? \n\n    Another: ""ROVER"": R,O,V,E,R? \n    Has O? allowed? So ""ROVER"" -> R,O,V,E,R? \n    But? We have E at position4? Correct? Position2=O? Position3=V? Position5=R? \n    So? This word has R at position1 and position5? So R is repeated.\n\n    Now? Considering that the secret word? Contains R? But could have multiple? \n\n    But? Which case? We don\'t know? So? We want to test? Possibly with one word? \n\n    However? Note? In ""DOZER"": \n    - We have D at position1? and R at position5? \n    Also? O at2? and Z at3? \n\n    In ""ROVER"": \n    - R at1? O at2? V at3? E at4? R at5? \n\n    We want to choose one? That narrows down? \n\n    Alternatively? We can try a word that has R at position5? And D at position2? For example? To cover both? But? \n\n    Wait? We need to use the information? We know D must be in one of 1,2,3? So? If we put D at position1? Then? As in ""DOZER""? \n\n    But? If the secret word has R at position1? And D at position3? Then? We wouldn\'t capture? We need a word that addresses the possibilities.\n\n    However? Note? We have only two remaining possibilities for R: position1 or position5? So? We can design a guess? That places R at position5? And also tests? As many other letters as possible? \n\n    Why position5? Because if we put R at position5? And D at? Let\'s say position2? Then? If R is not at5? Then this guess will not have R at1? Then? We\'ll know it must be at1? And similarly? If D is not where we place? Then we\'ll know?\n\n    But let\'s design a word? \n\n    Option: Put D at position2? And R at position5? \n    Then? Structure: ? D ? E R \n    Must avoid previous absent letters? So? The first position? Cannot be C,A,N,T,I? Or forbidden? And position3? \n    Letters: \n      Position1: any letter except C,A,N,T,I? And except D? And E? but E at4? So? \n      Position3: any letter? \n    Example word: ""UDDER"" -> U,D,D,E,R? But repeats D? And ""udder"" has D repeated? Why not? \n    But letters: U? D? D? E? R? So? Position1: U? \n    But? Valid word? Yes? ""udder"". \n    Also? ""ODDER""? Not common? \n    Other: ""ADDER""? But A forbidden? \n\n    ""udder"" is valid? \n\n    Alternatively? Without repeat: ""ORDER"": O,R,D,E,R? \n    R at position2? But? We know R cannot be at position2? Because first guess? So? Position2? Cannot be R? \n    If we put ""ORDER"": \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: R? But! We know R cannot be at position2? So? Bad? \n\n    So? ""udder"": \n      Position1: U? \n      Position2: D? \n      Position3: D? (repeated D? which might be allowed? \n      But? Then? Feedback for D? If D is repeated? Then? It will mark? At position2? And position3? Etc?\n\n    Since D is position2? And if the secret has D at position2? Then it\'s ✓? Else? It\'s -? Or? Depending? \n\n    But? Maybe we choose a word without repeats? \n\n    Another word: ""IDLER""? \n      But I? forbidden? \n\n    ""ADORE"": A forbidden? \n\n    ""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R? Then? \n      Position1: O? \n      Position2: F? \n      Position3: F? \n      Position4: E? \n      Position5: R? \n    So? But? Does it have D? No? D is not included? But we know D must be in the secret word? So? Our guess must include D? Because we are trying to confirm positions? Or? Alternatively? But? We know D is in the secret? So? If we don\'t guess D? Then we might miss? \n\n    Actually? We don\'t have to guess D? But? Then? If the word is ""OFFER""? And we guess? Then feedback? \n    Position4: E is ✓? \n    Position5: R will show ✓? Then O? F? F? \n    But? Then? We know that D is present? But how do we know? We haven\'t guessed? We can infer? But? We are allowed to guess words without all the known letters? But? It might be inefficient? Because? We already know D is present? So? We should try to include D? To get feedback on its position? \n\n    So? Our guess should include R (if we want to test its position? But we know if R is at5? Or not? But? Also D? To test D\'s position? \n\n    Therefore? We need? \n    - To include R and E? But E is known at position4? \n    - To include D? \n    - To avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\n    Also? Since R? We want to put it at position5? To test if it\'s there? Or? Alternatively? Position1? \n\n    Why not choose? ""DOZER""? \n    - D at position1? \n    - O at position2? \n    - Z at position3? \n    - E at position4? \n    - R at position5? \n    This includes D? R? E? \n    Moreover? Position of D is position1? To test? It covers? \n    Also? Position of R is position5? \n\n    Alternatively? If R is actually at position1? Then? This guess will show? R at5? Will get an \'x\'? But wait? R is present? So we have R? At one position? So if the secret has R at position1? Then? At position5? It might be wrong? But? The R at position5? Will show \'-\'? Because R exists? But not at position5? \n    Then? We know R must be at position1? \n\n    And? D at position1? Let feedback tell us? \n\n    Also? O and Z? Are new letters? \n\n    So? ""DOZER""? Seem a good guess? \n\n    But also? Another common option? ""PRIZE""? But? Doesn\'t contain D? And? Not? So? No? \n\n    Therefore? I choose ""DOZER"" \n\n<guess>dozer</guess> \n\nFeedback will tell us?### Reasoning Step by Step\n\nWe have two rounds of feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: C, A, N.\n   - **Letters PRESENT but in wrong position**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).\n   - **Position constraints**: R cannot be at position 2; E cannot be at position 5.\n\n2. **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**\n   - **Letters NOT in the secret word (absent)**: T, I (added to previous absent: now C, A, N, T, I).\n   - **Letters PRESENT but wrong position**: R (in ""tired,"" R was at position 3, so R is not at position 3 or 2), D (in ""tired,"" D was at position 5, so D is present but not at position 5).\n   - **Correct position**: E is confirmed at position 4 (since it got ✓).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Secret word contains**: R, E, D.\n- **Known letters positions**:\n  - E must be at **position 4** (fixed).\n  - R cannot be at position 2 or 3 → possible positions for R: 1 or 5.\n  - D cannot be at position 5 → possible positions for D: 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Absent letters (excluded)**: C, A, N, T, I. Any guess must avoid these letters.\n- **Unknown positions**:  \n  - Position 1: Must be R (only option left?) or a new letter?  \n  - Position 2: Must be a new letter or D?  \n  - Position 3: Must be a new letter or D?  \n  - Position 5: Must be R (if not at position 1) or a new letter?\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Must include**: D (to test its position) and R (to confirm position 1 or 5).\n- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 must be E.\n- **Avoid**: C, A, N, T, I.\n- **Goal**: Resolve R and D positions:\n  - If R is in position 1, D must be in position 2 or 3.\n  - If R is in position 5, D must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- **Approach**: Choose a word with R at position 5 (to test that theory) and D at position 1 (to test D alignment), while using common letters to cover new ground.\n\n### Why ""dozer""?\n- 📌 **Positions**:  \n  - Position 1: D → Tests D at start (possible but not position 5 per prior feedback).  \n  - Position 2: O → Common vowel, not in absent list.  \n  - Position 3: Z → Less common, but tests new letter.  \n  - Position 4: E → Fixed.  \n  - Position 5: R → Tests R at end (possible).  \n- 💡 **Covers**: Includes D, R, and E. Tests R at position 5 and D at position 1.  \n- ⚠️ **Avoids**: C, A, N, T, I (all absent letters).  \n- ℹ️ **Maximizes information**: Uses new letters (O, Z) to probe for presence/absence.  \n- ✅ **English word**: Valid (e.g., ""dozer"" means a power shovel or someone who sleeps).\n\nIf R is position 1, feedback will show R at position 5 as ""-"" (wrong position) but confirm D at 1. If R is position 5, it may be ""✓"", speeding up resolution.\n\n<guess>dozer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the third guess ""dozer"": D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- D is correct and in the correct position (position 1).\n- O is not in the word at all (x).\n- Z is not in the word at all (x).\n- E is correct and in the correct position (position 4) — we already knew this.\n- R is correct and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n- The letters O and Z are absent, so we add them to the absent list.\n\nNow, the absent letters are: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.\n\nWe know the word must be of the form: D _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill in positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.\n\nWe also know from previous feedback that the word contains R (which we have at position 5) and E (at position 4), and D (at position 1). There might be other letters, but we have two positions to fill.\n\nWe must consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we don\'t have evidence of that yet.\n\nPossible letters for positions 2 and 3: any letter except the absent ones (C, A, N, T, I, O, Z) and also excluding D, E, R? Not necessarily, because they could repeat? But we don\'t know. However, since we have D, E, R already placed, and no feedback indicated duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now, but it\'s safer to consider the possibility.\n\nBut let\'s first list common letters that can appear: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y.\n\nWe need a word that starts with D, ends with ER, and has a letter in position 2 and 3.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""DINER"" -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I(x)), so invalid.\n- ""DIVER"" -> V is allowed? V is not in absent list. D, I, V, E, R -> but I is absent, so invalid.\n- ""DOPER"" -> O is absent, invalid.\n- ""DATER"" -> A is absent, invalid.\n- ""DUTER"" -> not a word? \n- ""DOVER"" -> O is absent? O is now absent, so invalid.\n- ""DICER"" -> I and C absent, invalid.\n\nLet\'s think of words with D _ _ E R.\n\nOptions:\n- ""DULER"" -> not a word.\n- ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R -> but position 4 is E, so it would be D, ?, ?, E, R. In ""DEMUR"", it\'s D-E-M-U-R, so position 2 is E? But we have position 4 as E. So that would be two E\'s? But we don\'t know if E is repeated. However, in ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E, but we have E at position 4. So the word would be D, E, M, U, R. But we need position 4 to be E, which it is, and position 2 is E. So that could be possible? But we have to check if E can be repeated.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at 5. Then in the second guess, E at position 4 was correct. If there is another E, we might have gotten feedback about it? But in ""tired"", we only had one E at position 4, and it was correct. We didn\'t test position 2 for E. So it\'s possible that E is at position 2 as well? But we don\'t have evidence against it.\n\nSimilarly, in ""dozer"", we had E at position 4 correct and no other E, so we didn\'t get feedback about other positions.\n\nSo ""DEMUR"" is a candidate? But ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, so:\nPosition 1: D (correct)\nPosition 2: E (would be a new position for E, but we know E is at position 4, so if there is another E, it might be allowed? But the feedback hasn\'t shown an E in position 2? We haven\'t tested it.\n\nBut let\'s see the structure: we need position 2 and 3 to be filled. In ""DEMUR"", position 2 is E and position 3 is M. But we have E at position 4, so if the secret word has two E\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we must consider the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at 5. It didn\'t say anything about position 2. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we also have to check if M and U are allowed? They are not in the absent list.\n\nAnother common word: ""DIMER"" -> I is absent, invalid.\n\n""DEUCE"" -> but doesn\'t end with R? And has E at position 2? But we need ...E R at the end.\n\nWe need the last two letters to be E and R, so the word must end with ""ER"".\n\nSo words like: D _ _ E R\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n- ""DIVER"" -> I absent, invalid.\n- ""DOPER"" -> O absent, invalid.\n- ""DATER"" -> A absent, invalid.\n- ""DUTER"" -> not a word.\n- ""DOWER"" -> O absent, invalid.\n- ""DAKER"" -> A absent, invalid.\n- ""DEWER"" -> E at position 2? And W? D, E, W, E, R? But position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So ""DEWER"" is a word (one who taws skins). Letters: D, E, W, E, R. So two E\'s? And W is allowed.\n\nBut we have E at position 2 and position 4. Is that possible? Yes, if the word has two E\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEMUR"" as above.\n\nBut ""DEWER"" has E at position 2? And we haven\'t tested that.\n\nAnother: ""DICER"" -> I and C absent.\n\n""DUVET"" -> doesn\'t end with R.\n\nPerhaps ""DUPER"" -> U and P? But O? No, ""DUPER"" is D,U,P,E,R. So position 2: U, position 3: P. And U and P are allowed? Yes.\n\nSo ""DUPER"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUMER"" -> not common.\n\n""DAZER"" -> A and Z absent, invalid.\n\n""DOZER"" we already tried, and O and Z are absent.\n\nAnother: ""DECKER"" -> too long? 6 letters? No, 5 letters: D,E,C,K,E,R? Wait, that\'s 6? D-E-C-K-E-R? 6 letters. Not 5.\n\n5-letter words: D _ _ E R\n\nLet\'s think:\n- ""DINER"" invalid (I)\n- ""DIVER"" invalid (I)\n- ""DOPER"" invalid (O)\n- ""DATER"" invalid (A)\n- ""DUTER"" not word\n- ""DOWER"" invalid (O)\n- ""DAKER"" invalid (A)\n- ""DEWER"" - possible? D, E, W, E, R? But that\'s 5 letters: positions 1:D, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But position 4 is E, which is correct, and position 5 is R, correct. But position 2 is E? So if the secret word has E at position 2 and 4, it\'s possible.\n\nBut we need to check if E can be at position 2. We have no feedback against E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEMUR"": D, E, M, U, R? But that\'s D-E-M-U-R, so position 4 is U? But we need position 4 to be E. So that doesn\'t work. ""DEMUR"" has E at position 2, M at 3, U at 4, R at 5. But we need position 4 to be E, so U at position 4 is wrong. So ""DEMUR"" does not fit the pattern D _ _ E R; it is D E M U R, which is D _ _ _ R with E at 2 and U at 4, not E at 4.\n\nI think I confused myself.\n\nThe pattern is: position 1: D, position 2: ?, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nSo the word must be: D ? ? E R\n\nIn ""DEMUR"", it is D E M U R, so:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: U\n- Position 5: R\n\nBut we need position 4 to be E, but in ""DEMUR"" position 4 is U, not E. So it doesn\'t match.\n\nSimilarly, ""DEWER"" is D E W E R, so:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: W\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n\nThis matches the pattern: D, E, W, E, R. So position 2 is E, position 3 is W, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.\n\nNow, is ""DEWER"" a valid word? It means a person or thing that dews, or a tawer. It\'s in the word list.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"": D U P E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. So that matches.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""DICER"" invalid\n- ""DIMER"" invalid\n- ""DIVER"" invalid\n- ""DOPER"" invalid\n- ""DATER"" invalid\n- ""DOWER"" invalid\n- ""DAKER"" invalid\n- ""DUTER"" not word\n- ""DYKER"" -> D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""DYKER"" might be a variant of ""dyke"", but let\'s see if it\'s accepted. Not common.\n- ""DUMER"" not word\n- ""DUNER"" not word\n- ""DURER"" -> D,U,R,E,R? But R at position 3 and 5? So D, U, R, E, R. Position 3 is R? But we have R at position 5, so if there is another R, it\'s possible. But position 3 is R, and we know R cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2: R at position 3 was marked \'-\', so R is not at position 3). Therefore, ""DURER"" has R at position 3, which is invalid because we know R is not at position 3. So it cannot be.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"" is valid: D, U, P, E, R.\n\n""DEWER"" is valid: D, E, W, E, R.\n\nAlso, ""DETER"": D, E, T, E, R? But T is absent (from guess 2: T(x)), so invalid.\n\n""DELVER"": too long? D,E,L,V,E,R? 6 letters.\n\n""DEMON"": doesn\'t end with R.\n\nSo possible words: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"", and perhaps others.\n\n""DUKER"" not word.\n\n""DOBER"" not word.\n\n""DEVER"" not word.\n\n""DAWER"" A absent.\n\nSo likely candidates: ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""DIVER"" but I is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DIXER"" X? But I absent.\n\n""DUXES"" not ending with R.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DEWER"" and ""DUPER"".\n\nIn ""DEWER"", we have E at position 2. We haven\'t tested E at position 2 before. In the first guess, E was at position 5, not 2. In second guess, E at position 4. In third guess, no E at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DUPER"", we have U and P, which are new.\n\nWe want to maximize information. If we guess ""DEWER"", and if E is not at position 2, then we know it\'s not, and we can eliminate. But if it is, we get more information.\n\nBut we have only two candidates? So we can guess one.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 4, we can guess one of them.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""DEWER"", and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know it must be ""DUPER"" or another word? But we have to see.\n\nAre there more words? Let\'s think of ""DULER"" not word.\n\n""DUVET"" not ending with R.\n\n""DUMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUSTER"" too long.\n\n5-letter words: D _ _ E R\n\nWith the missing letters not in absent list.\n\nLetters for position 2: not C,A,N,T,I,O,Z, and not D? But D is at position 1, so it can be repeated? But we don\'t know. Similarly for E and R.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s assume no repeats for now, but we have to consider.\n\nIf no repeats, then position 2 cannot be D, E, R. Similarly, position 3 cannot be D, E, R? But R is at position 5, so if no repeat, position 3 cannot be R. But we already know R cannot be at position 3.\n\nSo for position 2: any letter except absent and except D,E,R? But E and R are at other positions, so if no repeat, position 2 cannot be E or R or D.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: cannot be D, E, R.\n\nSo available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y.\n\nBut Q and X are less common.\n\nNow, words: D ? ? E R, with ? not D,E,R and not absent.\n\nFor example, ""DUPER"": U and P, both not D,E,R and not absent.\n\n""DEWER"": has E at position 2, which would be a repeat of E, so if we allow repeats, it\'s possible.\n\nBut if we don\'t allow repeats, then ""DEWER"" is invalid because E is repeated.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUPER"" has no repeats: D,U,P,E,R all distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""DAMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUMPER"" too long.\n\n""DUKER"" not word.\n\n""DIKER"" I absent.\n\n""DAKER"" A absent.\n\n""DUXES"" not ending with R.\n\n""DOZER"" already tried.\n\nSo perhaps ""DUPER"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""DICER"" invalid.\n\n""DISME"" not ending with R.\n\n""DOUSE"" not ending with R.\n\n""DELVE"" not ending with R.\n\n""DEMOB"" not ending with R.\n\nPerhaps ""DIVER"" is the only common one, but I is absent.\n\nI think ""DUPER"" is a valid choice.\n\n""DEWER"" is also valid but has repeated E.\n\nTo avoid assuming repeats, let\'s go with ""DUPER"".\n\nMoreover, in ""DUPER"", we test U and P, which are new.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""DUPER"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: D U P E R\n- Position 1: D (correct)\n- Position 2: U (new)\n- Position 3: P (new)\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R (correct)\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we can try ""DEWER"" next.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more efficient, we can consider that in ""dozer"" we had O and Z absent, so we have more information.\n\nBut I think ""DUPER"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo <guess>duper</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  \n  - Absent letters: C, A, N.  \n  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  \n  - Absent letters (add to previous): T, I.  \n  - Present but wrong position: R (not position 3), D (not position 5).  \n  - Correct position: E (position 4).  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  \n  - Correct positions: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  \n  - Absent letters (add to previous): O, Z.  \n  - **Secret word structure**: D _ _ E R (positions 1, 4, and 5 confirmed).  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  \n  - Position 1: D  \n  - Position 4: E  \n  - Position 5: R  \n- **Absent letters (cannot appear)**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z.  \n- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n- **Constraints**:  \n  - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""D"" and ending with ""ER"".  \n  - Letters for positions 2 and 3 must not be from the absent list.  \n  - Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y (since C, A, N, T, I, O, Z are excluded).  \n- **Possible words**:  \n  - Common candidates: ""DUPER"" (D, U, P, E, R), ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R), ""DUMER"" (not valid), ""DIVER"" (invalid due to I), etc.  \n  - ""DEWER"" has a repeated E (position 2 and 4), which is possible but less likely without prior evidence of duplicates.  \n  - ""DUPER"" uses new letters (U, P) and fits the pattern without repeats, making it a strong candidate for testing.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- **Goal**: Test the most plausible word that fits the pattern and maximizes new information.  \n- **Why ""DUPER""?**  \n  - It includes U and P (new letters not tested before).  \n  - It avoids absent letters and adheres to the D _ _ E R structure.  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on U and P will help narrow down options (e.g., ""DEWER"" or other words).  \n- **If ""DUPER"" is wrong**:  \n  - Feedback will confirm if U or P are present/absent, reducing possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""DEWER"" or similar).\n\n<guess>duper</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: dozer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) O(x) Z(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: duper -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the fourth guess ""duper"": D(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- D is correct (position 1).\n- U is absent from the secret word (x).\n- P is absent from the secret word (x).\n- E is correct (position 4).\n- R is correct (position 5).\n\nSo, we can add U and P to the list of absent letters. The absent letters are now: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P.\n\nThe secret word is D _ _ E R.\n\nWe need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that are not in the absent list and form a valid English word.\n\nThe available letters for positions 2 and 3 are: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y (since the absent letters are excluded).\n\nWe must find a word of the form D X Y E R, where X and Y are from the available letters.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- ""DEWER"" (D, E, W, E, R) — note that it has E in position 2, which would be a repeated E. But E is already at position 4, so if ""DEWER"" is the word, position 2 is E and position 3 is W.\n- Other possibilities: \n  - ""DIVER"" — I is absent, so invalid.\n  - ""DATER"" — A is absent.\n  - ""DOBER"" — O is absent.\n  - ""DAKER"" — A is absent.\n  - ""DEMUR"" — but position 4 would have to be E, and ""DEMUR"" is D-E-M-U-R, but U is absent and the pattern doesn\'t match because position 4 is U, not E.\n\nGiven U and P are now absent, ""DUPER"" is eliminated.\n\nNow, for ""DEWER"": \n- Position 1: D (correct)\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: W\n- Position 4: E (correct)\n- Position 5: R (correct)\n\nIs ""DEWER"" a valid word? Yes, it means one that dewes or a tawer.\n\nAlternatively, are there other words?\n- ""DYKER"" — D,Y,K,E,R? Y and K are allowed? ""Diker"" is one who digs ditches? But spelling? Usually ""diker"" and it\'s acceptable? But let\'s see: positions 2: Y, 3: K. But we don\'t have evidence.\n- ""DIMER"" — I absent.\n- ""DAMER"" — A absent.\n- ""DOWRY"" — not matching pattern, ends with Y.\n- ""DOXED"" — not ending with R.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""DEWER"" seems a strong candidate because we\'ve tested and eliminated many letters.\n\nBut note: in previous guesses, we have not tested W at all? So W could be present.\n\nMoreover, we haven\'t tested E at position 2? In this word, E is repeated? Which is possible.\n\nAnother word: ""DWYER"" — proper noun? Not common.\n\nOr ""DELER"" — not a word.\n\n""DEVEL"" — not ending with R.\n\nGiven that, ""DEWER"" is the most plausible guess? But let\'s see if we can confirm.\n\nBut we have two attempts left? So we can guess ""DEWER"".\n\nIf not, another possibility is ""D (letter1) (letter2) E R"", with letter1 and letter2 being new? But few options.\n\nAfter U and P are absent, the remaining letters? We can try B? F? G? Etc? But ""DEWER"" is a candidate? \n\nWait, we should note: In the word ""DEWER"", position 2 is E? Which would be a repeat? But we haven\'t had feedback indicating an E elsewhere? However, it could be.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s list all possible 5-letter words matching D _ _ E R without using absent letters? \n\nIf we don\'t allow E at position 2? Then what? We have no other common words? \n\nFor example: ""D W E E R""? But that\'s not how words work.\n\nWords: \n- With position 2: not E? Then possibilities: \n  - ""DAVER"" — A absent? \n  - ""DIVER"" — I absent? \n  - ""DOVES"" — O absent? And doesn\'t end with R?\n  - ""DIMER"" — I absent?\n  - ""DADES"" — A absent?\n\nActually, with the absent list, it seems ""DEWER"" is one of the few words that fit? \n\nAnother: ""DEMEN"" — not ending with R.\n\nI think ""DEWER"" is the best bet? But let\'s consider: In guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a \'-\'? Then in guess 2, E at position 4 was ✓. So if there was an E at position 2, it would not have been tested? So it\'s possible.\n\nMoreover, in ""dozer"" and ""duper"", we didn\'t have E at position 2? So we didn\'t test it.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""DEWER"" as the fifth guess.\n\n<guess>dewer</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback  \n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(❌), R(➖), A(❌), N(❌), E(➖)**  \n  - **Absent**: C, A, N.  \n  - **Present but misplaced**: R (not position 2), E (not position 5).  \n- **Guess 2: ""tired"" → T(❌), I(❌), R(➖), E(✓), D(➖)**  \n  - **Absent (add)**: T, I.  \n  - **Correct position**: E (position 4).  \n  - **Misplaced**: D (not position 5).  \n- **Guess 3: ""dozer"" → D(✓), O(❌), Z(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  \n  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5).  \n  - **Absent (add)**: O, Z.  \n- **Guess 4: ""duper"" → D(✓), U(❌), P(❌), E(✓), R(✓)**  \n  - **Correct positions**: D (position 1), E (position 4), R (position 5) (reaffirmed).  \n  - **Absent (add)**: U, P.  \n- **Summary**:  \n  - **Secret word structure**: `D _ _ E R`.  \n  - **Confirmed letters/positions**: D (1), E (4), R (5).  \n  - **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P → **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, W, X, Y.  \n  - **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3.  \n\n### Deductions for Fifth Guess  \n- The only valid English word fitting `D _ _ E R` with remaining letters is **""DEWER""** (D-E-W-E-R, meaning a person/thing that dewes or a tawer).  \n  - Position 2 = E (possible repeat, given E is at position 4).  \n  - Position 3 = W (available letter).  \n- Why ""DEWER""?  \n  - Tests E at position 2 (new position for E) and W (new letter).  \n  - If correct, the word is solved.

We have feedback from guess 5: ""dewer"" -> D(✓) E(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
- D at position 1: correct (already known)
- First E (position 2): correct (so E is in position 2)
- W at position 3: absent (x) so W is not in the word
- Second E (position 4): correct (already known)
- R at position 5: correct (already known)

But wait, in the word ""dewer"", the letters are:
Position 1: D
Position 2: E
Position 3: W
Position 4: E (the same as position 2? Actually, it's repeated)
Position 5: R

Now the feedback: 
- D(✓) -> correct
- E(✓) -> for the first E at position 2? But note: the secret word may have only one E? But here we have two E's in the guess? How does feedback work for repeated letters?

Rules state: feedback per letter. But in Wordle-style games, for repeated letters:
- If the letter is in the word only once, then one instance may be marked correct or in word, and the other absent? But here we have two E's in the guess, and the secret has E at position 4? But now we learn that E at position 2 is correct? 

The feedback: 
- Position 1: D(✓) 
- Position 2: E(✓) (this is the first E, position 2)
- Position 3: W(x) 
- Position 4: E(✓) (this is the second E, position 4) 
- Position 5: R(✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 2 and at position 4? Because both E's got (✓). But that means the word contains at least two E's? And both positions are correct.

But we also know from the feedback that W is absent? So we add W to absent list.

So the secret word pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: E
Position 3: ? (must be a letter, not W, and not absent)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

So the word is: D E ? E R

And the absent letters now: C, A, N, T, I, O, Z, U, P, W.

We need a letter for position 3? That isn't in the absent list? And such that D E ? E R is a valid English word.

But note: positions 2 and 4 are both E, so the word has at least two E's.

The letter at position 3 must be from the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, X, Y.

Now, what words fit D E ? E R? 

Considering common English words:
- ""DEBER"" -> not English
- ""DEFER"": D, E, F, E, R -> valid, meaning to put off or delay. Position 3: F? F is allowed? Not absent.
- ""DEMER"" -> not common
- ""DEXER"" -> rare? and X? but not absent? But let's see.
- ""DEYER"" -> not common? 
- ""DELE"" -> 4 letters? 
- ""DEVEL"" -> ends with L? 

So ""DEFER"" is a strong candidate? Does it use only allowed letters?
Letters: D, E, F, E, R? F is not in the absent list? So we can try ""DEFER"".

But are there other words? 
- ""DEKER"" -> K allowed? But not common? 
- ""DEQUER"" -> too long? 
- ""DESER"" -> not? 

Actually, ""DEFER"" seems the most common word.

But note: in the fifth guess, we are getting feedback? And the secret word is ""DEFER""? Let's see? But we must guess.

With only position 3 unknown? And we have one guess left? So we guess ""DEFER"" as candidate.

If the word is ""DEWER"", it would have been correct? But it had W at position3? And W was marked absent? So it's not ""DEWER""? Hence, we need the word with a different letter at position3.

So ""DEFER"" is a candidate? And it uses F? Which is not absent.

Another possibility: ""DELE"" isn't 5 letters.

""DERMA"" -> doesn't end with R? 

Thus, ""DEFER"" is the most likely.

Therefore, I will guess ""DEFER"".

So the secret word pattern: 
Position 1: D
Position 2: E
Position 3: ? (must be a letter, not W, and not absent)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

We need a letter for position 3? That isn't in the absent list? And such that D E ? E R is a valid English word.

The letter at position 3 must be from the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, V, X, Y.

Now, what words fit D E ? E R?
