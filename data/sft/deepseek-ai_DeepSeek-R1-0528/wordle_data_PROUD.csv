We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel. It covers C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2, since R is the second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 So, the secret word has R as the second letter, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word without the letters C, A, N, E, and with R in the second position.

 Since we know R is fixed at position 2, we can look for words that fit:
   _ R _ _ _

 And avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses new letters to maximize information.

 Possible words: 
   BRISK: B at start, R at position 2? But note: positions: 
     Position 1: not C (so not in list), and we don't know what is allowed for position1? But avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let's generate some words that fit:
   BRUSH -> B, R, U, S, H -> but U and S and H haven't been tested.
   TRUTH -> T, R, U, T, H -> but T repeats? Actually, truth has two T's. We can use duplicate letters only if the word allows? But we don't know if the secret has duplicates. However, our feedback didn't show any duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, words like:
   DRUM -> but that is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Longer: 
   BRICK -> has C? Wait, C is not allowed because feedback said C(x). So no.
   BROWN -> B, R, O, W, N -> but N(x) is not allowed? We know N is not in the word, so BROWN has N -> invalid.
   GROWL -> G, R, O, W, L -> no letters used? But L is new.

 However, we must avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let me list some words:
   PROUD: P, R, O, U, D -> no forbidden letters? Yes.
   GROUP: G, R, O, U, P -> same.
   TROUP? Not a word.

 But note: we also know the secret word doesn't have A, C, E, N.

 Another idea: use common letters that we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, U, etc.

 We can try:
   ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> avoids C,A,N,E.
   ""GRIPS"": G, R, I, P, S -> same.

 But note: also, position 1 must not be A,C,N,E, and we are safe with T, G, etc.

 Also, since we know R is at position 2, we should try to vary other positions.

 Considering information gain, using letters that are common and covering many new letters would be best.

 Let me choose ""GROUP"":
   G, R, O, U, P -> all new letters? 
   We haven't tested G, O, U, P.

 However, note that GROUP might not be the best because the O is in position 3 and U in position 4? 

 Alternatively, let's choose ""SPROUT"" -> 6 letters? No, 5-letter words only.

 Another word: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, R, O, U, D.

 But we have R fixed at position 2, so:
   P in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, U in 4, D in 5.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible without repeating.

 Decision: Let's go with ""PROUD"". But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters? 
   PROUD: P, R, O, U, D -> doesn't contain C, A, N, E -> allowed.

 Alternatively, is there a word that includes S? Because S is very common.

 I think: ""TRUMP"" -> T, R, U, M, P -> avoids forbidden? Yes.
   But note: we don't know about T, U, M, P.

 Also: ""FRUIT"" -> F, R, U, I, T -> but position: R at 2? Then F at1, U at3, I at4, T at5 -> avoids forbidden? Yes.

 Or: ""BRUSH"" -> B, R, U, S, H -> avoids forbidden.

 Let me pick ""BRUSH"" because it includes S which is common.

 But note: we have R at position 2, so:
   B at1, R at2, U at? position3, S at4, H at5.

 However, we don't have any information about the other positions.

 We might also consider words that have vowels we haven't tried? We haven't tried O, U, I.

 Let me choose ""PROUD"" -> but O and U are vowels.

 Let me choose a word that uses I: ""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> no forbidden? Yes.

 I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate because it tests P, I, S, M (new letters) and R is fixed.

 But note: we can also try to cover more vowels? We haven't tried O, U, I, etc.

 Another idea: to cover a vowel and common consonants? 

 Let's go with ""PRISM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the second guess, we need a word with R in the second position and avoid C, A, N, E. The word should maximize information by testing new letters. A strong candidate is **""PRISM""** because:
- It has R in position 2.
- It introduces new common letters: P, I, S, M (all untested).
- It covers positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 with letters that could reveal more about the secret word.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, the secret word has R in the second position and does not contain C, A, N, E.

Guess 2: PRISM
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2 (we already knew this)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

Therefore:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Combining the information:
- The secret word has P in position 1 and R in position 2: so the word starts with ""PR"".
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

We need to make a third guess that is a 5-letter word starting with ""PR"", without the letters C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using any of the absent letters and focus on the remaining possibilities.

The word pattern is: P R _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, and we want to test as many new letters as possible to gain information.

Common letters that are still possible: O, U, T, L, D, etc.

Possible words starting with ""PR"" and without forbidden letters:

- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven't tested O, U, D. However, note that in the second guess we already know I, S, M are absent, so O, U, D are allowed.
- PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> W and L are new.
- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are less common, but possible.
- PROFS: but F and S? S is absent, so not allowed.
- PRONG: P, R, O, N, G -> but N is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
- PROBE: P, R, O, B, E -> E is absent, invalid.
- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> E absent, invalid.
- PRY: too short.

We must avoid E, so words ending with E are out.

Another word: ""PROWL"" (P, R, O, W, L) - all new letters? O, W, L are new.

""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) - O, U, D are new.

But note: we have two vowels in ""PROUD"" (O and U) and one in ""PROWL"" (O). We might want to test more consonants? Or vowels? We haven't tested O and U, which are vowels, so it's good to test them.

Another possibility: ""PRUNE"" -> but E is absent and N is absent, so invalid.

""PRANK"" -> A and N are absent.

""PRINT"" -> I is absent.

""PRICE"" -> I and E absent.

So, let's list valid words:

- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D
- PROWL: P, R, O, W, L
- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y
- PROBS: but S is absent -> invalid.
- PROOF: O and F, but double O? We can use, but we are testing O only once? Actually, it has two O's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen duplicates so far, but it's possible. But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the guess? But if we use duplicate, we get less information about other letters.

We should avoid duplicates in the guess to cover more letters.

So, PROUD: 5 distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D -> but P and R are already known, so we are testing O, U, D.

Similarly, PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> testing O, W, L.

PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y -> testing O, X, Y.

We also have:

- PRONG: invalid because of N.
- PROBE: invalid because of E.
- PRUDE: invalid because of E and U? U is allowed? But E is absent.

What about ""PRONG""? N is absent, so no.

""PRONE"": E and N absent.

""PRATE"": A and E absent.

""PREST"": E and S absent.

""PRIED"": I and E absent.

So, back to the list.

Another word: ""PROSO"" -> not a word? And S is absent.

""PROUL"" -> not a word.

""PROLL"" -> not a word.

""PROKE"" -> not common? And E absent.

""PROGS"": S absent.

""PROLE"": E absent.

""PROMO"": O repeated? And M is absent (from guess2: M is absent). So invalid.

""PROOF"": O repeated and F? But M is absent? No, M is absent but F is new. However, O is repeated. We want to avoid repetition? And also, we are testing only two new letters: O and F? But O is repeated so we don't get information about other positions.

Similarly, ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" are better.

Another word: ""PRUTA"" -> not a word.

""PRUNT"" -> not common.

""PRYER"" -> E absent and R repeated? We already know R is in the word, but we are repeating it? We don't get new information from the repeated R.

So, let's consider:

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PROXY: tests O, X, Y

We also have ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" as more common words.

But note: we have not tested the vowel O and U, and consonants D, W, L, etc.

We might also consider words without O? Because O is a vowel and we haven't tested it, but we can test other vowels? We haven't tested U, and O is the only other common vowel we haven't tested? We have tested A, E, I (all absent) so only O and U are left? And sometimes Y.

But Y can be a vowel.

So, let's think of words without O? For example:

- PRUDE: invalid because of E.
- PRUTA: not a word.
- PRY: too short.

""PRYED"": E absent.

""PRANK"": A and N absent.

""PRINK"": I absent.

""PRICK"": I and C absent.

""PRIVY"": I absent.

So, it seems we have to use O? Because most common words starting with PR and without forbidden letters have O.

Another word: ""PRUNE"" -> E and N absent.

""PRONE"" -> E and N absent.

""PRATE"" -> A and E absent.

So, let's go with ""PROUD"" or ""PROWL"".

But note: in ""PROUD"", we are testing U and D, and in ""PROWL"", we are testing W and L.

We might also consider ""PROUD"" because it has two vowels (O and U) which might be more likely? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have O? But we don't have many options.

Wait, what about ""PRYKE""? Not a word.

""PRUNT"": not common.

""PREDY"": E absent.

So, I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice.

But let's check if there is a word that tests more common consonants? For example, T is a common letter we haven't tested. Is there a word ""PRT...""? Not really.

""PRINT"" is invalid because of I.

""PRATT"": A and T? But A is absent.

""PRETT"": not a word.

""PROTECT"" is too long.

""PROTO"": O repeated and T? But T is new. However, O repeated and we are testing only T and O? And we have two O's.

But we want to test more letters.

Another word: ""PROST"": S absent.

""PRUST"": not a word.

""PRUTA"": not a word.

""PRUTA"" is not valid.

So, I think ""PROUD"" is acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""PROUD"" uses P, R, O, U, D. P and R are known to be in the word and in the correct positions. O, U, D are new and not in the absent list.

Similarly, ""PROWL"" uses P, R, O, W, L.

We might also consider ""PROUD"" because if the secret word has a U or D, we get information.

But let's see the pattern: we know the word is PR _ _ _

We need to fill the last three.

We can also think of common words: proud, prowl, proxy, prong (invalid), probe (invalid), etc.

Another common word: ""PRICE"" is invalid.

""PRIME"" -> I and E absent.

""PRONE"" -> invalid.

So, I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice.

But wait, what about ""PRANK""? A and N absent -> invalid.

So, I'll go with ""PROUD"".

But note: we are not forced to use O. We can use other vowels? We have U and Y.

What about ""PRUDE""? But E is absent -> invalid.

""PRYER""? E absent.

""PRYED""? E absent.

""PRYSE""? S absent.

""PRY"": not 5 letters.

""PRUNT"": not common.

""PRUVY"": not a word.

So, I think we have to use O.

Therefore, I choose ""PROUD"".

But let's see if there is a word with Y? For example, ""PRY"" words: ""PRYER"" invalid, ""PRYSE"" invalid.

""PROSY"": S absent.

""PROXY"": that's a word. P, R, O, X, Y. It uses O, X, Y. X and Y are less common, but we can test them.

But ""PROUD"" tests more common letters: O, U, D.

U is a vowel and D is a common consonant.

Similarly, ""PROWL"" tests O, W, L.

W and L are common.

I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice.

But note: we already know P and R are in the word and fixed, so in the feedback for ""PROUD"", we will get:

- P: correct (we know)
- R: correct (we know)
- O: will be marked as absent, present but wrong position, or correct?
- U: same
- D: same

But we are hoping to get information about O, U, D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have P and R? But we know P and R are in the word and fixed at positions 1 and 2, so we must have them in the guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know they are correct. If we don't include them, we lose the chance to confirm? But we already know they are correct. However, by including them, we are using two positions that we already know, so we are only testing three new positions. But that's acceptable because we are focusing on the unknown.

We could also choose a word that has P and R in the same positions and tests new letters in the other positions.

So, I think ""PROUD"" is fine.

But let me check if there is a word that uses T? For example, ""PRT"" is not common. ""PRUTA"" not a word.

""PRATT"": A absent.

""PRETZEL"" too long.

""PRITZ"": not a word.

""PRETTY"": E and T? But E absent.

So, no.

Another idea: ""PROOF"" -> O repeated and F. But we are testing only O and F? And we know O might be present or not. But with repeated O, we don't get as much information.

Similarly, ""PROWL"" is better.

I think I'll go with ""PROWL"" because it tests W and L, which are common consonants, and O.

But ""PROUD"" tests U and D, which are also common.

Let's pick ""PROUD"" for now.

So, the third guess: ""PROUD""

But wait, let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are more likely to be in the word? We don't know.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. We have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

So, ""PROUD"" is valid.

Let me choose ""PROUD"".

But the assistant's previous guess was ""PRISM"", and now we are guessing ""PROUD"".

So, <guess>proud</guess>

But let me confirm: the word is ""proud"", 5 letters, starts with PR, and no forbidden letters.

Yes.

We'll see the feedback.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): R is correct and in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (PRISM): P is correct and in position 1; R is correct and in position 2 (already known); I, S, M are absent.

The secret word must start with ""PR"" (since P is in position 1 and R in position 2) and cannot contain C, A, N, E, I, S, M. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, we need a word starting with ""PR"" that tests new, common letters to maximize information. After evaluating options:
- Avoid words with repeated letters or absent letters.
- Focus on testing vowels (like O, U) and common consonants (like D, L, W).
- Strong candidates include PROUD (tests O, U, D), PROWL (tests O, W, L), or PROXY (tests O, X, Y).

PROUD is chosen because:
- It tests O (a common untested vowel) and U (another vowel) in positions 3 and 4, and D (a common consonant) in position 5.
- It avoids all absent letters and uses distinct new letters for better information gain.
- It is a valid 5-letter word fitting the known constraints.

<guess>proud</guess>",proud,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, the secret word has R in the second position and does not contain C, A, N, E.

Guess 2: PRISM
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2 (we already knew this)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

Therefore:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Combining the information:
- The secret word has P in position 1 and R in position 2: so the word starts with ""PR"".
- The secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

We need to make a third guess that is a 5-letter word starting with ""PR"", without the letters C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are less common, but possible.
- PROFS: but F and S? S is absent, so not allowed.
- PRONG: P, R, O, N, G -> but N is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
- PROBE: P, R, O, B, E -> E is absent, invalid.
- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> E absent, invalid.
- PRY: too short.

We must avoid E, so words ending with E are out.

Another word: ""PROWL"" (P, R, O, W, L) - all new letters? O, W, L are new.

""PROUD"" (P, R, O, U, D) - O, U, D are new.

But note: we have two vowels in ""PROUD"" (O and U) and one in ""PROWL"" (O). We might want to test more consonants? Or vowels? We haven't tested O and U, which are vowels, so it's good to test them.

Another possibility: ""PRUNE"" -> but E is absent and N is absent, so invalid.

""PRANK"" -> A and N are absent.

""PRINT"" -> I is absent.

""PRICE"" -> I and E absent.

So, let's list valid words:

- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D
- PROWL: P, R, O, W, L
- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y
- PROBS: but S is absent -> invalid.
- PROOF: O and F, but double O? We can use, but we are testing O only once? Actually, it has two O's. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen duplicates so far, but it's possible. But to maximize information, we might avoid duplicates in the guess?

We should avoid duplicates in the guess to cover more letters.

So, PROUD: 5 distinct letters: P, R, O, U, D -> but P and R are already known, so we are testing O, U, D.

Similarly, PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> testing O, W, L.

PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y -> testing O, X, Y.

We also have:

- PRONG: invalid because of N.
- PROBE: invalid because of E.
- PRUDE: invalid because of E and U? U is allowed? But E is absent.

What about ""PRONG""? N is absent, so no.

""PRONE"": E and N absent.

""PRATE"": A and E absent.

""PREST"": E and S absent.

""PRIED"": I and E absent.

So, back to the list.

""PROUL"" -> not a word.

""PROLL"" -> not a word.

""PROKE"" -> not common? And E absent.

""PROGS"": S absent.

""PROLE"": E absent.

""PROMO"": O repeated? And M is absent (from guess2: M is absent). So invalid.

""PROOF"": O repeated and F? But M is absent? No, M is absent but F is new. However, O is repeated. We want to avoid repetition? And also, we are testing only two new letters: O and F? But O is repeated so we don't get information about other positions.

Similarly, ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" are better.

Another word: ""PRUTA"" -> not a word.

""PRUNT"" -> not common.

""PRYER"" -> E absent and R repeated? We already know R is in the word, but we are repeating it? We don't get new information from the repeated R.

So, let's consider:

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PROXY: tests O, X, Y

We also have ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" as more common words.

But note: we have not tested the vowel O and U, and consonants D, W, L, etc.

We might also consider words without O? Because O is a vowel and we haven't tested it, but we can test other vowels? We haven't tested U, and O is the only other common vowel we haven't tested? We have tested A, E, I (all absent) so only O and U are left? And sometimes Y.

Therefore, I choose ""PROUD"".

But let's see if there is a word with Y? For example, ""PRY"" words: ""PRYER"" invalid, ""PRYSE"" invalid.

""PROSY"": S absent.

""PROXY"": that's a word. P, R, O, X, Y. It uses O, X, Y. X and Y are less common, but we can test them.

But ""PROUD"" tests more common letters: O, U, D.

U is a vowel and D is a common consonant.

Similarly, ""PROWL"" tests O, W, L.

W and L are common.

I think ""PROUD"" is a good choice.

But note: we already know P and R are in the word and fixed, so in the feedback for ""PROUD"", we will get:

- P: correct (we know)
- R: correct (we know)
- O: will be marked as absent, present but wrong position, or correct?
- U: same
- D: same

But we are hoping to get information about O, U, D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have P and R? But we know P and R are in the word and fixed at positions 1 and 2, so we must have them in the guess? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be inefficient because we know they are correct. If we don't include them, we lose the chance to confirm? But we already know they are correct. However, by including them, we are using two positions that we already know, so we are only testing three new positions. But that's acceptable because we are focusing on the unknown.

We could also choose a word that has P and R in the same positions and tests new letters in the other positions.

So, I think ""PROUD"" is fine.

But let me check if there is a word that uses T? For example, ""PRT"" is not common. ""PRUTA"" not a word.

""PRATT"": A absent.

""PRETZEL"" too long.

""PRITZ"": not a word.

""PRETTY"": E and T? But E absent.

So, no.

Another idea: ""PROOF"" -> O repeated and F. But we are testing only O and F? And we know O might be present or not. But with repeated O, we don't get as much information.

Similarly, ""PROWL"" is better.

I think I'll go with ""PROWL"" because it tests W and L, which are common consonants, and O.

But ""PROUD"" tests U and D, which are also common.

Let's pick ""PROUD"" for now.

So, the third guess: ""PROUD""

But wait, let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are more likely to be in the word? We don't know.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. We have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

So, ""PROUD"" is valid.

Let me choose ""PROUD"".

But the assistant's previous guess was ""PRISM"", and now we are guessing ""PROUD"".

So, <guess>proud</guess>

But let me confirm: the word is ""proud"", 5 letters, starts with PR, and no forbidden letters.

Yes.

We'll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): R is correct and in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
- Guess 2 (PRISM): P is correct and in position 1; R is correct and in position 2 (already known); I, S, M are absent.

The secret word must start with ""PR"" (since P is in position 1 and R in position 2) and cannot contain C, A, N, E, I, S, M. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the third guess, we need a word starting with ""PR"" that tests new, common letters to maximize information. After evaluating options:
- Avoid words with repeated letters or absent letters.
- Focus on testing vowels (like O, U) and common consonants (like D, L, W).
- Strong candidates include PROUD (tests O, U, D), PROWL (tests O, W, L), or PROXY (tests O, X, Y).

PROUD is chosen because:
- It tests O (a common untested vowel) and U (another vowel) in positions 3 and 4, and D (a common consonant) in position 5.
- It avoids all absent letters and uses distinct new letters for better information gain.
- It is a valid 5-letter word fitting the known constraints.",Guess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
