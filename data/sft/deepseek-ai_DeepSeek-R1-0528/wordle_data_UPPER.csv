We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position (as in ""crane""), and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and E (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions.
2. Avoids using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also note that the word is 5 letters.

Let's think of words that have R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and without C, A, N.

Possible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.

One common strategy is to try a word that puts R and E in new positions and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with R at the beginning? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning. However, we can try.

Example: ""ROUSE"" - but let's check:
  R is in position 1 (which is different from position 2) and E is in position 5? But wait, in the feedback, E was in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it's not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.

Actually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it's not there.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"":
  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)
  O, U, S are new letters.
  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it's not. That would be a waste because we already know that. We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4).

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Another candidate: ""TRIED""
  T: new
  R: at position 1 (was at 2 in first guess, so new position) -> okay
  I: new
  E: at position 4 (was at 5, now at 4) -> new position, so we can test if E is at 4.
  D: new

But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

Another: ""PRICE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""DRIVE"" -> D, I, V are new. R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it's not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient because we already know it's not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.

In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.

How about ""RIVET"":
  R at 1 (new position)
  I, V, T new
  E at 4 (new position)

This seems good.

Another: ""ROBES""
  R at 1
  O, B, S new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

Another: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""STORE""
  S, T, O new
  R at position 3? (new position, since previously at 2) -> okay
  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.

We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

Let me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

For example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

E at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don't know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.

E at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.

E at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.

Another with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.

Another: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2? In ""FRIED"", R is at position 2 -> we avoid because we know R is not at position 2.

How about ""WROTE"": 
  W, R, O, T, E -> R at position 2? Again, same problem.

We need R not at position 2.

So let's try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.

For example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.

""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.

""RIPED""? Not a word.

""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.

""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.

So let's go with ""RIVET"".

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it's acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.

""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.

""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""TIGER"": 
  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.

This seems good: ""TIGER"".

We avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.

And we test T, I, G.

So ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""LIVER"": 
  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.

But T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.

I think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.

But note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.

So I'll go with ""TIGER"".

Let me confirm: 
  T: new
  I: new
  G: new
  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)
  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.
- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).
  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).
  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

C: x (not in the word)

So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it's not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.

Actually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it's not there.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"":
  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)
  O, U, S are new letters.
  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it's not. That would be a waste because we already know that. We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4).

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Another candidate: ""TRIED""
  T: new
  R: at position 1 (was at 2 in first guess, so new position) -> okay
  I: new
  E: at position 4 (was at 5, now at 4) -> new position, so we can test if E is at 4.
  D: new

But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

Another: ""PRICE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""DRIVE"" -> D, I, V are new. R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it's not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient because we already know it's not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.

In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.

How about ""RIVET"":
  R at 1 (new position)
  I, V, T new
  E at 4 (new position)

This seems good.

Another: ""ROBES""
  R at 1
  O, B, S new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

Another: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""STORE""
  S, T, O new
  R at position 3? (new position, since previously at 2) -> okay
  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.

We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

Let me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

For example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

E at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don't know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.

E at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.

E at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.

Another with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.

Another: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2? In ""FRIED"", R is at position 2 -> we avoid because we know R is not at position 2.

How about ""WROTE"": 
  W, R, O, T, E -> R at position 2? Again, same problem.

We need R not at position 2.

So let's try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.

For example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.

""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.

""RIPED""? Not a word.

""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.

""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.

So let's go with ""RIVET"".

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it's acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.

""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.

""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""TIGER"": 
  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.

This seems good: ""TIGER"".

We avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.

And we test T, I, G.

So ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""LIVER"": 
  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.

But T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.

I think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.

But note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.

So I'll go with ""TIGER"".

Let me confirm: 
  T: new
  I: new
  G: new
  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)
  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.
- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).
  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).
  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. **First guess: crane**
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)

2. **Second guess: tiger**
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - G: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)
   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)

From this, we can deduce:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).

- **Absent letters:** 
   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).

- **Known letters in the word:** 
   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5). Now we see that in the second guess, E is at position 4 and R is at position 5, both correct. So these are confirmed.

- **Word structure:**
   - Position 1: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 2: unknown (but not R, and not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 3: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 4: E (confirmed)
   - Position 5: R (confirmed)

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
  - And the first three letters must be any letters except C, A, N, T, I, G (which are ruled out).
  - Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has an R and an E (already satisfied) and must have the R not in position 2 (but it is in position 5, so fine).

Moreover, in the first guess, ""crane"" had R in position 2 and E in position 5, and both were marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.

We also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.

Now, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.

Common 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it's _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.

Possible words could be:
  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).
  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.
  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R
  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R
  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R
  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.
  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.
  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.

But we have to see:

We must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So let's think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.

Also note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.

But in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.

For our current purpose, we need to think of common words.

We have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.

The letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.

So eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Remaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.

Common vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

Consonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

Possible words:
  - POWER: P O W E R
  - LOWER: L O W E R
  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)
  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.
  - HOVER: H O V E R
  - MOVER: M O V E R
  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.

Other words:
  - SOWER: S O W E R
  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.
  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are 'ER'.

What about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.

But we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E   (but we don't know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.

However, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.

Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked '-'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven't tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.

According to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E's, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.

To avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.

Moreover, we have only two guesses so far.

But for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.

We have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But if the secret word is FEWER, then:
- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn't test position 2 for E because we had I there.

Actually, in ""tiger"" we tested:
  Position 1: T -> x
  Position 2: I -> x
  Position 3: G -> x
  Position 4: E -> ✓
  Position 5: R -> ✓

So for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.

So it would fit.

However, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": 
  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

In FEWER:
  Position 2: E (was R in crane's guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that's fine.
  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked '-'? For E to be marked '-' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn't guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn't guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E's, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one '-' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we would still get one '-' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one '-' or '✓' appropriately.

Therefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.

But FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.

However, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.

We must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.

We have:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} 
  Position 2: similarly
  Position 3: similarly
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

And the word must be valid.

For our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.

We can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

We want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.

Proposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.

For example, ""POWER"": 
  P: unknown
  O: unknown
  W: unknown
  E: known at position 4
  R: known at position 5

But note: we might get very informative feedback.

Another option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R

But perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.

We know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Therefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.

We might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don't have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.

So let's think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.

Or ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.

But let me list possible words:

Words ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: 
  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:

We can think of:
  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.
  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.
  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.

Similarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).

""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.

But note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But we haven't tested F.

To get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.

For example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.

Similarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.

Or ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn't in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked 'x', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.

""BOZER""? Not common.

Another: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.

How about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.

And S,O,B are new.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.

""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.

But we don't know.

Since we have to guess, let's choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.

But note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven't been tested.

Specifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.

We have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Common letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.

We might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.

For example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R

But we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:

- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.

But note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.

There might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.

But we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.

Let us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.

Perhaps we choose a word that has O since it's a common vowel.

Another issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked '-', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it's at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked '-' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.

So no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn't indicate that there are multiple. The '-' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.

So we assume only one R and one E? Because we found them: R at 5, E at 4.

If there were multiple, we might see feedback indicating more? Not necessarily. So we shall guess assuming that E and R occur only once for now.

For example, let's assume the secret word has exactly one E and one R.

Then, for POWER: P, O, W : no conflict.

Similarly, LOVER: L, O, V; etc.

So let's choose ""POWER"" because we can test P, O, W.

Therefore, we guess ""POWER"".

Let me summarize:

- We know positions 4 and 5 are E and R.
- The secret word must have: letter1 = ?, letter2 = ?, letter3 = ?, letter4=E, letter5=R.
- We need a word using letters not ruled out (C,A,N,T,I,G) for the first three positions.

""POWER"" uses P (not used), O (not used), W (not used), and E and R known.

So it's a valid guess.

<guess>power</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:

1. **Known Correct Positions**:  
   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""tiger"").  
   - R is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"") and T, I, G (from ""tiger"") are not in the word.  

3. **Previous Guesses**:  
   - ""crane"": R is in the word but not position 2 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-). This is consistent since we now have E at position 4 and R at position 5.  

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`, where the first three letters must be:
- Letters **not** in {C, A, N, T, I, G}.  
- Possible common letters include B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

For this guess, **""POWER""** is chosen because:
- It tests three new common letters (P, O, W) for positions 1, 2, and 3.  
- It avoids repeating eliminated letters and leverages the known E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
- If the guess is incorrect, the feedback for P, O, and W will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three positions.  

This approach maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.

<guess>power</guess>",power,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. **First guess: crane**
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)

2. **Second guess: tiger**
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - G: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)
   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)

From this, we can deduce:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).

- **Absent letters:** 
   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).

- **Known letters in the word:** 
   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5). Now we see that in the second guess, E is at position 4 and R is at position 5, both correct. So these are confirmed.

- **Word structure:**
   - Position 1: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 2: unknown (but not R, and not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 3: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 4: E (confirmed)
   - Position 5: R (confirmed)

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
  - And the first three letters must be any letters except C, A, N, T, I, G (which are ruled out).
  - Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has an R and an E (already satisfied) and must have the R not in position 2 (but it is in position 5, so fine).

Moreover, in the first guess, ""crane"" had R in position 2 and E in position 5, and both were marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.

We also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.

Now, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.

Common 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it's _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.

Possible words could be:
  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).
  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.
  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R
  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R
  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R
  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.
  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.
  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.

But we have to see:

We must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So let's think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.

Also note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.

But in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.

For our current purpose, we need to think of common words.

We have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.

The letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.

So eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Remaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.

Common vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

Consonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

Possible words:
  - POWER: P O W E R
  - LOWER: L O W E R
  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)
  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.
  - HOVER: H O V E R
  - MOVER: M O V E R
  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.

Other words:
  - SOWER: S O W E R
  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.
  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are 'ER'.

What about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.

But we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E   (but we don't know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.

However, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.

Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked '-'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven't tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.

According to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E's, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.

To avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.

Moreover, we have only two guesses so far.

But for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.

We have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But if the secret word is FEWER, then:
- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn't test position 2 for E because we had I there.

Actually, in ""tiger"" we tested:
  Position 1: T -> x
  Position 2: I -> x
  Position 3: G -> x
  Position 4: E -> ✓
  Position 5: R -> ✓

So for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.

So it would fit.

However, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": 
  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

In FEWER:
  Position 2: E (was R in crane's guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that's fine.
  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked '-'? For E to be marked '-' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn't guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn't guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E's, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one '-' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we would still get one '-' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one '-' or '✓' appropriately.

Therefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.

But FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.

However, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.

We must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.

We have:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} 
  Position 2: similarly
  Position 3: similarly
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

And the word must be valid.

For our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.

We can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

We want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.

Proposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.

For example, ""POWER"": 
  P: unknown
  O: unknown
  W: unknown
  E: known at position 4
  R: known at position 5

But note: we might get very informative feedback.

Another option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R

But perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.

We know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Therefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.

We might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don't have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.

So let's think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.

Or ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.

But let me list possible words:

Words ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: 
  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:

We can think of:
  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.
  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.
  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.

Similarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).

""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.

But note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But we haven't tested F.

To get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.

For example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.

Similarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.

Or ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn't in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked 'x', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.

""BOZER""? Not common.

Another: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.

How about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.

And S,O,B are new.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.

""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.

But we don't know.

Since we have to guess, let's choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.

But note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven't been tested.

Specifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.

We have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Common letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.

We might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.

For example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R

But we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:

- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.

But note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.

There might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.

But we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.

Let us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.

Perhaps we choose a word that has O since it's a common vowel.

Another issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked '-', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it's at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked '-' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.

So no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn't indicate that there are multiple. The '-' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.

So we assume only one R and one E? Because we found them: R at 5, E at 4.

If there were multiple, we might see feedback indicating more? Not necessarily. So we shall guess assuming that E and R occur only once for now.

For example, let's assume the secret word has exactly one E and one R.

Then, for POWER: P, O, W : no conflict.

Similarly, LOVER: L, O, V; etc.

So let's choose ""POWER"" because we can test P, O, W.

Therefore, we guess ""POWER"".

Let me summarize:

- We know positions 4 and 5 are E and R.
- The secret word must have: letter1 = ?, letter2 = ?, letter3 = ?, letter4=E, letter5=R.
- We need a word using letters not ruled out (C,A,N,T,I,G) for the first three positions.

""POWER"" uses P (not used), O (not used), W (not used), and E and R known.

So it's a valid guess.

<guess>power</guess>Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:

1. **Known Correct Positions**:  
   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""tiger"").  
   - R is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"") and T, I, G (from ""tiger"") are not in the word.  

3. **Previous Guesses**:  
   - ""crane"": R is in the word but not position 2 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-). This is consistent since we now have E at position 4 and R at position 5.  

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`, where the first three letters must be:
- Letters **not** in {C, A, N, T, I, G}.  
- Possible common letters include B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

For this guess, **""POWER""** is chosen because:
- It tests three new common letters (P, O, W) for positions 1, 2, and 3.  
- It avoids repeating eliminated letters and leverages the known E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
- If the guess is incorrect, the feedback for P, O, and W will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three positions.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and E (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions.
2. Avoids using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also note that the word is 5 letters.

Let's think of words that have R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and without C, A, N.

Possible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.

One common strategy is to try a word that puts R and E in new positions and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with R at the beginning? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning. However, we can try.

Example: ""ROUSE"" - but let's check:
  R is in position 1 (which is different from position 2) and E is in position 5? But wait, in the feedback, E was in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it's not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.

Actually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it's not there.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"":
  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)
  O, U, S are new letters.
  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it's not. That would be a waste because we already know that. We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4).

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Another candidate: ""TRIED""
  T: new
  R: at position 1 (was at 2 in first guess, so new position) -> okay
  I: new
  E: at position 4 (was at 5, now at 4) -> new position, so we can test if E is at 4.
  D: new

But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

Another: ""PRICE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""DRIVE"" -> D, I, V are new. R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it's not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient because we already know it's not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.

In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.

How about ""RIVET"":
  R at 1 (new position)
  I, V, T new
  E at 4 (new position)

This seems good.

Another: ""ROBES""
  R at 1
  O, B, S new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

Another: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""STORE""
  S, T, O new
  R at position 3? (new position, since previously at 2) -> okay
  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.

We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

Let me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

For example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

E at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don't know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.

E at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.

E at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.

Another with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.

Another: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2? In ""FRIED"", R is at position 2 -> we avoid because we know R is not at position 2.

How about ""WROTE"": 
  W, R, O, T, E -> R at position 2? Again, same problem.

We need R not at position 2.

So let's try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.

For example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.

""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.

""RIPED""? Not a word.

""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.

""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.

So let's go with ""RIVET"".

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it's acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.

""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.

""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""TIGER"": 
  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.

This seems good: ""TIGER"".

We avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.

And we test T, I, G.

So ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""LIVER"": 
  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.

But T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.

I think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.

But note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.

So I'll go with ""TIGER"".

Let me confirm: 
  T: new
  I: new
  G: new
  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)
  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.
- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).
  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).
  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. **First guess: crane**
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)

2. **Second guess: tiger**
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - G: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)
   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)

From this, we can deduce:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).

- **Absent letters:** 
   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).

- **Known letters in the word:** 
   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5). Now we see that in the second guess, E is at position 4 and R is at position 5, both correct. So these are confirmed.

- **Word structure:**
   - Position 1: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 2: unknown (but not R, and not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 3: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 4: E (confirmed)
   - Position 5: R (confirmed)

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
  - And the first three letters must be any letters except C, A, N, T, I, G (which are ruled out).
  - Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has an R and an E (already satisfied) and must have the R not in position 2 (but it is in position 5, so fine).

Moreover, in the first guess, ""crane"" had R in position 2 and E in position 5, and both were marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.

We also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.

Now, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.

Common 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it's _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.

Possible words could be:
  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).
  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.
  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R
  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R
  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R
  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.
  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.
  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.

But we have to see:

We must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So let's think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.

Also note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.

But in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.

For our current purpose, we need to think of common words.

We have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.

The letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.

So eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Remaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.

Common vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

Consonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

Possible words:
  - POWER: P O W E R
  - LOWER: L O W E R
  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)
  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.
  - HOVER: H O V E R
  - MOVER: M O V E R
  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.

Other words:
  - SOWER: S O W E R
  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.
  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are 'ER'.

What about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.

But we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E   (but we don't know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.

However, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.

Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked '-'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven't tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.

According to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E's, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.

To avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.

Moreover, we have only two guesses so far.

But for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.

We have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But if the secret word is FEWER, then:
- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn't test position 2 for E because we had I there.

Actually, in ""tiger"" we tested:
  Position 1: T -> x
  Position 2: I -> x
  Position 3: G -> x
  Position 4: E -> ✓
  Position 5: R -> ✓

So for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.

So it would fit.

However, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": 
  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

In FEWER:
  Position 2: E (was R in crane's guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that's fine.
  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked '-'? For E to be marked '-' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn't guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn't guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E's, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one '-' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we would still get one '-' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one '-' or '✓' appropriately.

Therefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.

But FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.

However, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.

We must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.

We have:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} 
  Position 2: similarly
  Position 3: similarly
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

And the word must be valid.

For our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.

We can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

We want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.

Proposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.

For example, ""POWER"": 
  P: unknown
  O: unknown
  W: unknown
  E: known at position 4
  R: known at position 5

But note: we might get very informative feedback.

Another option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R

But perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.

We know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Therefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.

We might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don't have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.

So let's think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.

Or ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.

But let me list possible words:

Words ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: 
  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:

We can think of:
  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.
  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.
  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.

Similarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).

""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.

But note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But we haven't tested F.

To get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.

For example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.

Similarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.

Or ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn't in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked 'x', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.

""BOZER""? Not common.

Another: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.

How about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.

And S,O,B are new.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.

""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.

But we don't know.

Since we have to guess, let's choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.

But note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven't been tested.

Specifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.

We have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Common letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.

We might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.

For example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R

But we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:

- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.

But note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.

There might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.

But we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.

Let us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.

Perhaps we choose a word that has O since it's a common vowel.

Another issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked '-', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it's at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked '-' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.

So no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn't indicate that there are multiple. The '-' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.

So we assume only one R and one E? Because we found them: R at 5, E at 4.

If there were multiple, we might see feedback indicating more? Not necessarily. So we shall guess assuming that E and R occur only once for now.

For example, let's assume the secret word has exactly one E and one R.

Then, for POWER: P, O, W : no conflict.

Similarly, LOVER: L, O, V; etc.

So let's choose ""POWER"" because we can test P, O, W.

Therefore, we guess ""POWER"".

Let me summarize:

- We know positions 4 and 5 are E and R.
- The secret word must have: letter1 = ?, letter2 = ?, letter3 = ?, letter4=E, letter5=R.
- We need a word using letters not ruled out (C,A,N,T,I,G) for the first three positions.

""POWER"" uses P (not used), O (not used), W (not used), and E and R known.

So it's a valid guess.

<guess>power</guess>Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:

1. **Known Correct Positions**:  
   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""tiger"").  
   - R is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"") and T, I, G (from ""tiger"") are not in the word.  

3. **Previous Guesses**:  
   - ""crane"": R is in the word but not position 2 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-). This is consistent since we now have E at position 4 and R at position 5.  

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`, where the first three letters must be:
- Letters **not** in {C, A, N, T, I, G}.  
- Possible common letters include B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

For this guess, **""POWER""** is chosen because:
- It tests three new common letters (P, O, W) for positions 1, 2, and 3.  
- It avoids repeating eliminated letters and leverages the known E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
- If the guess is incorrect, the feedback for P, O, and W will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three positions.  

This approach maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.

We should choose a word that:\n1. Includes R and E (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions.\n2. Avoids using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).\n3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nWe also note that the word is 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and without C, A, N.\n\nPossible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\nOne common strategy is to try a word that puts R and E in new positions and includes other vowels or common consonants.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- We could try a word with R at the beginning? But note: we don\'t know if R is at the beginning. However, we can try.\n\nExample: ""ROUSE"" - but let\'s check:\n  R is in position 1 (which is different from position 2) and E is in position 5? But wait, in the feedback, E was in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it\'s not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.\n\nActually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, in ""ROUSE"":\n  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)\n  O, U, S are new letters.\n  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it\'s not. That would be a waste because we already know that. We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4).\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRIED""\n  T: new\n  R: at position 1 (was at 2 in first guess, so new position) -> okay\n  I: new\n  E: at position 4 (was at 5, now at 4) -> new position, so we can test if E is at 4.\n  D: new\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn\'t have them.\n\nAnother: ""PRICE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""DRIVE"" -> D, I, V are new. R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it\'s inefficient because we already know it\'s not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.\n\nIn ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.\n\nHow about ""RIVET"":\n  R at 1 (new position)\n  I, V, T new\n  E at 4 (new position)\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother: ""ROBES""\n  R at 1\n  O, B, S new\n  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\nAnother: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""STORE""\n  S, T, O new\n  R at position 3? (new position, since previously at 2) -> okay\n  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.\n\nWe need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\nLet me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nFor example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nE at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don\'t know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.\n\nE at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.\n\nE at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.\n\nAnother with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2? In ""FRIED"", R is at position 2 -> we avoid because we know R is not at position 2.\n\nHow about ""WROTE"": \n  W, R, O, T, E -> R at position 2? Again, same problem.\n\nWe need R not at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nFor example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.\n\n""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.\n\n""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.\n\n""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""RIVET"".\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.\n\n""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.\n\n""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.\n\n""TIGER"": \n  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.\n\nThis seems good: ""TIGER"".\n\nWe avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.\n\nAnd we test T, I, G.\n\nSo ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.\n\n""LIVER"": \n  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.\n\nBut T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.\n\nI think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TIGER"".\n\nLet me confirm: \n  T: new\n  I: new\n  G: new\n  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)\n  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.\n- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.\n- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:\n  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).\n  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).\n  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. **First guess: crane**\n   - C: x (not in the word)\n   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)\n   - A: x (not in the word)\n   - N: x (not in the word)\n   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)\n\n2. **Second guess: tiger**\n   - T: x (not in the word)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - G: x (not in the word)\n   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)\n   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- **Confirmed letters and positions:**\n   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).\n   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).\n\n- **Absent letters:** \n   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).\n\n- **Known letters in the word:** \n   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5). Now we see that in the second guess, E is at position 4 and R is at position 5, both correct. So these are confirmed.\n\n- **Word structure:**\n   - Position 1: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)\n   - Position 2: unknown (but not R, and not C, A, N, T, I, G)\n   - Position 3: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)\n   - Position 4: E (confirmed)\n   - Position 5: R (confirmed)\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that has:\n  - Position 4: E\n  - Position 5: R\n  - And the first three letters must be any letters except C, A, N, T, I, G (which are ruled out).\n  - Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has an R and an E (already satisfied) and must have the R not in position 2 (but it is in position 5, so fine).\n\nMoreover, in the first guess, ""crane"" had R in position 2 and E in position 5, and both were marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.\n\nSo the secret word is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.\n\nWe also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.\n\nNow, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.\n\nCommon 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it\'s _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.\n\nPossible words could be:\n  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).\n  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.\n  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R\n  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R\n  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R\n  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.\n  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.\n  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.\n\nBut we have to see:\n\nWe must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.\n\nAlso note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.\n\nBut in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.\n\nFor our current purpose, we need to think of common words.\n\nWe have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nThe letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.\n\nSo eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nRemaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).\n\nConsonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words: _ _ _ E R\n\nPossible words:\n  - POWER: P O W E R\n  - LOWER: L O W E R\n  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)\n  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.\n  - HOVER: H O V E R\n  - MOVER: M O V E R\n  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.\n\nOther words:\n  - SOWER: S O W E R\n  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.\n  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are \'ER\'.\n\nWhat about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.\n\nBut we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:\n  Position 1: F\n  Position 2: E   (but we don\'t know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.\n\nHowever, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.\n\nNow, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked \'-\'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked \'✓\', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven\'t tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.\n\nAccording to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E\'s, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.\n\nTo avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.\n\nMoreover, we have only two guesses so far.\n\nBut for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.\n\nWe have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut if the secret word is FEWER, then:\n- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn\'t test position 2 for E because we had I there.\n\nActually, in ""tiger"" we tested:\n  Position 1: T -> x\n  Position 2: I -> x\n  Position 3: G -> x\n  Position 4: E -> ✓\n  Position 5: R -> ✓\n\nSo for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.\n\nSo it would fit.\n\nHowever, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": \n  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n\nIn FEWER:\n  Position 2: E (was R in crane\'s guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that\'s fine.\n  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked \'-\'? For E to be marked \'-\' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn\'t guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn\'t guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E\'s, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one \'-\' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E\'s, we would still get one \'-\' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one \'-\' or \'✓\' appropriately.\n\nTherefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.\n\nBut FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.\n\nHowever, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.\n\nWe must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.\n\nWe have:\n  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} \n  Position 2: similarly\n  Position 3: similarly\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: R\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nFor our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.\n\nWe can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.\n\nProposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"": \n  P: unknown\n  O: unknown\n  W: unknown\n  E: known at position 4\n  R: known at position 5\n\nBut note: we might get very informative feedback.\n\nAnother option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R\n\nBut perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.\n\nTherefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.\n\nWe might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don\'t have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.\n\nSo let\'s think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.\n\nBut let me list possible words:\n\nWords ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: \n  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:\n\nWe can think of:\n  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.\n  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.\n  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).\n\n""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.\n\nBut note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested F.\n\nTo get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.\n\nOr ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn\'t in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked \'x\', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.\n\n""BOZER""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.\n\nHow about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.\n\nAnd S,O,B are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.\n\n""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSince we have to guess, let\'s choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.\n\nBut note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.\n\nPerhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nSpecifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.\n\nEliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.\n\nCommon letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.\n\nWe might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.\n\nFor example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R\n\nBut we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:\n\n- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.\n\nBut note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.\n\nThere might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.\n\nBut we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.\n\nLet us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.\n\nPerhaps we choose a word that has O since it\'s a common vowel.\n\nAnother issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked \'-\', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it\'s at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked \'-\' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.\n\nSo no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that there are multiple. The \'-\' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.\n\nSo we assume only one R and one E?

We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **tiger**: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - T, I, G are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4.
   - R is correct at position 5.

3. **power**: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - P is in the word but not in position 1 (since it's marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).
   - O and W are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4 (already known).
   - R is correct at position 5 (already known).

From this, we can deduce:

- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R

- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W
  - Total absent: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
  - R and E were already placed (positions 5 and 4 respectively).
  - P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""power"" feedback).

Also, from the first guess, we knew R and E were present, which are now placed.

So the secret word has:
- P in it, but not at position 1.
- And the known positions: 4=E, 5=R.

The word pattern: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1 cannot be P (because in ""power"", P at position 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 1). So P must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W.

So the available letters for positions 1,2,3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and P is in the word, so must be used in position 2 or 3).

But note: we must include P in the word at position 2 or 3.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: [letter1][letter2][letter3] E R

With:
- letter1: not P, and not in {C,A,N,T,I,G,O,W}
- letter2: could be P or another letter, but P must be in the word at position 2 or 3.
- letter3: similarly.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:

We know P is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3.

Case 1: P at position 2: then the word is _ P _ E R

Case 2: P at position 3: then the word is _ _ P E R

We can think of common words:

For case 2: _ _ P E R
  Examples: UPPER (but U and P, but U is allowed? But we have two P's? The word UPPER has two P's? U, P, P, E, R -> so positions: 1:U, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. But we have P at position 2 and 3? However, in our feedback, we only know that P is present (at least one occurrence) and not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at position 2 and 3. But we don't know if there are multiple P's.

But note: in the guess ""power"", we had only one P (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one P. If the secret has two P's, that's fine, but we only get one mark for the P we guessed? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence? In Wordle, if the secret has two of a letter and you guess one, you get one mark. If you guess two and the secret has two, both get marked appropriately.

But in our case, we only guessed one P, so we know there is at least one P, but there could be more.

Similarly, for UPPER: it has P at positions 2 and 3.

But we also have to check the absent letters: O and W are absent, and U is not absent? We haven't tested U.

But let's list possible words.

First, for pattern _ _ P E R:
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but we have two P's? And U is a vowel.
  - SUPPER: S,U,P,P,E,R -> 6 letters? No, SUPPER is 6? S-U-P-P-E-R -> 6 letters. Not 5.
  - PAPER: P,A,P,E,R -> but A is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
  - CAPER: C,A,P,E,R -> C and A absent, invalid.
  - TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> T and A absent.
  - VIPER: V,I,P,E,R -> I absent.
  - RIPER: not common, and R is already at position 5? But R is at 5, so position 1 cannot be R? We don't know, but in this pattern, position 1 is not P, so it could be R? But we have R at position 5, and if there is another R? But we don't know.

Actually, we don't have information about multiple R's. In the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position, and in the second guess, R at position 5 is correct. So if the secret has only one R, then that R is at position 5. If it has two, then there might be another R.

But in the pattern _ _ P E R, if we put R at position 1, then the word is R _ P E R, which would have two R's? For example, ""RIPER"" is not a word. ""RAPER"" has A, invalid. ""ROPER"" has O, which is absent (from power: O is x). ""RUPER"" not a word.

So perhaps no common words with R at position 1 and P at position 3.

Other words for _ _ P E R:
  - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> fits. And S and U are not eliminated.
  - DUPER: D,U,P,E,R -> also possible, but less common.
  - JUPER: not a word.
  - LOPER: L,O,P,E,R -> but O is absent (from power: O is x).
  - MOPER: M,O,P,E,R -> O absent.
  - HOPER: H,O,P,E,R -> O absent.

So ""SUPER"" is a candidate.

Now, case 1: P at position 2: pattern _ P _ E R
  Examples:
    - UPPER: but that has P at position 2 and 3? So it fits both patterns? Actually, in UPPER, P is at 2 and 3, so it would be _ P _ E R with the third letter being P? But the pattern is _ P _ E R, meaning position 2 is P, position 3 is something else? In UPPER, position 3 is P, so it's the same as the second pattern? Let me write:
        U P P E R -> position 2 is P, position 3 is P. So for pattern _ P _ E R, the third position is P? But then it's not a different letter.

  But we can have words where position 2 is P and position 3 is not P.

  For example:
    - APTER: A,P,T,E,R -> A and T absent.
    - OPTER: O,P,T,E,R -> O and T absent.
    - SPHER: not a word.
    - SPIER: S,P,I,E,R -> I absent.
    - SPEER: S,P,E,E,R -> but E at position 3? Then we have E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E, so if position 3 is E, that would be a repeated E? And in the feedback, we have E at position 4 correct, but we don't know about other E's.

  However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If there is another E at position 3, that would be possible? But let's see the feedback for E in the first guess: we had one E guessed and it was marked as present but not at position 5. If the secret has two E's, that's fine, but we only got one mark for E in the first guess? Actually, the feedback would only mark one E as present (the first occurrence that isn't matched?).

  But to avoid complexity, let's list:

  For _ P _ E R:
    - SUPER is not, because SUPER has P at position 3.
    - PAPER: invalid.
    - Perhaps ""SPEER""? But SPEER is a proper name? Not common.
    - ""UPPER"" has P at 2 and 3, so it fits _ P _ E R? Yes, but the third letter is P, so it's _ P P E R.

  But we also have ""UPPER"" as a candidate for the other pattern.

  Another: ""OPERA"" is 5 letters? O-P-E-R-A -> but that ends with A, not E R? We need to end with E R.

  How about ""SPERM"": S,P,E,R,M -> but that ends with M, not R? Positions: 1:S,2:P,3:E,4:R,5:M -> but we need position 4 to be E and 5 to be R? So not.

  ""SPERT"" not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for _ P _ E R is ""UPPER"", but that has P at position 3 as well.

  Alternatively, ""APRES"" is a word? A-P-R-E-S -> but ends with S, not R? And A is absent.

  So let's focus on the pattern with P at position 3: _ _ P E R

  We have ""SUPER"" as a candidate.

  Also, ""DUPER"" (if accepted), ""HYPER"" (H,Y,P,E,R) -> H and Y not eliminated.

  ""HYPER"" is a common word.

  ""JAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""VAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""PIPER"" has I, invalid.

  ""MOPED"" doesn't end with ER.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER (which has two P's).

  Now, from the feedback of ""power"", we have P marked as present but not at position 1. In ""SUPER"", P is at position 3. In ""HYPER"", P is at position 3. In ""UPPER"", P is at positions 2 and 3.

  Also, we have to consider that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 must not be one of the absent letters.

  For SUPER: position 1 is S, which is not eliminated.
  For HYPER: position 1 is H, not eliminated.
  For UPPER: position 1 is U, not eliminated.

  But we have more information: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position. Now we know R is at position 5. So if the secret word has only one R, then there is no R at position 2. But if it has two R's, then position 2 could be R? But in our candidates, none of them have R at position 2? 
    - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - HYPER: H,Y,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - UPPER: U,P,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.

  So that's consistent.

  Now, we need to make a guess that can distinguish between these or get the word.

  We also have to consider other possibilities? For example, P might be at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word for _ P _ E R without the third letter being P? So maybe UPPER is the only one? But UPPER has P at both 2 and 3.

  Another possibility: the word might have P at position 2 and a different letter at 3? For example, ""SPEAR"": S,P,E,A,R -> but A is absent? And also, position 3 is E? But we have position 4 as E, so if position 3 is E, then we have two E's? And in ""SPEAR"", the E is at position 3 and A at 4? But we need position 4 to be E? So not.

  ""SPEED"" ends with D, not R.

  So perhaps the main candidates are SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER.

  We also have to consider that in the pattern _ _ P E R, the first two letters can be other combinations.

  For example, ""LEPER"": L,E,P,E,R -> but E at position 2? Then we have E at position 2 and 4? And L is not eliminated. But in ""LEPER"", the letters: 1:L, 2:E, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R.

  Now, we know E is at position 4. If there is an E at position 2, that would be a second E? And we have not tested position 2 for E? In the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but not there, so the secret has at least one E. In the second guess, we had E at position 4 correct. If there is a second E at position 2, that's possible? But in the feedback for ""tiger"", we had no E at position 2? ""tiger"" had I at position 2, which was absent. So we don't know about position 2.

  But in ""LEPER"", we have E at position 2. Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not there. That E could be the one at position 2? Or the one at position 4? Since we only guessed one E, the feedback marks one occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we still only get one mark for the E we guessed? So it's possible.

  Similarly, for ""power"", we had no E at position 1? But we had E at position 4 correct.

  So ""LEPER"" is also a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SEVER"": S,E,V,E,R -> but E at position 2 and 4? And V not eliminated. But ""SEVER"" ends with E,R? S,E,V,E,R -> positions: 1:S,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R -> so position 4 is E, position 5 is R? Yes.

  But we have E at position 2? So two E's.

  And ""BEVER""? Not common.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER, LEPER, SEVER, etc.

  But we need to use the fact that in ""power"", P is present but not at position 1. In LEPER and SEVER, there is no P? So they don't have P? But we know P is in the word! From ""power"", P is present.

  Therefore, LEPER and SEVER do not have P, so they are invalid.

  So only candidates with P: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  And we must have P in the word.

  So the secret word must be one of: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  Now, we need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish.

  We have 3 possibilities. We can guess one of them.

  But note: we have to make a guess that is a valid word and uses only available letters.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first three positions with new letters to narrow down.

  But since we have only three candidates, we can guess one.

  Let's see the letters:

  - SUPER: S, U, P, E, R
  - HYPER: H, Y, P, E, R
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R

  We can try to guess a word that includes S, U, H, Y, or double P to distinguish.

  But we also have to avoid eliminated letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"" directly.

  Or, to get more information, we might guess a word that has, say, S and H? But we don't know.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are at the fourth guess, we can try ""SUPER"".

  But if we guess ""SUPER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback that might help.

  Similarly, we can guess ""HUMPH"" or something, but that doesn't fit the pattern? We have to have E at 4 and R at 5.

  We must guess a word that has E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed.

  So our guess must be of the form _ _ _ E R.

  And we want to test the first three letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"": which is one of the candidates.

  Or we can guess ""HYPER"".

  Or we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests other letters? But we don't have many letters left.

  For example, we can guess ""SAMER"" but A is absent? Not.

  ""SIZER"" has I and Z? I absent.

  ""SYRUP"": S,Y,R,U,P -> but doesn't end with E R? We need position 4 to be E, but in SYRUP: S,Y,R,U,P -> position 4 is U, not E.

  So we cannot guess a word that doesn't have E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed, so we must use them to get information about the first three.

  Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""SUPER"" as it is a common word.

  But note: in ""SUPER"", we have S at position 1, U at 2, P at 3.

  If the secret is ""HYPER"", then in ""SUPER"":
    - S at position 1: would be absent? Because HYPER has H at 1, not S.
    - U at position 2: absent? HYPER has Y at 2.
    - P at position 3: present and correct? Both SUPER and HYPER have P at 3? So it would be ✓ for P? And E and R ✓.

  So feedback would be: S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know it's not SUPER, and we have two candidates left: HYPER and UPPER.

  Then we can guess HYPER next.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""UPPER"", then:
    - S at 1: absent? UPPER has U at 1? So S is not in the word? But UPPER has no S, so S would be x.
    - U at 2: in UPPER, position 2 is P, not U? So U would be absent? Or present? U is in UPPER at position 1? But we are guessing U at position 2. So U is in the word but not at position 2? Then U would be marked as '-'.

  Let's simulate:

  Secret: UPPER (U,P,P,E,R)
  Guess: SUPER (S,U,P,E,R)

  Feedback:
    - Position 1: S vs U -> S is not in the word? UPPER has no S -> x
    - Position 2: U vs P -> U is in the word? U is at position 1 in secret, so U is present but not at position 2 -> '-'
    - Position 3: P vs P -> ✓
    - Position 4: E vs E -> ✓
    - Position 5: R vs R -> ✓

  So feedback: S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know U is in the word but not at position 2. And since we know the word has E at 4 and R at 5, and P at 3, then the word must be UPPER? Because the only candidate with P at 3 and U present is UPPER? And U must be at position 1? Because we have position 1 open.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""HYPER"", we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) meaning the first two are wrong and P is at 3, so then the word must be HYPER? But what about UPPER? In this case, we got U as absent? So UPPER would have U, so if we got U absent, then UPPER is eliminated? 

  In the feedback for ""SUPER"" when secret is ""HYPER"":
    - S: not in HYPER -> x
    - U: not in HYPER -> x
    - P: in position 3 -> ✓
    - E: ✓
    - R: ✓

  So U is marked x, meaning not in the word. Therefore, UPPER has U, so it would be eliminated? Because if U is not in the word, then UPPER cannot be the word.

  So by guessing ""SUPER"", we can distinguish:

  - If we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is HYPER (since UPPER has U and would not be possible).
  - If we get S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is UPPER (because U is present but not at position 2, and HYPER would have given U as absent).
  - If we get all ✓ except maybe the first two, but if it's SUPER, we get all ✓.

  So it's a good guess.

  Alternatively, we could guess ""HYPER"" or ""UPPER"" directly.

  But to save a guess, we can guess ""SUPER"".

  However, we have three candidates, and we are at guess 4.

  Let's guess ""SUPER"".

  If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us which of the other two it is.

  So I think ""SUPER"" is a good guess.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""SUPER"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, A, N are absent; R and E are present but in wrong positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- **Guess 2 (tiger)**: T, I, G are absent; E is correct at position 4; R is correct at position 5.
- **Guess 3 (power)**: O and W are absent; P is present but not in position 1; E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**: 
  - Position 4 = E (from ""tiger"" ✓).
  - Position 5 = R (from ""tiger"" ✓).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters**:
  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""power"" -).
- **Word Pattern**: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as E and R).
- P must be in position 2 or 3 (since it cannot be in position 1 and is not in positions 4–5).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must include P (in position 2 or 3) and exclude all absent letters.
- Possible candidates (valid English words fitting `_ _ _ E R` with P in position 2 or 3):
  - **SUPER**: Positions: S (1), U (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **HYPER**: Positions: H (1), Y (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **UPPER**: Positions: U (1), P (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
- **Strategy**: Guess **SUPER** to test the candidates:
  - If correct, the game ends.
  - If incorrect, feedback on S and U will distinguish between HYPER and UPPER:
    - If S and U are absent (x), the word is **HYPER** (since UPPER requires U).
    - If U is present but wrong position (-), the word is **UPPER** (SUPER's U at position 2 would be misplaced if UPPER has U at position 1).

This guess maximizes information gain by leveraging the fixed E and R positions and testing P in position 3 while probing two key candidates (SUPER and UPPER) in one move.

<guess>super</guess>",super,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **tiger**: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - T, I, G are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4.
   - R is correct at position 5.

3. **power**: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - P is in the word but not in position 1 (since it's marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).
   - O and W are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4 (already known).
   - R is correct at position 5 (already known).

From this, we can deduce:

- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R

- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W
  - Total absent: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
  - R and E were already placed (positions 5 and 4 respectively).
  - P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""power"" feedback).

Also, from the first guess, we knew R and E were present, which are now placed.

So the secret word has:
- P in it, but not at position 1.
- And the known positions: 4=E, 5=R.

The word pattern: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1 cannot be P (because in ""power"", P at position 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 1). So P must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W.

So the available letters for positions 1,2,3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and P is in the word, so must be used in position 2 or 3).

But note: we must include P in the word at position 2 or 3.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: [letter1][letter2][letter3] E R

With:
- letter1: not P, and not in {C,A,N,T,I,G,O,W}
- letter2: could be P or another letter, but P must be in the word at position 2 or 3.
- letter3: similarly.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:

We know P is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3.

Case 1: P at position 2: then the word is _ P _ E R

Case 2: P at position 3: then the word is _ _ P E R

We can think of common words:

For case 2: _ _ P E R
  Examples: UPPER (but U and P, but U is allowed? But we have two P's? The word UPPER has two P's? U, P, P, E, R -> so positions: 1:U, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. But we have P at position 2 and 3? However, in our feedback, we only know that P is present (at least one occurrence) and not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at position 2 and 3. But we don't know if there are multiple P's.

But note: in the guess ""power"", we had only one P (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one P. If the secret has two P's, that's fine, but we only get one mark for the P we guessed? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence? In Wordle, if the secret has two of a letter and you guess one, you get one mark. If you guess two and the secret has two, both get marked appropriately.

But in our case, we only guessed one P, so we know there is at least one P, but there could be more.

Similarly, for UPPER: it has P at positions 2 and 3.

But we also have to check the absent letters: O and W are absent, and U is not absent? We haven't tested U.

But let's list possible words.

First, for pattern _ _ P E R:
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but we have two P's? And U is a vowel.
  - SUPPER: S,U,P,P,E,R -> 6 letters? No, SUPPER is 6? S-U-P-P-E-R -> 6 letters. Not 5.
  - PAPER: P,A,P,E,R -> but A is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
  - CAPER: C,A,P,E,R -> C and A absent, invalid.
  - TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> T and A absent.
  - VIPER: V,I,P,E,R -> I absent.
  - RIPER: not common, and R is already at position 5? But R is at 5, so position 1 cannot be R? We don't know, but in this pattern, position 1 is not P, so it could be R? But we have R at position 5, and if there is another R? But we don't know.

Actually, we don't have information about multiple R's. In the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position, and in the second guess, R at position 5 is correct. So if the secret has only one R, then that R is at position 5. If it has two, then there might be another R.

But in the pattern _ _ P E R, if we put R at position 1, then the word is R _ P E R, which would have two R's? For example, ""RIPER"" is not a word. ""RAPER"" has A, invalid. ""ROPER"" has O, which is absent (from power: O is x). ""RUPER"" not a word.

So perhaps no common words with R at position 1 and P at position 3.

Other words for _ _ P E R:
  - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> fits. And S and U are not eliminated.
  - DUPER: D,U,P,E,R -> also possible, but less common.
  - JUPER: not a word.
  - LOPER: L,O,P,E,R -> but O is absent (from power: O is x).
  - MOPER: M,O,P,E,R -> O absent.
  - HOPER: H,O,P,E,R -> O absent.

So ""SUPER"" is a candidate.

Now, case 1: P at position 2: pattern _ P _ E R
  Examples:
    - UPPER: but that has P at position 2 and 3? So it fits both patterns? Actually, in UPPER, P is at 2 and 3, so it would be _ P _ E R with the third letter being P? But the pattern is _ P _ E R, meaning position 2 is P, position 3 is something else? In UPPER, position 3 is P, so it's the same as the second pattern? Let me write:
        U P P E R -> position 2 is P, position 3 is P. So for pattern _ P _ E R, the third position is P? But then it's not a different letter.

  But we can have words where position 2 is P and position 3 is not P.

  For example:
    - APTER: A,P,T,E,R -> A and T absent.
    - OPTER: O,P,T,E,R -> O and T absent.
    - SPHER: not a word.
    - SPIER: S,P,I,E,R -> I absent.
    - SPEER: S,P,E,E,R -> but E at position 3? Then we have E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E, so if position 3 is E, that would be a repeated E? And in the feedback, we have E at position 4 correct, but we don't know about other E's.

  However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If there is another E at position 3, that would be possible? But let's see the feedback for E in the first guess: we had one E guessed and it was marked as present but not at position 5. If the secret has two E's, that's fine, but we only got one mark for E in the first guess? Actually, the feedback would only mark one E as present (the first occurrence that isn't matched?).

  But to avoid complexity, let's list:

  For _ P _ E R:
    - SUPER is not, because SUPER has P at position 3.
    - PAPER: invalid.
    - Perhaps ""SPEER""? But SPEER is a proper name? Not common.
    - ""UPPER"" has P at 2 and 3, so it fits _ P _ E R? Yes, but the third letter is P, so it's _ P P E R.

  But we also have ""UPPER"" as a candidate for the other pattern.

  Another: ""OPERA"" is 5 letters? O-P-E-R-A -> but that ends with A, not E R? We need to end with E R.

  How about ""SPERM"": S,P,E,R,M -> but that ends with M, not R? Positions: 1:S,2:P,3:E,4:R,5:M -> but we need position 4 to be E and 5 to be R? So not.

  ""SPERT"" not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for _ P _ E R is ""UPPER"", but that has P at position 3 as well.

  Alternatively, ""APRES"" is a word? A-P-R-E-S -> but ends with S, not R? And A is absent.

  So let's focus on the pattern with P at position 3: _ _ P E R

  We have ""SUPER"" as a candidate.

  Also, ""DUPER"" (if accepted), ""HYPER"" (H,Y,P,E,R) -> H and Y not eliminated.

  ""HYPER"" is a common word.

  ""JAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""VAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""PIPER"" has I, invalid.

  ""MOPED"" doesn't end with ER.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER (which has two P's).

  Now, from the feedback of ""power"", we have P marked as present but not at position 1. In ""SUPER"", P is at position 3. In ""HYPER"", P is at position 3. In ""UPPER"", P is at positions 2 and 3.

  Also, we have to consider that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 must not be one of the absent letters.

  For SUPER: position 1 is S, which is not eliminated.
  For HYPER: position 1 is H, not eliminated.
  For UPPER: position 1 is U, not eliminated.

  But we have more information: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position. Now we know R is at position 5. So if the secret word has only one R, then there is no R at position 2. But if it has two R's, then position 2 could be R? But in our candidates, none of them have R at position 2? 
    - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - HYPER: H,Y,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - UPPER: U,P,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.

  So that's consistent.

  Now, we need to make a guess that can distinguish between these or get the word.

  We also have to consider other possibilities? For example, P might be at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word for _ P _ E R without the third letter being P? So maybe UPPER is the only one? But UPPER has P at both 2 and 3.

  Another possibility: the word might have P at position 2 and a different letter at 3? For example, ""SPEAR"": S,P,E,A,R -> but A is absent? And also, position 3 is E? But we have position 4 as E, so if position 3 is E, then we have two E's? And in ""SPEAR"", the E is at position 3 and A at 4? But we need position 4 to be E? So not.

  ""SPEED"" ends with D, not R.

  So perhaps the main candidates are SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER.

  We also have to consider that in the pattern _ _ P E R, the first two letters can be other combinations.

  For example, ""LEPER"": L,E,P,E,R -> but E at position 2? Then we have E at position 2 and 4? And L is not eliminated. But in ""LEPER"", the letters: 1:L, 2:E, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R.

  Now, we know E is at position 4. If there is an E at position 2, that would be a second E? And we have not tested position 2 for E? In the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but not there, so the secret has at least one E. In the second guess, we had E at position 4 correct. If there is a second E at position 2, that's possible? But in the feedback for ""tiger"", we had no E at position 2? ""tiger"" had I at position 2, which was absent. So we don't know about position 2.

  But in ""LEPER"", we have E at position 2. Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not there. That E could be the one at position 2? Or the one at position 4? Since we only guessed one E, the feedback marks one occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we still only get one mark for the E we guessed? So it's possible.

  Similarly, for ""power"", we had no E at position 1? But we had E at position 4 correct.

  So ""LEPER"" is also a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SEVER"": S,E,V,E,R -> but E at position 2 and 4? And V not eliminated. But ""SEVER"" ends with E,R? S,E,V,E,R -> positions: 1:S,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R -> so position 4 is E, position 5 is R? Yes.

  But we have E at position 2? So two E's.

  And ""BEVER""? Not common.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER, LEPER, SEVER, etc.

  But we need to use the fact that in ""power"", P is present but not at position 1. In LEPER and SEVER, there is no P? So they don't have P? But we know P is in the word! From ""power"", P is present.

  Therefore, LEPER and SEVER do not have P, so they are invalid.

  So only candidates with P: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  And we must have P in the word.

  So the secret word must be one of: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  Now, we need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish.

  We have 3 possibilities. We can guess one of them.

  But note: we have to make a guess that is a valid word and uses only available letters.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first three positions with new letters to narrow down.

  But since we have only three candidates, we can guess one.

  Let's see the letters:

  - SUPER: S, U, P, E, R
  - HYPER: H, Y, P, E, R
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R

  We can try to guess a word that includes S, U, H, Y, or double P to distinguish.

  But we also have to avoid eliminated letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"" directly.

  Or, to get more information, we might guess a word that has, say, S and H? But we don't know.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are at the fourth guess, we can try ""SUPER"".

  But if we guess ""SUPER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback that might help.

  Similarly, we can guess ""HUMPH"" or something, but that doesn't fit the pattern? We have to have E at 4 and R at 5.

  We must guess a word that has E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed.

  So our guess must be of the form _ _ _ E R.

  And we want to test the first three letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"": which is one of the candidates.

  Or we can guess ""HYPER"".

  Or we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests other letters? But we don't have many letters left.

  For example, we can guess ""SAMER"" but A is absent? Not.

  ""SIZER"" has I and Z? I absent.

  ""SYRUP"": S,Y,R,U,P -> but doesn't end with E R? We need position 4 to be E, but in SYRUP: S,Y,R,U,P -> position 4 is U, not E.

  So we cannot guess a word that doesn't have E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed, so we must use them to get information about the first three.

  Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""SUPER"" as it is a common word.

  But note: in ""SUPER"", we have S at position 1, U at 2, P at 3.

  If the secret is ""HYPER"", then in ""SUPER"":
    - S at position 1: would be absent? Because HYPER has H at 1, not S.
    - U at position 2: absent? HYPER has Y at 2.
    - P at position 3: present and correct? Both SUPER and HYPER have P at 3? So it would be ✓ for P? And E and R ✓.

  So feedback would be: S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know it's not SUPER, and we have two candidates left: HYPER and UPPER.

  Then we can guess HYPER next.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""UPPER"", then:
    - S at 1: absent? UPPER has U at 1? So S is not in the word? But UPPER has no S, so S would be x.
    - U at 2: in UPPER, position 2 is P, not U? So U would be absent? Or present? U is in UPPER at position 1? But we are guessing U at position 2. So U is in the word but not at position 2? Then U would be marked as '-'.

  Let's simulate:

  Secret: UPPER (U,P,P,E,R)
  Guess: SUPER (S,U,P,E,R)

  Feedback:
    - Position 1: S vs U -> S is not in the word? UPPER has no S -> x
    - Position 2: U vs P -> U is in the word? U is at position 1 in secret, so U is present but not at position 2 -> '-'
    - Position 3: P vs P -> ✓
    - Position 4: E vs E -> ✓
    - Position 5: R vs R -> ✓

  So feedback: S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know U is in the word but not at position 2. And since we know the word has E at 4 and R at 5, and P at 3, then the word must be UPPER? Because the only candidate with P at 3 and U present is UPPER? And U must be at position 1? Because we have position 1 open.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""HYPER"", we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) meaning the first two are wrong and P is at 3, so then the word must be HYPER? But what about UPPER? In this case, we got U as absent? So UPPER would have U, so if we got U absent, then UPPER is eliminated? 

  In the feedback for ""SUPER"" when secret is ""HYPER"":
    - S: not in HYPER -> x
    - U: not in HYPER -> x
    - P: in position 3 -> ✓
    - E: ✓
    - R: ✓

  So U is marked x, meaning not in the word. Therefore, UPPER has U, so it would be eliminated? Because if U is not in the word, then UPPER cannot be the word.

  So by guessing ""SUPER"", we can distinguish:

  - If we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is HYPER (since UPPER has U and would not be possible).
  - If we get S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is UPPER (because U is present but not at position 2, and HYPER would have given U as absent).
  - If we get all ✓ except maybe the first two, but if it's SUPER, we get all ✓.

  So it's a good guess.

  Alternatively, we could guess ""HYPER"" or ""UPPER"" directly.

  But to save a guess, we can guess ""SUPER"".

  However, we have three candidates, and we are at guess 4.

  Let's guess ""SUPER"".

  If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us which of the other two it is.

  So I think ""SUPER"" is a good guess.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""SUPER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, A, N are absent; R and E are present but in wrong positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- **Guess 2 (tiger)**: T, I, G are absent; E is correct at position 4; R is correct at position 5.
- **Guess 3 (power)**: O and W are absent; P is present but not in position 1; E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**: 
  - Position 4 = E (from ""tiger"" ✓).
  - Position 5 = R (from ""tiger"" ✓).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters**:
  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""power"" -).
- **Word Pattern**: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as E and R).
- P must be in position 2 or 3 (since it cannot be in position 1 and is not in positions 4–5).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must include P (in position 2 or 3) and exclude all absent letters.
- Possible candidates (valid English words fitting `_ _ _ E R` with P in position 2 or 3):
  - **SUPER**: Positions: S (1), U (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **HYPER**: Positions: H (1), Y (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **UPPER**: Positions: U (1), P (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
- **Strategy**: Guess **SUPER** to test the candidates:
  - If correct, the game ends.
  - If incorrect, feedback on S and U will distinguish between HYPER and UPPER:
    - If S and U are absent (x), the word is **HYPER** (since UPPER requires U).
    - If U is present but wrong position (-), the word is **UPPER** (SUPER's U at position 2 would be misplaced if UPPER has U at position 1).

This guess maximizes information gain by leveraging the fixed E and R positions and testing P in position 3 while probing two key candidates (SUPER and UPPER) in one move.",Guess 4: super -> FEEDBACK: S(x) U(-) P(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position (as in ""crane""), and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Includes R and E (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions.
2. Avoids using C, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

We also note that the word is 5 letters.

Let's think of words that have R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and without C, A, N.

Possible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet, such as T, O, I, S, L, etc.

One common strategy is to try a word that puts R and E in new positions and includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with R at the beginning? But note: we don't know if R is at the beginning. However, we can try.

Example: ""ROUSE"" - but let's check:
  R is in position 1 (which is different from position 2) and E is in position 5? But wait, in the feedback, E was in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it's not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.

Actually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it's not there.

Similarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.

Therefore, in ""ROUSE"":
  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)
  O, U, S are new letters.
  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it's not. That would be a waste because we already know that. We want to test E in a new position (1,2,3,4).

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Another candidate: ""TRIED""
  T: new
  R: at position 1 (was at 2 in first guess, so new position) -> okay
  I: new
  E: at position 4 (was at 5, now at 4) -> new position, so we can test if E is at 4.
  D: new

But note: we also have to avoid A, C, N. This word doesn't have them.

Another: ""PRICE"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""DRIVE"" -> D, I, V are new. R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it's not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient because we already know it's not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.

In ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.

How about ""RIVET"":
  R at 1 (new position)
  I, V, T new
  E at 4 (new position)

This seems good.

Another: ""ROBES""
  R at 1
  O, B, S new
  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

Another: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

Another: ""STORE""
  S, T, O new
  R at position 3? (new position, since previously at 2) -> okay
  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.

We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

Let me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).

For example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.

E at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don't know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.

E at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.

E at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.

Another with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.

Another: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2? In ""FRIED"", R is at position 2 -> we avoid because we know R is not at position 2.

How about ""WROTE"": 
  W, R, O, T, E -> R at position 2? Again, same problem.

We need R not at position 2.

So let's try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.

For example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.

""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.

""RIPED""? Not a word.

""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.

""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.

So let's go with ""RIVET"".

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it's acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.

""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.

""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""TIGER"": 
  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.

This seems good: ""TIGER"".

We avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.

And we test T, I, G.

So ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.

""LIVER"": 
  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.

But T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.

I think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.

But note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.

So I'll go with ""TIGER"".

Let me confirm: 
  T: new
  I: new
  G: new
  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)
  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.
- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).
- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.
- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:
  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).
  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).
  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.

This guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. **First guess: crane**
   - C: x (not in the word)
   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
   - A: x (not in the word)
   - N: x (not in the word)
   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)

2. **Second guess: tiger**
   - T: x (not in the word)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - G: x (not in the word)
   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)
   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)

From this, we can deduce:
- **Confirmed letters and positions:**
   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).
   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).

- **Absent letters:** 
   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).

- **Known letters in the word:** 
   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5). Now we see that in the second guess, E is at position 4 and R is at position 5, both correct. So these are confirmed.

- **Word structure:**
   - Position 1: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 2: unknown (but not R, and not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 3: unknown (but not C, A, N, T, I, G)
   - Position 4: E (confirmed)
   - Position 5: R (confirmed)

We need to find a 5-letter word that has:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
  - And the first three letters must be any letters except C, A, N, T, I, G (which are ruled out).
  - Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has an R and an E (already satisfied) and must have the R not in position 2 (but it is in position 5, so fine).

Moreover, in the first guess, ""crane"" had R in position 2 and E in position 5, and both were marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E R

We need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.

We also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.

Now, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.

Common 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it's _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.

Possible words could be:
  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).
  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.
  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R
  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R
  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R
  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.
  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.
  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.

But we have to see:

We must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So let's think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.

Also note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.

But in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.

For our current purpose, we need to think of common words.

We have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.

The letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.

So eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Remaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.

Common vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).

Consonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

Possible words:
  - POWER: P O W E R
  - LOWER: L O W E R
  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)
  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.
  - HOVER: H O V E R
  - MOVER: M O V E R
  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.

Other words:
  - SOWER: S O W E R
  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.
  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are 'ER'.

What about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.

But we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: E   (but we don't know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as '-', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.

However, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.

Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked '-'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven't tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.

According to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E's, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got '-', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.

To avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.

Moreover, we have only two guesses so far.

But for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.

We have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But if the secret word is FEWER, then:
- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn't test position 2 for E because we had I there.

Actually, in ""tiger"" we tested:
  Position 1: T -> x
  Position 2: I -> x
  Position 3: G -> x
  Position 4: E -> ✓
  Position 5: R -> ✓

So for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.

So it would fit.

However, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": 
  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)

In FEWER:
  Position 2: E (was R in crane's guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that's fine.
  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked '-'? For E to be marked '-' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn't guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn't guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E's, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one '-' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we would still get one '-' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one '-' or '✓' appropriately.

Therefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.

But FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.

However, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.

We must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.

We have:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} 
  Position 2: similarly
  Position 3: similarly
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

And the word must be valid.

For our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.

We can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.

We want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.

Proposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.

For example, ""POWER"": 
  P: unknown
  O: unknown
  W: unknown
  E: known at position 4
  R: known at position 5

But note: we might get very informative feedback.

Another option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R

But perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.

We know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Therefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.

We might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don't have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.

So let's think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.

Or ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.

But let me list possible words:

Words ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: 
  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:

We can think of:
  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.
  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.
  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.

Similarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).

""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.

But note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But we haven't tested F.

To get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.

For example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.

Similarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.

Or ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn't in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked 'x', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.

""BOZER""? Not common.

Another: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.

How about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.

And S,O,B are new.

Similarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.

""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.

But we don't know.

Since we have to guess, let's choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.

But note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven't been tested.

Specifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.

We have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Common letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.

We might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.

For example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R

But we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:

- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.

But note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.

There might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.

But we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.

Let us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.

Perhaps we choose a word that has O since it's a common vowel.

Another issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked '-', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it's at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked '-' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.

So no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn't indicate that there are multiple. The '-' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.

So we assume only one R and one E? Because we found them: R at 5, E at 4.

If there were multiple, we might see feedback indicating more? Not necessarily. So we shall guess assuming that E and R occur only once for now.

For example, let's assume the secret word has exactly one E and one R.

Then, for POWER: P, O, W : no conflict.

Similarly, LOVER: L, O, V; etc.

So let's choose ""POWER"" because we can test P, O, W.

Therefore, we guess ""POWER"".

Let me summarize:

- We know positions 4 and 5 are E and R.
- The secret word must have: letter1 = ?, letter2 = ?, letter3 = ?, letter4=E, letter5=R.
- We need a word using letters not ruled out (C,A,N,T,I,G) for the first three positions.

""POWER"" uses P (not used), O (not used), W (not used), and E and R known.

So it's a valid guess.

<guess>power</guess>Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:

1. **Known Correct Positions**:  
   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""tiger"").  
   - R is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").  

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"") and T, I, G (from ""tiger"") are not in the word.  

3. **Previous Guesses**:  
   - ""crane"": R is in the word but not position 2 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-). This is consistent since we now have E at position 4 and R at position 5.  

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`, where the first three letters must be:
- Letters **not** in {C, A, N, T, I, G}.  
- Possible common letters include B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

For this guess, **""POWER""** is chosen because:
- It tests three new common letters (P, O, W) for positions 1, 2, and 3.  
- It avoids repeating eliminated letters and leverages the known E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
- If the guess is incorrect, the feedback for P, O, and W will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three positions.  

This approach maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.

<guess>power</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: power -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. **tiger**: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - T, I, G are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4.
   - R is correct at position 5.

3. **power**: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - P is in the word but not in position 1 (since it's marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).
   - O and W are not in the word.
   - E is correct at position 4 (already known).
   - R is correct at position 5 (already known).

From this, we can deduce:

- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R

- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W
  - Total absent: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W

- **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
  - R and E were already placed (positions 5 and 4 respectively).
  - P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""power"" feedback).

Also, from the first guess, we knew R and E were present, which are now placed.

So the secret word has:
- P in it, but not at position 1.
- And the known positions: 4=E, 5=R.

The word pattern: _ _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1 cannot be P (because in ""power"", P at position 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but not at position 1). So P must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W.

So the available letters for positions 1,2,3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding these.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and P is in the word, so must be used in position 2 or 3).

But note: we must include P in the word at position 2 or 3.

Now, we need to form a word that fits: [letter1][letter2][letter3] E R

With:
- letter1: not P, and not in {C,A,N,T,I,G,O,W}
- letter2: could be P or another letter, but P must be in the word at position 2 or 3.
- letter3: similarly.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:

We know P is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3.

Case 1: P at position 2: then the word is _ P _ E R

Case 2: P at position 3: then the word is _ _ P E R

We can think of common words:

For case 2: _ _ P E R
  Examples: UPPER (but U and P, but U is allowed? But we have two P's? The word UPPER has two P's? U, P, P, E, R -> so positions: 1:U, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. But we have P at position 2 and 3? However, in our feedback, we only know that P is present (at least one occurrence) and not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at position 2 and 3. But we don't know if there are multiple P's.

But note: in the guess ""power"", we had only one P (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one P. If the secret has two P's, that's fine, but we only get one mark for the P we guessed? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence? In Wordle, if the secret has two of a letter and you guess one, you get one mark. If you guess two and the secret has two, both get marked appropriately.

But in our case, we only guessed one P, so we know there is at least one P, but there could be more.

Similarly, for UPPER: it has P at positions 2 and 3.

But we also have to check the absent letters: O and W are absent, and U is not absent? We haven't tested U.

But let's list possible words.

First, for pattern _ _ P E R:
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but we have two P's? And U is a vowel.
  - SUPPER: S,U,P,P,E,R -> 6 letters? No, SUPPER is 6? S-U-P-P-E-R -> 6 letters. Not 5.
  - PAPER: P,A,P,E,R -> but A is absent (from first guess), so invalid.
  - CAPER: C,A,P,E,R -> C and A absent, invalid.
  - TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> T and A absent.
  - VIPER: V,I,P,E,R -> I absent.
  - RIPER: not common, and R is already at position 5? But R is at 5, so position 1 cannot be R? We don't know, but in this pattern, position 1 is not P, so it could be R? But we have R at position 5, and if there is another R? But we don't know.

Actually, we don't have information about multiple R's. In the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position, and in the second guess, R at position 5 is correct. So if the secret has only one R, then that R is at position 5. If it has two, then there might be another R.

But in the pattern _ _ P E R, if we put R at position 1, then the word is R _ P E R, which would have two R's? For example, ""RIPER"" is not a word. ""RAPER"" has A, invalid. ""ROPER"" has O, which is absent (from power: O is x). ""RUPER"" not a word.

So perhaps no common words with R at position 1 and P at position 3.

Other words for _ _ P E R:
  - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> fits. And S and U are not eliminated.
  - DUPER: D,U,P,E,R -> also possible, but less common.
  - JUPER: not a word.
  - LOPER: L,O,P,E,R -> but O is absent (from power: O is x).
  - MOPER: M,O,P,E,R -> O absent.
  - HOPER: H,O,P,E,R -> O absent.

So ""SUPER"" is a candidate.

Now, case 1: P at position 2: pattern _ P _ E R
  Examples:
    - UPPER: but that has P at position 2 and 3? So it fits both patterns? Actually, in UPPER, P is at 2 and 3, so it would be _ P _ E R with the third letter being P? But the pattern is _ P _ E R, meaning position 2 is P, position 3 is something else? In UPPER, position 3 is P, so it's the same as the second pattern? Let me write:
        U P P E R -> position 2 is P, position 3 is P. So for pattern _ P _ E R, the third position is P? But then it's not a different letter.

  But we can have words where position 2 is P and position 3 is not P.

  For example:
    - APTER: A,P,T,E,R -> A and T absent.
    - OPTER: O,P,T,E,R -> O and T absent.
    - SPHER: not a word.
    - SPIER: S,P,I,E,R -> I absent.
    - SPEER: S,P,E,E,R -> but E at position 3? Then we have E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E, so if position 3 is E, that would be a repeated E? And in the feedback, we have E at position 4 correct, but we don't know about other E's.

  However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If there is another E at position 3, that would be possible? But let's see the feedback for E in the first guess: we had one E guessed and it was marked as present but not at position 5. If the secret has two E's, that's fine, but we only got one mark for E in the first guess? Actually, the feedback would only mark one E as present (the first occurrence that isn't matched?).

  But to avoid complexity, let's list:

  For _ P _ E R:
    - SUPER is not, because SUPER has P at position 3.
    - PAPER: invalid.
    - Perhaps ""SPEER""? But SPEER is a proper name? Not common.
    - ""UPPER"" has P at 2 and 3, so it fits _ P _ E R? Yes, but the third letter is P, so it's _ P P E R.

  But we also have ""UPPER"" as a candidate for the other pattern.

  Another: ""OPERA"" is 5 letters? O-P-E-R-A -> but that ends with A, not E R? We need to end with E R.

  How about ""SPERM"": S,P,E,R,M -> but that ends with M, not R? Positions: 1:S,2:P,3:E,4:R,5:M -> but we need position 4 to be E and 5 to be R? So not.

  ""SPERT"" not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for _ P _ E R is ""UPPER"", but that has P at position 3 as well.

  Alternatively, ""APRES"" is a word? A-P-R-E-S -> but ends with S, not R? And A is absent.

  So let's focus on the pattern with P at position 3: _ _ P E R

  We have ""SUPER"" as a candidate.

  Also, ""DUPER"" (if accepted), ""HYPER"" (H,Y,P,E,R) -> H and Y not eliminated.

  ""HYPER"" is a common word.

  ""JAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""VAPER"" has A, invalid.

  ""PIPER"" has I, invalid.

  ""MOPED"" doesn't end with ER.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER (which has two P's).

  Now, from the feedback of ""power"", we have P marked as present but not at position 1. In ""SUPER"", P is at position 3. In ""HYPER"", P is at position 3. In ""UPPER"", P is at positions 2 and 3.

  Also, we have to consider that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 must not be one of the absent letters.

  For SUPER: position 1 is S, which is not eliminated.
  For HYPER: position 1 is H, not eliminated.
  For UPPER: position 1 is U, not eliminated.

  But we have more information: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position. Now we know R is at position 5. So if the secret word has only one R, then there is no R at position 2. But if it has two R's, then position 2 could be R? But in our candidates, none of them have R at position 2? 
    - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - HYPER: H,Y,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.
    - UPPER: U,P,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.

  So that's consistent.

  Now, we need to make a guess that can distinguish between these or get the word.

  We also have to consider other possibilities? For example, P might be at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word for _ P _ E R without the third letter being P? So maybe UPPER is the only one? But UPPER has P at both 2 and 3.

  Another possibility: the word might have P at position 2 and a different letter at 3? For example, ""SPEAR"": S,P,E,A,R -> but A is absent? And also, position 3 is E? But we have position 4 as E, so if position 3 is E, then we have two E's? And in ""SPEAR"", the E is at position 3 and A at 4? But we need position 4 to be E? So not.

  ""SPEED"" ends with D, not R.

  So perhaps the main candidates are SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER.

  We also have to consider that in the pattern _ _ P E R, the first two letters can be other combinations.

  For example, ""LEPER"": L,E,P,E,R -> but E at position 2? Then we have E at position 2 and 4? And L is not eliminated. But in ""LEPER"", the letters: 1:L, 2:E, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R.

  Now, we know E is at position 4. If there is an E at position 2, that would be a second E? And we have not tested position 2 for E? In the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but not there, so the secret has at least one E. In the second guess, we had E at position 4 correct. If there is a second E at position 2, that's possible? But in the feedback for ""tiger"", we had no E at position 2? ""tiger"" had I at position 2, which was absent. So we don't know about position 2.

  But in ""LEPER"", we have E at position 2. Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not there. That E could be the one at position 2? Or the one at position 4? Since we only guessed one E, the feedback marks one occurrence. So if the secret has two E's, we still only get one mark for the E we guessed? So it's possible.

  Similarly, for ""power"", we had no E at position 1? But we had E at position 4 correct.

  So ""LEPER"" is also a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SEVER"": S,E,V,E,R -> but E at position 2 and 4? And V not eliminated. But ""SEVER"" ends with E,R? S,E,V,E,R -> positions: 1:S,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R -> so position 4 is E, position 5 is R? Yes.

  But we have E at position 2? So two E's.

  And ""BEVER""? Not common.

  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER, LEPER, SEVER, etc.

  But we need to use the fact that in ""power"", P is present but not at position 1. In LEPER and SEVER, there is no P? So they don't have P? But we know P is in the word! From ""power"", P is present.

  Therefore, LEPER and SEVER do not have P, so they are invalid.

  So only candidates with P: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  And we must have P in the word.

  So the secret word must be one of: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.

  Now, we need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish.

  We have 3 possibilities. We can guess one of them.

  But note: we have to make a guess that is a valid word and uses only available letters.

  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first three positions with new letters to narrow down.

  But since we have only three candidates, we can guess one.

  Let's see the letters:

  - SUPER: S, U, P, E, R
  - HYPER: H, Y, P, E, R
  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R

  We can try to guess a word that includes S, U, H, Y, or double P to distinguish.

  But we also have to avoid eliminated letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"" directly.

  Or, to get more information, we might guess a word that has, say, S and H? But we don't know.

  Since we have limited guesses, and we are at the fourth guess, we can try ""SUPER"".

  But if we guess ""SUPER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback that might help.

  Similarly, we can guess ""HUMPH"" or something, but that doesn't fit the pattern? We have to have E at 4 and R at 5.

  We must guess a word that has E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed.

  So our guess must be of the form _ _ _ E R.

  And we want to test the first three letters.

  We can guess ""SUPER"": which is one of the candidates.

  Or we can guess ""HYPER"".

  Or we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests other letters? But we don't have many letters left.

  For example, we can guess ""SAMER"" but A is absent? Not.

  ""SIZER"" has I and Z? I absent.

  ""SYRUP"": S,Y,R,U,P -> but doesn't end with E R? We need position 4 to be E, but in SYRUP: S,Y,R,U,P -> position 4 is U, not E.

  So we cannot guess a word that doesn't have E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed, so we must use them to get information about the first three.

  Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.

  Let's choose ""SUPER"" as it is a common word.

  But note: in ""SUPER"", we have S at position 1, U at 2, P at 3.

  If the secret is ""HYPER"", then in ""SUPER"":
    - S at position 1: would be absent? Because HYPER has H at 1, not S.
    - U at position 2: absent? HYPER has Y at 2.
    - P at position 3: present and correct? Both SUPER and HYPER have P at 3? So it would be ✓ for P? And E and R ✓.

  So feedback would be: S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know it's not SUPER, and we have two candidates left: HYPER and UPPER.

  Then we can guess HYPER next.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""UPPER"", then:
    - S at 1: absent? UPPER has U at 1? So S is not in the word? But UPPER has no S, so S would be x.
    - U at 2: in UPPER, position 2 is P, not U? So U would be absent? Or present? U is in UPPER at position 1? But we are guessing U at position 2. So U is in the word but not at position 2? Then U would be marked as '-'.

  Let's simulate:

  Secret: UPPER (U,P,P,E,R)
  Guess: SUPER (S,U,P,E,R)

  Feedback:
    - Position 1: S vs U -> S is not in the word? UPPER has no S -> x
    - Position 2: U vs P -> U is in the word? U is at position 1 in secret, so U is present but not at position 2 -> '-'
    - Position 3: P vs P -> ✓
    - Position 4: E vs E -> ✓
    - Position 5: R vs R -> ✓

  So feedback: S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

  Then we know U is in the word but not at position 2. And since we know the word has E at 4 and R at 5, and P at 3, then the word must be UPPER? Because the only candidate with P at 3 and U present is UPPER? And U must be at position 1? Because we have position 1 open.

  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""HYPER"", we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) meaning the first two are wrong and P is at 3, so then the word must be HYPER? But what about UPPER? In this case, we got U as absent? So UPPER would have U, so if we got U absent, then UPPER is eliminated? 

  In the feedback for ""SUPER"" when secret is ""HYPER"":
    - S: not in HYPER -> x
    - U: not in HYPER -> x
    - P: in position 3 -> ✓
    - E: ✓
    - R: ✓

  So U is marked x, meaning not in the word. Therefore, UPPER has U, so it would be eliminated? Because if U is not in the word, then UPPER cannot be the word.

  So by guessing ""SUPER"", we can distinguish:

  - If we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is HYPER (since UPPER has U and would not be possible).
  - If we get S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is UPPER (because U is present but not at position 2, and HYPER would have given U as absent).
  - If we get all ✓ except maybe the first two, but if it's SUPER, we get all ✓.

  So it's a good guess.

  Alternatively, we could guess ""HYPER"" or ""UPPER"" directly.

  But to save a guess, we can guess ""SUPER"".

  However, we have three candidates, and we are at guess 4.

  Let's guess ""SUPER"".

  If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us which of the other two it is.

  So I think ""SUPER"" is a good guess.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""SUPER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, A, N are absent; R and E are present but in wrong positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- **Guess 2 (tiger)**: T, I, G are absent; E is correct at position 4; R is correct at position 5.
- **Guess 3 (power)**: O and W are absent; P is present but not in position 1; E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**: 
  - Position 4 = E (from ""tiger"" ✓).
  - Position 5 = R (from ""tiger"" ✓).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W (cannot be in the word).
- **Present Letters**:
  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""power"" -).
- **Word Pattern**: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as E and R).
- P must be in position 2 or 3 (since it cannot be in position 1 and is not in positions 4–5).

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word must include P (in position 2 or 3) and exclude all absent letters.
- Possible candidates (valid English words fitting `_ _ _ E R` with P in position 2 or 3):
  - **SUPER**: Positions: S (1), U (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **HYPER**: Positions: H (1), Y (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
  - **UPPER**: Positions: U (1), P (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).
- **Strategy**: Guess **SUPER** to test the candidates:
  - If correct, the game ends.
  - If incorrect, feedback on S and U will distinguish between HYPER and UPPER:
    - If S and U are absent (x), the word is **HYPER** (since UPPER requires U).
    - If U is present but wrong position (-), the word is **UPPER** (SUPER's U at position 2 would be misplaced if UPPER has U at position 1).

This guess maximizes information gain by leveraging the fixed E and R positions and testing P in position 3 while probing two key candidates (SUPER and UPPER) in one move.

Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nWe also note that the word is 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and without C, A, N.\n\nPossible positions for R: it cannot be in position 2.

But note: we don\'t know if R is at the beginning. However, we can try.\n\nExample: ""ROUSE"" - but let\'s check:\n  R is in position 1 (which is different from position 2) and E is in position 5? But wait, in the feedback, E was in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 again, that would be invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess E was not at position 5, but it might be at position 5 in the secret word? No, because the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E at position 5 again, and if the secret word has E at position 5, then we would get a ""✓"", but if not, we get another ""-"" or maybe even an ""x"" if it\'s not there? But we know E is in the word, so it must be in one of the other positions.\n\nActually, we know E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, in the secret word, E must be in positions 1,2,3, or 4. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 in our next guess because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, R is not at position 2, so we should avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nTherefore, in ""ROUSE"":\n  R is at position 1 -> okay (new position)\n  O, U, S are new letters.\n  E is at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5, so we are putting it in a position we know it\'s not.

Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know it\'s not there. In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we can, but it\'s inefficient because we already know it\'s not at position 2. So we should try R in a different position.\n\nIn ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 -> same as before, so we avoid.\n\nHow about ""RIVET"":\n  R at 1 (new position)\n  I, V, T new\n  E at 4 (new position)\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother: ""ROBES""\n  R at 1\n  O, B, S new\n  E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\nAnother: ""RESIN"" -> but N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word).

(new position, since previously at 2) -> okay\n  E at position 5 -> avoid because we know E is not at 5.\n\nWe need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\nLet me try to think of words with E in position 1,2,3, or 4 and R in position 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).\n\nFor example, E at position 1: ""EARTH"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So invalid.\n\nE at position 2: ""LEMON"" -> but L, M, O are new, but N is not allowed and also we have O. But wait, we don\'t know about O. However, we have to avoid A, C, N. So ""LEMON"" has N -> invalid.\n\nE at position 3: ""HORSE"" -> H, O, S new, but E is at position 5? No, in ""HORSE"", the letters are H, O, R, S, E -> so E is at position 5. Avoid.\n\nE at position 4: ""TRIED"" as I thought earlier.\n\nAnother with E at 4: ""CRIED"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""FRIED"" -> F, R, I, E, D. R is at position 2?

Again, same problem.\n\nWe need R not at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to put R at position 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nFor example, R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPER""? Not a word. ""RIDER""? But E is not in it. We need E.\n\n""RIPEN"" -> has N, invalid.\n\n""RIPED""? Not a word.\n\n""RIVET"": as I thought earlier. R at 1, E at 4.\n\n""RIVET"" is a word: meaning a short metal screw or bolt.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""RIVET"".\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters. But ""RIVET"" uses R, I, V, E, T. V is not very common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROUTE"" -> but E at 5, avoid.\n\n""RISEN"" -> has N and S, but N is invalid.\n\n""ROBES"" -> E at 5, avoid.\n\n""TIGER"": \n  T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n  R is at position 5 (new) and E at position 4 (new). Also, T, I, G are new.\n\nThis seems good: ""TIGER"".\n\nWe avoid the known bad positions: R was at 2, now at 5; E was at 5, now at 4.\n\nAnd we test T, I, G.\n\nSo ""TIGER"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""POWER"" -> E at 5, avoid.\n\n""LIVER"": \n  L at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> same as TIGER but with L and V instead of T and G.\n\nBut T and G are more common than L and V? Actually, in word games, T is very common.\n\nI think ""TIGER"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we also know that the secret word has R and E, and we are including them in new positions.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TIGER"".\n\nLet me confirm: \n  T: new\n  I: new\n  G: new\n  E: at position 4 (previously at 5, so new position)\n  R: at position 5 (previously at 2, so new position)\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""TIGER"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5.\n- Exclude C, A, and N (known absent letters).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G, S, L, O) to gather more information.\n- ""TIGER"" is chosen because:\n  - It places R in position 5 (new position, not tested before).\n  - It places E in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).\n  - It introduces T, I, and G (common letters not yet tested).\n  - It avoids C, A, N, and reuses R and E efficiently.\n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing new positions for known letters and adding three new letters.\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. **First guess: crane**\n   - C: x (not in the word)\n   - R: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)\n   - A: x (not in the word)\n   - N: x (not in the word)\n   - E: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 5)\n\n2. **Second guess: tiger**\n   - T: x (not in the word)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - G: x (not in the word)\n   - E: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 4)\n   - R: ✓ (correct letter and in correct position; position 5)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- **Confirmed letters and positions:**\n   - E is in position 4 (because in ""tiger"", E got a checkmark at position 4).\n   - R is in position 5 (because in ""tiger"", R got a checkmark at position 5).\n\n- **Absent letters:** \n   - C, A, N, T, I, G are not in the secret word (all marked x in any attempt).\n\n- **Known letters in the word:** \n   - From the first guess, we know R is in the word (but not position 2) and E is in the word (but not position 5).

Since we now know E is in position 4 (not 5) and R is in position 5 (not 2), that is consistent.\n\nSo the secret word is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe need to fill the first three blanks with letters that are not in the set {C, A, N, T, I, G}.\n\nWe also have to ensure that any letter we guess is not one of the eliminated ones.\n\nNow, we look for possible words. We need a word ending in ""ER"", but the last two are E and R.\n\nCommon 5-letter words ending with ER: remember, it\'s _ _ _ E R, so the last two letters are fixed.\n\nPossible words could be:\n  - like ""LIVER"": L, I, V, E, R -> but I is ruled out (we know I is not in the word from guess 2).\n  - ""POWER"": P, O, W, E, R -> but O and W are possible since not ruled out.\n  - ""LOWER"": L, O, W, E, R\n  - ""BOXER"": B, O, X, E, R\n  - ""JOKER"": J, O, K, E, R\n  - ""MAKER"": M, A, K, E, R -> A is ruled out.\n  - ""BAKER"": B, A, K, E, R -> A ruled out.\n  - ""FEWER"": F, E, W, E, R -> but note, we have E at the second position? The word is F, E, W, E, R. However, we know position 4 is E, so the E at position 2 is not necessarily the same E? Actually, double E is possible.\n\nBut we have to see:\n\nWe must avoid letters we know are not present: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that start with three letters that are not blocked.\n\nAlso note: we are not constrained by the rules of having unique letters? Actually, the game allows repeated letters.\n\nBut in the feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might matter.\n\nFor our current purpose, we need to think of common words.\n\nWe have 6 letters ruled out: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nThe letters we have used so far: crane: C,R,A,N,E; tiger: T,I,G,E,R.\n\nSo eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nRemaining letters: We should focus on untested common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon vowels: O, U (since A,I are out? A and I are vowels, but ruled out. So vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y).\n\nConsonants left: many: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words: _ _ _ E R\n\nPossible words:\n  - POWER: P O W E R\n  - LOWER: L O W E R\n  - BOXER: B O X E R   (but X might be rare)\n  - COVER: C O V E R -> but C is ruled out.\n  - HOVER: H O V E R\n  - MOVER: M O V E R\n  - ROBE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROBER is not a word. It must be 5 letters.\n\nOther words:\n  - SOWER: S O W E R\n  - TOWER: T O W E R -> but T is ruled out.\n  - ROWED? Not ending in ER? We need E at position 4 and R at 5: so the last two are \'ER\'.\n\nWhat about words with U? FEWER, but E at position 2: F,E,W,E,R.\n\nBut we have E at position 4. So if the word is FEWER, then:\n  Position 1: F\n  Position 2: E   (but we don\'t know if E can be repeated? And from the first guess, the E was at position 5 which is now known not to be E, but in this word position 5 is R, which is fixed. So if E is at position 2, then in the first guess ""crane"", the E was at position 5 and marked as \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not position 5. If E is repeated, then it might have two Es? The feedback would account for each occurrence? In Wordle rules, if a letter is repeated, the feedback is handled by the occurrences. For example, if the word has one E, but we guessed two, the second one might be grey.\n\nHowever, in this case, for the secret word FEWER: it has one E? Actually, FEWER has two Es: at position 2 and 4? Positions: 1-F,2-E,3-W,4-E,5-R -> two Es.\n\nNow, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E only at position 5 (and it was marked \'-\'), meaning there is at least one E in the word. That would be satisfied by the E at position 4 (or at 2). Then in the second guess ""tiger"", we had E at position 4 marked \'✓\', which would be the E at position 4 in FEWER. The E at position 2 is still present, but we haven\'t tested it. Since the rule is that we only mark letters that are in the secret word, but repeated letters are tricky.\n\nAccording to standard feedback rules: For a secret word with two E\'s, if the guess has an E in a correct position, it gets a ✓. If the guess has an E in the wrong position but the secret has multiple, it depends. But in our feedback so far, we have only one E given: in ""tiger"", position 4 was ✓, so the secret has at least one E at position 4. If there is a second E, it might have been tested? On the other hand, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and got \'-\', meaning the secret has an E (though not at 5). That E could be the same E at position 4, because Wordle would mark the single E as being present but not at that position? Actually, only one E in the secret word? Or multiple.\n\nTo avoid complexity, we shall not assume repeated letters until we have evidence.\n\nMoreover, we have only two guesses so far.\n\nBut for FEWER: the letters are F, E, W, E, R.\n\nWe have not tested F or W. And we know E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut if the secret word is FEWER, then:\n- In ""tiger"" at position 2: we had I (which got x). In FEWER, position 2 is E, so we correctly have E at 4 but not at position 2? The guess ""tiger"" didn\'t test position 2 for E because we had I there.\n\nActually, in ""tiger"" we tested:\n  Position 1: T -> x\n  Position 2: I -> x\n  Position 3: G -> x\n  Position 4: E -> ✓\n  Position 5: R -> ✓\n\nSo for FEWER, T would not be in the word, so T -> x is correct. I -> x, correct. G -> x, correct. E at 4 ✓, R at 5 ✓.\n\nSo it would fit.\n\nHowever, we also have the feedback from ""crane"": \n  crane: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n\nIn FEWER:\n  Position 2: E (was R in crane\'s guess) -> R was guessed at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. In FEWER, R is at position 5, so that\'s fine.\n  E at position 5 (guessed) but in FEWER? FEWER has E at position 2 and 4? Position 5 is R, not E. So crane guessed E at position 5: no E at position 5 in FEWER? Then how was it marked \'-\'? For E to be marked \'-\' in ""crane"", there must be an E in the word that we didn\'t guess at a correct position. In FEWER, the Es are at positions 2 and 4. Position 4 wasn\'t guessed? In ""crane"", we guessed E at position 5. Since the secret has E at positions 2 and 4, then one E (we can think of) is accounted for: the feedback would mark one E as present but not at position 5. The other E might not be marked because the feedback only accounts for multiple letters if the guess has multiple? Officially, the rule is: The number of marks is based on the frequency. If the secret has two E\'s, then it can mark two E guesses. But in ""crane"", we had only one E, so it gets one \'-\' for one E occurrence. So if the secret has two E\'s, we would still get one \'-\' since we guessed one E. Similarly, for R: we have one R guessed and one R in the secret, so one \'-\' or \'✓\' appropriately.\n\nTherefore, FEWER is a possibility? But we have E at position 4 confirmed, and we know E is in the word but not at 5 (as per first guess), which holds because in FEWER, E is at 2 and 4.\n\nBut FEWER has E at position 2, which is untested so far? Yes.\n\nHowever, we also ruled out I? But what about position 1 and 3? We need to enumerate.\n\nWe must come up with a guess that includes letters not eliminated to gain information.\n\nWe have:\n  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,I,G} \n  Position 2: similarly\n  Position 3: similarly\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: R\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nFor our next guess, since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we should focus on guessing letters for positions 1,2,3 without repeating eliminated letters.\n\nWe can try to find possible words and choose one that tests many common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? No, we have used 2, so 4 left.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance to hit the correct word or gain information.\n\nProposed strategy: guess a word that includes common letters like S, O, L, B, etc., for the first three positions.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"": \n  P: unknown\n  O: unknown\n  W: unknown\n  E: known at position 4\n  R: known at position 5\n\nBut note: we might get very informative feedback.\n\nAnother option: ""LOVER"": L O V E R\n\nBut perhaps we can choose one that might have been tested? However, nothing has been tested for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe know certain letters are missing: C,A,N,T,I,G.\n\nTherefore, we want to start with letters that are common, such as B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, W, Y.\n\nWe might choose a word that tests multiple vowels? But we don\'t have any vowel constraints except A and I are out.\n\nSo let\'s think: maybe ""SOUER""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""SHOER"": S, H, O, E, R -> SHOER is a shoemaker, valid.\n\nBut let me list possible words:\n\nWords ending with ""ER"" and having E at position 4: \n  - FOUR-LETTER words? For five-letter words:\n\nWe can think of:\n  - with O: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, ROVER, MOWER, ROWER, SOWER, VOWER, etc.\n  - with U: USER? No: U S E R -> position 4 would be E? USER is U,S,E,R -> but that is 4 letters? U-S-E-R: positions: 1:U,2:S,3:E? But we need position 4 to be E? Here position 3 is E, not 4.\n  How about JOKER: J,O,K,E,R -> positions:1:J,2:O,3:K,4:E,5:R -> fits.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIPER"": but P,I,P,E,R -> but I is ruled out (so invalid).\n\n""OFFER"": O,F,F,E,R -> double F? Possible.\n\nBut note: the word OFFER has position 1: O, position 2: F, position 3: F, position 4: E, position 5: R.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested F.\n\nTo get more information, we could choose a word that uses distinct letters and common ones.\n\nFor example, ""POWER"" uses P, O, W — three new distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""LOVER"" uses L, O, V.\n\nOr ""BASER"": but A and S? A is ruled out? We know A isn\'t in the word? From ""crane"", A was marked \'x\', so not present. So ""BASER"" has A — invalid.\n\n""BOZER""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""BOXER"" has X — uncommon.\n\nHow about ""SOBER"": S,O,B,E,R -> positions:1:S,2:O,3:B,4:E,5:R -> fits.\n\nAnd S,O,B are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""HOMER"": H,O,M,E,R -> positions fine.\n\n""LOSER"": L,O,S,E,R -> fine.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSince we have to guess, let\'s choose ""POWER"" as it is a common word.\n\nBut note: we want information. Since we have two positions fixed, we can maximize information about the remaining three.\n\nPerhaps we can guess a word that uses a set of common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nSpecifically, we want to test possible letters for positions 1,2,3.\n\nWe have used so far in guesses: from crane: C,R,A,N,E; from tiger: T,I,G,E,R (but E and R repeated). So unique guessed letters: C,R,A,N,E,T,I,G.\n\nEliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G.\n\nCommon letters not used: S, O, L, B, M, P, H, U, etc.\n\nWe might try a word that includes S, O, and one more.\n\nFor example, ""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R\n\nBut we could also consider that from feedback, we are getting information per position, so if we put S at position 1, O at 2, B at 3, then:\n\n- If S is correct with ✓, well and good, else we get other feedback.\n\nBut note: we must not rush to a word that has many possibilities? We are guessing to find the secret.\n\nThere might be many possibilities: POWER, LOWER, HOVER, BOXER, SOBER, HOMER, etc.\n\nBut we can also think that in the secret word, the first three letters form a stem that with E R makes sense.\n\nLet us choose ""HOVER"" for the next guess. Why? Because H and V are not very common, but we want to test them? Actually, common letter O is included.\n\nPerhaps we choose a word that has O since it\'s a common vowel.\n\nAnother issue: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked \'-\', meaning the secret has R but at a different position — now we know it\'s at 5. Similarly, E was at 5 marked \'-\' meaning it is at a different position — now at 4.\n\nSo no requirement that R or E exist elsewhere? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that there are multiple. The \'-\' means one occurrence elsewhere? But it might be the R at 5 we found.\n\nSo we assume only one R and one E? Because we found them: R at 5, E at 4.\n\nIf there were multiple, we might see feedback indicating more? Not necessarily. So we shall guess assuming that E and R occur only once for now.\n\nFor example, let\'s assume the secret word has exactly one E and one R.\n\nThen, for POWER: P, O, W : no conflict.\n\nSimilarly, LOVER: L, O, V; etc.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""POWER"" because we can test P, O, W.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""POWER"".\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- We know positions 4 and 5 are E and R.\n- The secret word must have: letter1 = ?, letter2 = ?, letter3 = ?, letter4=E, letter5=R.\n- We need a word using letters not ruled out (C,A,N,T,I,G) for the first three positions.\n\n""POWER"" uses P (not used), O (not used), W (not used), and E and R known.\n\nSo it\'s a valid guess.\n\n<guess>power</guess>Based on the previous feedback, we have the following information:\n\n1. **Known Correct Positions**:  \n   - E is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""tiger"").  \n   - R is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from ""tiger"").  \n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, A, N (from ""crane"") and T, I, G (from ""tiger"") are not in the word.  \n\n3. **Previous Guesses**:  \n   - ""crane"": R is in the word but not position 2 (-), E is in the word but not position 5 (-). This is consistent since we now have E at position 4 and R at position 5.  \n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ E R`, where the first three letters must be:\n- Letters **not** in {C, A, N, T, I, G}.  \n- Possible common letters include B, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  \n\nFor this guess, **""POWER""** is chosen because:\n- It tests three new common letters (P, O, W) for positions 1, 2, and 3.  \n- It avoids repeating eliminated letters and leverages the known E in position 4 and R in position 5.  \n- If the guess is incorrect, the feedback for P, O, and W will help narrow down the possibilities for the first three positions.  \n\nThis approach maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.\n\n<guess>power</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: power -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n   - C, A, N are not in the word.\n   - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. **tiger**: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n   - T, I, G are not in the word.\n   - E is correct at position 4.\n   - R is correct at position 5.\n\n3. **power**: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n   - P is in the word but not in position 1 (since it\'s marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position).\n   - O and W are not in the word.\n   - E is correct at position 4 (already known).\n   - R is correct at position 5 (already known).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n- **Confirmed positions**:\n  - Position 4: E\n  - Position 5: R\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W\n  - Total absent: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W\n\n- **Present letters (but position unknown)**:\n  - R and E were already placed (positions 5 and 4 respectively).\n  - P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""power"" feedback).\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we knew R and E were present, which are now placed.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- P in it, but not at position 1.\n- And the known positions: 4=E, 5=R.\n\nThe word pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1 cannot be P (because in ""power"", P at position 1 got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not at position 1). So P must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W.\n\nSo the available letters for positions 1,2,3 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding these.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and P is in the word, so must be used in position 2 or 3).\n\nBut note: we must include P in the word at position 2 or 3.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits: [letter1][letter2][letter3] E R\n\nWith:\n- letter1: not P, and not in {C,A,N,T,I,G,O,W}\n- letter2: could be P or another letter, but P must be in the word at position 2 or 3.\n- letter3: similarly.\n\nAlso, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe know P is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3.\n\nCase 1: P at position 2: then the word is _ P _ E R\n\nCase 2: P at position 3: then the word is _ _ P E R\n\nWe can think of common words:\n\nFor case 2: _ _ P E R\n  Examples: UPPER (but U and P, but U is allowed? But we have two P\'s? The word UPPER has two P\'s? U, P, P, E, R -> so positions: 1:U, 2:P, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R. But we have P at position 2 and 3? However, in our feedback, we only know that P is present (at least one occurrence) and not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at position 2 and 3. But we don\'t know if there are multiple P\'s.\n\nBut note: in the guess ""power"", we had only one P (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means the secret word has at least one P. If the secret has two P\'s, that\'s fine, but we only get one mark for the P we guessed? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence? In Wordle, if the secret has two of a letter and you guess one, you get one mark. If you guess two and the secret has two, both get marked appropriately.\n\nBut in our case, we only guessed one P, so we know there is at least one P, but there could be more.\n\nSimilarly, for UPPER: it has P at positions 2 and 3.\n\nBut we also have to check the absent letters: O and W are absent, and U is not absent? We haven\'t tested U.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, for pattern _ _ P E R:\n  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but we have two P\'s? And U is a vowel.\n  - SUPPER: S,U,P,P,E,R -> 6 letters? No, SUPPER is 6? S-U-P-P-E-R -> 6 letters. Not 5.\n  - PAPER: P,A,P,E,R -> but A is absent (from first guess), so invalid.\n  - CAPER: C,A,P,E,R -> C and A absent, invalid.\n  - TAPER: T,A,P,E,R -> T and A absent.\n  - VIPER: V,I,P,E,R -> I absent.\n  - RIPER: not common, and R is already at position 5? But R is at 5, so position 1 cannot be R? We don\'t know, but in this pattern, position 1 is not P, so it could be R? But we have R at position 5, and if there is another R? But we don\'t know.\n\nActually, we don\'t have information about multiple R\'s. In the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position, and in the second guess, R at position 5 is correct. So if the secret has only one R, then that R is at position 5. If it has two, then there might be another R.\n\nBut in the pattern _ _ P E R, if we put R at position 1, then the word is R _ P E R, which would have two R\'s? For example, ""RIPER"" is not a word. ""RAPER"" has A, invalid. ""ROPER"" has O, which is absent (from power: O is x). ""RUPER"" not a word.\n\nSo perhaps no common words with R at position 1 and P at position 3.\n\nOther words for _ _ P E R:\n  - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> positions: 1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> fits. And S and U are not eliminated.\n  - DUPER: D,U,P,E,R -> also possible, but less common.\n  - JUPER: not a word.\n  - LOPER: L,O,P,E,R -> but O is absent (from power: O is x).\n  - MOPER: M,O,P,E,R -> O absent.\n  - HOPER: H,O,P,E,R -> O absent.\n\nSo ""SUPER"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, case 1: P at position 2: pattern _ P _ E R\n  Examples:\n    - UPPER: but that has P at position 2 and 3? So it fits both patterns? Actually, in UPPER, P is at 2 and 3, so it would be _ P _ E R with the third letter being P? But the pattern is _ P _ E R, meaning position 2 is P, position 3 is something else? In UPPER, position 3 is P, so it\'s the same as the second pattern? Let me write:\n        U P P E R -> position 2 is P, position 3 is P. So for pattern _ P _ E R, the third position is P? But then it\'s not a different letter.\n\n  But we can have words where position 2 is P and position 3 is not P.\n\n  For example:\n    - APTER: A,P,T,E,R -> A and T absent.\n    - OPTER: O,P,T,E,R -> O and T absent.\n    - SPHER: not a word.\n    - SPIER: S,P,I,E,R -> I absent.\n    - SPEER: S,P,E,E,R -> but E at position 3? Then we have E at position 3 and 4? But position 4 is E, so if position 3 is E, that would be a repeated E? And in the feedback, we have E at position 4 correct, but we don\'t know about other E\'s.\n\n  However, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If there is another E at position 3, that would be possible? But let\'s see the feedback for E in the first guess: we had one E guessed and it was marked as present but not at position 5. If the secret has two E\'s, that\'s fine, but we only got one mark for E in the first guess? Actually, the feedback would only mark one E as present (the first occurrence that isn\'t matched?).\n\n  But to avoid complexity, let\'s list:\n\n  For _ P _ E R:\n    - SUPER is not, because SUPER has P at position 3.\n    - PAPER: invalid.\n    - Perhaps ""SPEER""? But SPEER is a proper name? Not common.\n    - ""UPPER"" has P at 2 and 3, so it fits _ P _ E R? Yes, but the third letter is P, so it\'s _ P P E R.\n\n  But we also have ""UPPER"" as a candidate for the other pattern.\n\n  Another: ""OPERA"" is 5 letters? O-P-E-R-A -> but that ends with A, not E R? We need to end with E R.\n\n  How about ""SPERM"": S,P,E,R,M -> but that ends with M, not R? Positions: 1:S,2:P,3:E,4:R,5:M -> but we need position 4 to be E and 5 to be R? So not.\n\n  ""SPERT"" not a word.\n\n  So perhaps the only common word for _ P _ E R is ""UPPER"", but that has P at position 3 as well.\n\n  Alternatively, ""APRES"" is a word? A-P-R-E-S -> but ends with S, not R? And A is absent.\n\n  So let\'s focus on the pattern with P at position 3: _ _ P E R\n\n  We have ""SUPER"" as a candidate.\n\n  Also, ""DUPER"" (if accepted), ""HYPER"" (H,Y,P,E,R) -> H and Y not eliminated.\n\n  ""HYPER"" is a common word.\n\n  ""JAPER"" has A, invalid.\n\n  ""VAPER"" has A, invalid.\n\n  ""PIPER"" has I, invalid.\n\n  ""MOPED"" doesn\'t end with ER.\n\n  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER (which has two P\'s).\n\n  Now, from the feedback of ""power"", we have P marked as present but not at position 1. In ""SUPER"", P is at position 3. In ""HYPER"", P is at position 3. In ""UPPER"", P is at positions 2 and 3.\n\n  Also, we have to consider that in the secret word, the letter at position 1 must not be one of the absent letters.\n\n  For SUPER: position 1 is S, which is not eliminated.\n  For HYPER: position 1 is H, not eliminated.\n  For UPPER: position 1 is U, not eliminated.\n\n  But we have more information: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 marked as present but wrong position. Now we know R is at position 5. So if the secret word has only one R, then there is no R at position 2. But if it has two R\'s, then position 2 could be R? But in our candidates, none of them have R at position 2? \n    - SUPER: S,U,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.\n    - HYPER: H,Y,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.\n    - UPPER: U,P,P,E,R -> no R at position 2.\n\n  So that\'s consistent.\n\n  Now, we need to make a guess that can distinguish between these or get the word.\n\n  We also have to consider other possibilities? For example, P might be at position 2? But we couldn\'t find a common word for _ P _ E R without the third letter being P? So maybe UPPER is the only one? But UPPER has P at both 2 and 3.\n\n  Another possibility: the word might have P at position 2 and a different letter at 3? For example, ""SPEAR"": S,P,E,A,R -> but A is absent? And also, position 3 is E? But we have position 4 as E, so if position 3 is E, then we have two E\'s? And in ""SPEAR"", the E is at position 3 and A at 4? But we need position 4 to be E? So not.\n\n  ""SPEED"" ends with D, not R.\n\n  So perhaps the main candidates are SUPER, HYPER, and UPPER.\n\n  We also have to consider that in the pattern _ _ P E R, the first two letters can be other combinations.\n\n  For example, ""LEPER"": L,E,P,E,R -> but E at position 2? Then we have E at position 2 and 4? And L is not eliminated. But in ""LEPER"", the letters: 1:L, 2:E, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R.\n\n  Now, we know E is at position 4. If there is an E at position 2, that would be a second E? And we have not tested position 2 for E? In the first guess, we had E at position 5 marked as present but not there, so the secret has at least one E. In the second guess, we had E at position 4 correct. If there is a second E at position 2, that\'s possible? But in the feedback for ""tiger"", we had no E at position 2? ""tiger"" had I at position 2, which was absent. So we don\'t know about position 2.\n\n  But in ""LEPER"", we have E at position 2. Now, in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but not there. That E could be the one at position 2? Or the one at position 4? Since we only guessed one E, the feedback marks one occurrence. So if the secret has two E\'s, we still only get one mark for the E we guessed? So it\'s possible.\n\n  Similarly, for ""power"", we had no E at position 1? But we had E at position 4 correct.\n\n  So ""LEPER"" is also a candidate.\n\n  Similarly, ""SEVER"": S,E,V,E,R -> but E at position 2 and 4? And V not eliminated. But ""SEVER"" ends with E,R? S,E,V,E,R -> positions: 1:S,2:E,3:V,4:E,5:R -> so position 4 is E, position 5 is R? Yes.\n\n  But we have E at position 2? So two E\'s.\n\n  And ""BEVER""? Not common.\n\n  So candidates: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER, LEPER, SEVER, etc.\n\n  But we need to use the fact that in ""power"", P is present but not at position 1. In LEPER and SEVER, there is no P? So they don\'t have P? But we know P is in the word! From ""power"", P is present.\n\n  Therefore, LEPER and SEVER do not have P, so they are invalid.\n\n  So only candidates with P: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.\n\n  And we must have P in the word.\n\n  So the secret word must be one of: SUPER, HYPER, UPPER.\n\n  Now, we need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish.\n\n  We have 3 possibilities. We can guess one of them.\n\n  But note: we have to make a guess that is a valid word and uses only available letters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first three positions with new letters to narrow down.\n\n  But since we have only three candidates, we can guess one.\n\n  Let\'s see the letters:\n\n  - SUPER: S, U, P, E, R\n  - HYPER: H, Y, P, E, R\n  - UPPER: U, P, P, E, R\n\n  We can try to guess a word that includes S, U, H, Y, or double P to distinguish.\n\n  But we also have to avoid eliminated letters.\n\n  We can guess ""SUPER"" directly.\n\n  Or, to get more information, we might guess a word that has, say, S and H? But we don\'t know.\n\n  Since we have limited guesses, and we are at the fourth guess, we can try ""SUPER"".\n\n  But if we guess ""SUPER"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback that might help.\n\n  Similarly, we can guess ""HUMPH"" or something, but that doesn\'t fit the pattern? We have to have E at 4 and R at 5.\n\n  We must guess a word that has E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed.\n\n  So our guess must be of the form _ _ _ E R.\n\n  And we want to test the first three letters.\n\n  We can guess ""SUPER"": which is one of the candidates.\n\n  Or we can guess ""HYPER"".\n\n  Or we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests other letters? But we don\'t have many letters left.\n\n  For example, we can guess ""SAMER"" but A is absent? Not.\n\n  ""SIZER"" has I and Z? I absent.\n\n  ""SYRUP"": S,Y,R,U,P -> but doesn\'t end with E R? We need position 4 to be E, but in SYRUP: S,Y,R,U,P -> position 4 is U, not E.\n\n  So we cannot guess a word that doesn\'t have E at 4 and R at 5? Because we know they are fixed, so we must use them to get information about the first three.\n\n  Therefore, we should guess one of the candidates.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""SUPER"" as it is a common word.\n\n  But note: in ""SUPER"", we have S at position 1, U at 2, P at 3.\n\n  If the secret is ""HYPER"", then in ""SUPER"":\n    - S at position 1: would be absent? Because HYPER has H at 1, not S.\n    - U at position 2: absent? HYPER has Y at 2.\n    - P at position 3: present and correct? Both SUPER and HYPER have P at 3? So it would be ✓ for P? And E and R ✓.\n\n  So feedback would be: S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)\n\n  Then we know it\'s not SUPER, and we have two candidates left: HYPER and UPPER.\n\n  Then we can guess HYPER next.\n\n  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""UPPER"", then:\n    - S at 1: absent? UPPER has U at 1? So S is not in the word? But UPPER has no S, so S would be x.\n    - U at 2: in UPPER, position 2 is P, not U? So U would be absent? Or present? U is in UPPER at position 1? But we are guessing U at position 2. So U is in the word but not at position 2? Then U would be marked as \'-\'.\n\n  Let\'s simulate:\n\n  Secret: UPPER (U,P,P,E,R)\n  Guess: SUPER (S,U,P,E,R)\n\n  Feedback:\n    - Position 1: S vs U -> S is not in the word? UPPER has no S -> x\n    - Position 2: U vs P -> U is in the word? U is at position 1 in secret, so U is present but not at position 2 -> \'-\'\n    - Position 3: P vs P -> ✓\n    - Position 4: E vs E -> ✓\n    - Position 5: R vs R -> ✓\n\n  So feedback: S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓)\n\n  Then we know U is in the word but not at position 2. And since we know the word has E at 4 and R at 5, and P at 3, then the word must be UPPER? Because the only candidate with P at 3 and U present is UPPER? And U must be at position 1? Because we have position 1 open.\n\n  Similarly, if we guess ""SUPER"" and the secret is ""HYPER"", we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) meaning the first two are wrong and P is at 3, so then the word must be HYPER? But what about UPPER? In this case, we got U as absent? So UPPER would have U, so if we got U absent, then UPPER is eliminated? \n\n  In the feedback for ""SUPER"" when secret is ""HYPER"":\n    - S: not in HYPER -> x\n    - U: not in HYPER -> x\n    - P: in position 3 -> ✓\n    - E: ✓\n    - R: ✓\n\n  So U is marked x, meaning not in the word. Therefore, UPPER has U, so it would be eliminated? Because if U is not in the word, then UPPER cannot be the word.\n\n  So by guessing ""SUPER"", we can distinguish:\n\n  - If we get S(x), U(x), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is HYPER (since UPPER has U and would not be possible).\n  - If we get S(x), U(-), P(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> then the word is UPPER (because U is present but not at position 2, and HYPER would have given U as absent).\n  - If we get all ✓ except maybe the first two, but if it\'s SUPER, we get all ✓.\n\n  So it\'s a good guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we could guess ""HYPER"" or ""UPPER"" directly.\n\n  But to save a guess, we can guess ""SUPER"".\n\n  However, we have three candidates, and we are at guess 4.\n\n  Let\'s guess ""SUPER"".\n\n  If it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us which of the other two it is.\n\n  So I think ""SUPER"" is a good guess.\n\n  Therefore, the next guess is ""SUPER"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, A, N are absent; R and E are present but in wrong positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).\n- **Guess 2 (tiger)**: T, I, G are absent; E is correct at position 4; R is correct at position 5.\n- **Guess 3 (power)**: O and W are absent; P is present but not in position 1; E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Fixed Positions**: \n  - Position 4 = E (from ""tiger"" ✓).\n  - Position 5 = R (from ""tiger"" ✓).\n- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W (cannot be in the word).\n- **Present Letters**:\n  - P is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""power"" -).\n- **Word Pattern**: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as E and R).\n- P must be in position 2 or 3 (since it cannot be in position 1 and is not in positions 4–5).\n\n### Analysis for Next Guess:\n- The secret word must include P (in position 2 or 3) and exclude all absent letters.\n- Possible candidates (valid English words fitting `_ _ _ E R` with P in position 2 or 3):\n  - **SUPER**: Positions: S (1), U (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).\n  - **HYPER**: Positions: H (1), Y (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).\n  - **UPPER**: Positions: U (1), P (2), P (3), E (4), R (5).\n- **Strategy**: Guess **SUPER** to test the candidates:\n  - If correct, the game ends.\n  - If incorrect, feedback on S and U will distinguish between HYPER and UPPER:\n    - If S and U are absent (x), the word is **HYPER** (since UPPER requires U).\n    - If U is present but wrong position (-), the word is **UPPER** (SUPER\'s U at position 2 would be misplaced if UPPER has U at position 1).\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain by leveraging the fixed E and R positions and testing P in position 3 while probing two key candidates (SUPER and UPPER) in one move.\n\n<guess>super</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: power -> FEEDBACK: P(-) O(x) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: super -> FEEDBACK: S(x) U(-) P(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""super"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- U: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
- P: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 5)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has U, but not in position 2.
- P is confirmed at position 3.
- E at position 4 and R at position 5 are confirmed.
- S is not in the word.

We also have the previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W, S (from this guess)
- Present letters: U (now known), P, E, R (with E and R fixed at positions 4 and 5, and P fixed at position 3)

The word pattern is: _ _ P E R

We know:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is not in the absent list and not S (which is absent). Also, since U is present but not at position 2, and we don't know about position 1, position 1 could be U? But we have U marked as present but wrong position, and it was guessed at position 2. So U must be in the word at a position other than 2. The possible positions for U are 1 or 3? But position 3 is P, so U cannot be at position 3. Therefore, U must be at position 1.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word has U (from the feedback of ""super"": U is present but not at position 2).
- The only positions available are 1 and 3? But position 3 is P (fixed), so U must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must have U at position 1.

So the word is: U _ P E R

Now, we need to find the letter at position 2.

The word pattern: U ? P E R

We know the absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W, S.

Also, we have used: U, P, E, R.

The letter at position 2 must be one that is not in the absent list and not used? But it can be a new letter or even a repeated letter? But we don't have any repeated letters so far.

Possible letters for position 2: from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word: U ? P E R

Common words:
- UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but this has P at position 3? And we have P at position 3. But in UPPER, position 2 is P? So it would be U, P, P, E, R.

But we have P at position 3 already. If the word is UPPER, then:
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: P
  Position 3: P
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

But we know from the feedback of ""power"" that P is present but not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at positions 2 and 3. In the ""super"" guess, we had P at position 3 and it was correct. But we also have U at position 1.

Now, in the feedback for ""super"", we had U marked as present but not at position 2. In UPPER, U is at position 1, so that is consistent because we didn't guess U at position 1? We guessed U at position 2 in ""super"", but in UPPER, U is at position 1, so it is present and not at position 2, so '-' is correct.

Moreover, in the ""power"" guess, we had P at position 1 and it was marked as present but not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at positions 2 and 3, so that is also consistent.

Therefore, UPPER is a candidate.

But are there other candidates?

For example:
- UMPER? Not a common word.
- UBER? U,B,E,R -> but that's 4 letters? UBER is 4 letters. We need 5: U ? P E R, so the second letter must be present and then P.
- ULCER? U,L,C,E,R -> but C is absent (from first guess).
- UDDER? U,D,D,E,R -> but that ends with E,R? U,D,D,E,R -> positions: 1:U,2:D,3:D,4:E,5:R -> but we need position 3 to be P? It is D, not P. So not.

Other words: 
- UPPER is the only common word that fits U ? P E R with the second letter being P? Because if the second letter is P, then it's U P P E R.

But what if the second letter is not P? Then we need a word that has U at 1, then a different letter at 2, then P at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

For example:
  - UMPER? Not a word.
  - UTPER? Not a word.
  - UZPER? Not a word.

So it seems that the only common word is UPPER.

Therefore, the secret word must be UPPER.

We can confirm with the feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(-) [R is at position 5, not 2], A(x), N(x), E(-) [E is at position 4, not 5] -> correct.

Second guess: tiger -> T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓) [position 4], R(✓) [position 5] -> correct.

Third guess: power -> P(-) [P is at position 2 or 3, not 1], O(x), W(x), E(✓), R(✓) -> correct.

Fourth guess: super -> S(x) [not in word], U(-) [U is at position 1, not 2], P(✓) [position 3], E(✓), R(✓) -> correct.

So the word is UPPER.

But note: in UPPER, there are two P's. In the feedback for ""power"", we had only one P guessed (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That is consistent because there is at least one P (and we found it at position 3). The feedback doesn't tell us about the second P because we only guessed one P.

Similarly, in ""super"", we guessed P at position 3 and it was correct, which matches.

Therefore, we can guess UPPER for the fifth guess.

But we are to make a new guess, so we guess UPPER.

However, we are at the fifth guess? We have made four guesses, so this is the fifth.

So the guess is UPPER.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced as **UPPER**. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 3: **P** (✓ from ""super"").
   - Position 4: **E** (✓ from ""tiger"" and ""power"").
   - Position 5: **R** (✓ from ""tiger"" and ""power"").

2. **Present Letters**:
   - **U** is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""super"" → U(-)).
   - Since position 3 is fixed as P, and positions 4–5 are E and R, **U must be at position 1** (the only remaining position).

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"").
   - T, I, G (from ""tiger"").
   - O, W (from ""power"").
   - S (from ""super"").

4. **Word Pattern**:
   - The word must be `U _ P E R` (with position 1 = U, position 3 = P, position 4 = E, position 5 = R).
   - Position 2 must be a letter not in the absent list and valid in English. The only common word fitting this pattern is **UPPER** (where position 2 = P).

### Why UPPER?
- **UPPER** (U, P, P, E, R) satisfies all feedback:
  - **crane**: R(-) and E(-) confirm R and E are present (positions 5 and 4), while C, A, N are absent.
  - **tiger**: E(✓) at position 4, R(✓) at position 5; T, I, G absent.
  - **power**: P(-) confirms P is present (now at positions 2 and 3), O and W absent.
  - **super**: U(-) confirms U is present (at position 1), S absent; P(✓) at position 3.
- No other valid 5-letter word (e.g., UMPER, UDDER) fits the pattern and constraints.

<guess>upper</guess>",upper,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""super"":
- S: x (not in the word)
- U: - (in the word but wrong position; was in position 2)
- P: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 3)
- E: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 4)
- R: ✓ (correct letter and position; position 5)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has U, but not in position 2.
- P is confirmed at position 3.
- E at position 4 and R at position 5 are confirmed.
- S is not in the word.

We also have the previous feedback:
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W, S (from this guess)
- Present letters: U (now known), P, E, R (with E and R fixed at positions 4 and 5, and P fixed at position 3)

The word pattern is: _ _ P E R

We know:
- Position 1: must be a letter that is not in the absent list and not S (which is absent). Also, since U is present but not at position 2, and we don't know about position 1, position 1 could be U? But we have U marked as present but wrong position, and it was guessed at position 2. So U must be in the word at a position other than 2. The possible positions for U are 1 or 3? But position 3 is P, so U cannot be at position 3. Therefore, U must be at position 1.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word has U (from the feedback of ""super"": U is present but not at position 2).
- The only positions available are 1 and 3? But position 3 is P (fixed), so U must be at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word must have U at position 1.

So the word is: U _ P E R

Now, we need to find the letter at position 2.

The word pattern: U ? P E R

We know the absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, O, W, S.

Also, we have used: U, P, E, R.

The letter at position 2 must be one that is not in the absent list and not used? But it can be a new letter or even a repeated letter? But we don't have any repeated letters so far.

Possible letters for position 2: from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word: U ? P E R

Common words:
- UPPER: U, P, P, E, R -> but this has P at position 3? And we have P at position 3. But in UPPER, position 2 is P? So it would be U, P, P, E, R.

But we have P at position 3 already. If the word is UPPER, then:
  Position 1: U
  Position 2: P
  Position 3: P
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: R

But we know from the feedback of ""power"" that P is present but not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at positions 2 and 3. In the ""super"" guess, we had P at position 3 and it was correct. But we also have U at position 1.

Now, in the feedback for ""super"", we had U marked as present but not at position 2. In UPPER, U is at position 1, so that is consistent because we didn't guess U at position 1? We guessed U at position 2 in ""super"", but in UPPER, U is at position 1, so it is present and not at position 2, so '-' is correct.

Moreover, in the ""power"" guess, we had P at position 1 and it was marked as present but not at position 1. In UPPER, P is at positions 2 and 3, so that is also consistent.

Therefore, UPPER is a candidate.

But are there other candidates?

For example:
- UMPER? Not a common word.
- UBER? U,B,E,R -> but that's 4 letters? UBER is 4 letters. We need 5: U ? P E R, so the second letter must be present and then P.
- ULCER? U,L,C,E,R -> but C is absent (from first guess).
- UDDER? U,D,D,E,R -> but that ends with E,R? U,D,D,E,R -> positions: 1:U,2:D,3:D,4:E,5:R -> but we need position 3 to be P? It is D, not P. So not.

Other words: 
- UPPER is the only common word that fits U ? P E R with the second letter being P? Because if the second letter is P, then it's U P P E R.

But what if the second letter is not P? Then we need a word that has U at 1, then a different letter at 2, then P at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

For example:
  - UMPER? Not a word.
  - UTPER? Not a word.
  - UZPER? Not a word.

So it seems that the only common word is UPPER.

Therefore, the secret word must be UPPER.

We can confirm with the feedback:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(-) [R is at position 5, not 2], A(x), N(x), E(-) [E is at position 4, not 5] -> correct.

Second guess: tiger -> T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓) [position 4], R(✓) [position 5] -> correct.

Third guess: power -> P(-) [P is at position 2 or 3, not 1], O(x), W(x), E(✓), R(✓) -> correct.

Fourth guess: super -> S(x) [not in word], U(-) [U is at position 1, not 2], P(✓) [position 3], E(✓), R(✓) -> correct.

So the word is UPPER.

But note: in UPPER, there are two P's. In the feedback for ""power"", we had only one P guessed (at position 1) and it was marked as present but wrong position. That is consistent because there is at least one P (and we found it at position 3). The feedback doesn't tell us about the second P because we only guessed one P.

Similarly, in ""super"", we guessed P at position 3 and it was correct, which matches.

Therefore, we can guess UPPER for the fifth guess.

But we are to make a new guess, so we guess UPPER.

However, we are at the fifth guess? We have made four guesses, so this is the fifth.

So the guess is UPPER.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, the secret word has been deduced as **UPPER**. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 3: **P** (✓ from ""super"").
   - Position 4: **E** (✓ from ""tiger"" and ""power"").
   - Position 5: **R** (✓ from ""tiger"" and ""power"").

2. **Present Letters**:
   - **U** is in the word but not at position 2 (from ""super"" → U(-)).
   - Since position 3 is fixed as P, and positions 4–5 are E and R, **U must be at position 1** (the only remaining position).

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - C, A, N (from ""crane"").
   - T, I, G (from ""tiger"").
   - O, W (from ""power"").
   - S (from ""super"").

4. **Word Pattern**:
   - The word must be `U _ P E R` (with position 1 = U, position 3 = P, position 4 = E, position 5 = R).
   - Position 2 must be a letter not in the absent list and valid in English. The only common word fitting this pattern is **UPPER** (where position 2 = P).

### Why UPPER?
- **UPPER** (U, P, P, E, R) satisfies all feedback:
  - **crane**: R(-) and E(-) confirm R and E are present (positions 5 and 4), while C, A, N are absent.
  - **tiger**: E(✓) at position 4, R(✓) at position 5; T, I, G absent.
  - **power**: P(-) confirms P is present (now at positions 2 and 3), O and W absent.
  - **super**: U(-) confirms U is present (at position 1), S absent; P(✓) at position 3.
- No other valid 5-letter word (e.g., UMPER, UDDER) fits the pattern and constraints.",Guess 5: upper -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) P(✓) P(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
