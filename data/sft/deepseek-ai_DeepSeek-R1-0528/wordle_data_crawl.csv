We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C, R, and A are in the secret word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: C R A _ _

 We know the first three letters are C, R, A in that order.

 The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not N or E.

 Also, since N and E are not in the word, we must avoid any word that contains N or E.

 We have to guess a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and the last two letters are not N or E, and also the entire word must not contain N or E.

 Let's think of words that start with ""CRA"":

 Common words: 
   crab, crag, cram, crap, craw, cray, craal, craic (but craic is 5 letters? Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the first three are correct, so the word is C R A ? ?

 We must avoid N and E.

 Let's list possible words:

 - crab: ends with B -> C R A B (but that's 4 letters? Wait, crab is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"":

 - craal: not common, but it's a word? (a type of enclosure) -> C R A A L -> but has two A's? The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A's? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don't have any information about that.

 - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That's acceptable.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C's? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?

 Important: The feedback rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn't guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn't get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn't guess, so we don't know about it.

 But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.

 Let's look for other words:

 - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.

 - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.

 - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.

 - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.

 - crass: C R A S S -> has two S's? But we don't know about S.

 - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.

 - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.

 - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.

 - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.

 - craze: has E? Forbidden.

 - craal: C R A A L -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's? But it's acceptable.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn't contain N or E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

 1. cramp
 2. crash
 3. crass
 4. craws
 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don't know about S)
 6. craal (if accepted)

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We can also think of: 
   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.

 So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.

 However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

 We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.

 But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.

 We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.

 For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.

 But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven't tried yet, especially common consonants.

 We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).

 We also know that the first three are C, R, A.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.

 Let's choose ""crash"": 
   C R A S H

 If we get feedback:
   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.
   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it's in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.

   Similarly for H.

 However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S's. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an 'x' for H and also we would get a '-' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates?

 Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn't guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S's, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S's) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn't guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an 'x' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don't get any indication for that second S? That's a problem.

 Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: 
   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.
   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.

 But note: the secret word has two S's? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S's in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn't guess an S in the 5th, so we don't get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":
   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":
      C: ✓ (correct position)
      R: ✓ (correct position)
      A: ✓ (correct position)
      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.
      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.

   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)

   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)

   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.

 So in both cases, we get one x at the end.

 But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.

 Let's try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.

 So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.

 Possibilities: 
   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.
   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.
   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.
   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.

 However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.

 Let's choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven't tried them.

 So I will guess ""craft"".

 If the feedback for ""craft"" is:
   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)

 We hope to get information about the last two.

 But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.

 Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.

 However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that's not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.

 But let's see: if we get:
   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.
   T is x: then T is not in the word.

   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.

 Actually, the feedback is independent per position.

 Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)

   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.

 Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.

   Same as above.

 But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x's and we know the last two are not F or T.

 We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.

 So it's a good strategy.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.

 I think ""craft"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""craft"".

<guess>craft</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:
- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""
- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5
- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity

<guess>craft</guess>",craft,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C, R, and A are in the secret word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: C R A _ _

 We know the first three letters are C, R, A in that order.

 The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not N or E.

 Also, since N and E are not in the word, we must avoid any word that contains N or E.

 We have to guess a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and the last two letters are not N or E, and also the entire word must not contain N or E.

 Let's think of words that start with ""CRA"":

 Common words: 
   crab, crag, cram, crap, craw, cray, craal, craic (but craic is 5 letters? Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)

So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn't guess, so we don't know about it.

 But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.

 Let's look for other words:

 - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.

 - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.

 - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.

 - crass: C R A S S -> has two S's? But we don't know about S.

 - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.

But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an 'x' for H and also we would get a '-' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates?

 Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn't guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S's, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S's) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn't guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an 'x' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don't get any indication for that second S? That's a problem.

 Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: 
   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.
   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.

 But note: the secret word has two S's? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S's in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn't guess an S in the 5th, so we don't get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":
   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":
      C: ✓ (correct position)
      R: ✓ (correct position)
      A: ✓ (correct position)
      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.
      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.

   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)

   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)

   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.

 So in both cases, we get one x at the end.

 But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.

 Let's try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.

 So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.

 Possibilities: 
   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.
   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.
   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.
   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.

 However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.

 Let's choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven't tried them.

 So I will guess ""craft"".

 If the feedback for ""craft"" is:
   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)

 We hope to get information about the last two.

 But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.

 Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.

 However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that's not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.

 But let's see: if we get:
   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.
   T is x: then T is not in the word.

   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.

 Actually, the feedback is independent per position.

 Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)

   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.

 Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.

   Same as above.

 But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x's and we know the last two are not F or T.

 We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.

 So it's a good strategy.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.

 I think ""craft"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""craft"".

<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:
- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""
- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5
- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity",Guess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C, R, and A are in the secret word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: C R A _ _

 We know the first three letters are C, R, A in that order.

 The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not N or E.

 Also, since N and E are not in the word, we must avoid any word that contains N or E.

 We have to guess a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and the last two letters are not N or E, and also the entire word must not contain N or E.

 Let's think of words that start with ""CRA"":

 Common words: 
   crab, crag, cram, crap, craw, cray, craal, craic (but craic is 5 letters? Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the first three are correct, so the word is C R A ? ?

 We must avoid N and E.

 Let's list possible words:

 - crab: ends with B -> C R A B (but that's 4 letters? Wait, crab is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"":

 - craal: not common, but it's a word? (a type of enclosure) -> C R A A L -> but has two A's? The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A's? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don't have any information about that.

 - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That's acceptable.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C's? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?

 Important: The feedback rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn't guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn't get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn't guess, so we don't know about it.

 But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.

 Let's look for other words:

 - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.

 - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.

 - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.

 - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.

 - crass: C R A S S -> has two S's? But we don't know about S.

 - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.

 - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.

 - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.

 - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.

 - craze: has E? Forbidden.

 - craal: C R A A L -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's? But it's acceptable.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn't contain N or E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

 1. cramp
 2. crash
 3. crass
 4. craws
 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don't know about S)
 6. craal (if accepted)

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We can also think of: 
   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.

 So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.

 However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

 We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.

 But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.

 We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.

 For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.

 But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven't tried yet, especially common consonants.

 We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).

 We also know that the first three are C, R, A.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.

 Let's choose ""crash"": 
   C R A S H

 If we get feedback:
   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.
   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it's in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.

   Similarly for H.

 However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S's. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an 'x' for H and also we would get a '-' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates?

 Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn't guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S's, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S's) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn't guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an 'x' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don't get any indication for that second S? That's a problem.

 Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: 
   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.
   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.

 But note: the secret word has two S's? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S's in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn't guess an S in the 5th, so we don't get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":
   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":
      C: ✓ (correct position)
      R: ✓ (correct position)
      A: ✓ (correct position)
      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.
      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.

   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)

   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)

   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.

 So in both cases, we get one x at the end.

 But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.

 Let's try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.

 So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.

 Possibilities: 
   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.
   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.
   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.
   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.

 However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.

 Let's choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven't tried them.

 So I will guess ""craft"".

 If the feedback for ""craft"" is:
   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)

 We hope to get information about the last two.

 But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.

 Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.

 However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that's not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.

 But let's see: if we get:
   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.
   T is x: then T is not in the word.

   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.

 Actually, the feedback is independent per position.

 Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)

   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.

 Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.

   Same as above.

 But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x's and we know the last two are not F or T.

 We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.

 So it's a good strategy.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.

 I think ""craft"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""craft"".

<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:

The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A\'s? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don\'t have any information about that.\n\n - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C\'s? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?\n\n Important: The feedback rules don\'t specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn\'t guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn\'t get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.\n\n However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn\'t guess, so we don\'t know about it.\n\n But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.\n\n Let\'s look for other words:\n\n - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.\n\n - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.\n\n - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.\n\n - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.\n\n - crass: C R A S S -> has two S\'s? But we don\'t know about S.\n\n - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.\n\n - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.\n\n - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.\n\n - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.\n\n - craze: has E? Forbidden.\n\n - craal: C R A A L -> has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? But it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn\'t contain N or E.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities:\n\n 1. cramp\n 2. crash\n 3. crass\n 4. craws\n 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don\'t know about S)\n 6. craal (if accepted)\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n We can also think of: \n   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.\n\n So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.\n\n However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\n We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.\n\n But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.\n\n We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.\n\n For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.\n\n But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\n Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven\'t tried yet, especially common consonants.\n\n We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).\n\n We also know that the first three are C, R, A.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.\n\n Let\'s choose ""crash"": \n   C R A S H\n\n If we get feedback:\n   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.\n   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it\'s in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.\n\n   Similarly for H.\n\n However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S\'s. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an \'x\' for H and also we would get a \'-\' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S\'s? How does the feedback handle duplicates?\n\n Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn\'t guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S\'s, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S\'s) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn\'t guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an \'x\' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don\'t get any indication for that second S? That\'s a problem.\n\n Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: \n   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.\n   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.\n\n But note: the secret word has two S\'s? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S\'s in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn\'t guess an S in the 5th, so we don\'t get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":\n   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":\n      C: ✓ (correct position)\n      R: ✓ (correct position)\n      A: ✓ (correct position)\n      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.\n      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.\n\n   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)\n\n   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":\n      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)\n\n   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.\n\n So in both cases, we get one x at the end.\n\n But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.\n\n Let\'s try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.\n\n So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.\n   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.\n   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.\n   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.\n\n Let\'s choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven\'t tried them.\n\n So I will guess ""craft"".\n\n If the feedback for ""craft"" is:\n   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)\n\n We hope to get information about the last two.\n\n But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.\n\n Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.\n\n However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that\'s not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.\n\n But let\'s see: if we get:\n   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.\n   T is x: then T is not in the word.\n\n   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.\n\n Actually, the feedback is independent per position.\n\n Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n\n   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.\n\n Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.\n\n   Same as above.\n\n But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x\'s and we know the last two are not F or T.\n\n We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.\n\n So it\'s a good strategy.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.\n\n I think ""craft"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""craft"".\n\n<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:\n- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""\n- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5\n- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity\n\n<guess>craft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _
- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Starts with ""CRA""
- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.
- Must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't ruled that out yet.

But we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess any duplicate letters, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.

Let's list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.

Common words:
- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".
- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.
- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it's a word.
- craws: C R A W S → W and S.
- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it's sometimes accepted. We'll consider common and acceptable words.
- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn't forbidden A from appearing again? So it's possible.

However, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn't guess another A? So it wouldn't show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it's possible.

But let's see which words we haven't tested letters for.

We need to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E
- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T

So we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).

We haven't tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.
- cramp: tests M and P.
- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven't tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.

But wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.

Also, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven't tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?

Other options:

We might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven't tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don't know if it's there.

But we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.

Let me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it's not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.

But since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.

Typically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me pick ""crash"": 
  C R A S H

If the feedback:
  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it's in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it's S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.

But then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that's a word.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.

But we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.

Let me list all possible common words that fit:

- cramp (M, P)
- crash (S, H)
- crass (S, S) → double S
- craws (W, S)
- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven't tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.
- crawl (W, L)
- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.
- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C's? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:
   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)
   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:
      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.
      Position2: R → ✓
      Position3: A → ✓
      Position4: I → ? 
      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C's? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:
         For the fifth C: if the secret's fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn't guess that position? It's messy.

I think ""craic"" is not a common choice.

We need to consider the information we gain.

If we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.

But if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, let's avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can't change them? The word must start with CRA.

So every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.

But the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.

Therefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried.

For example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it's unusual. Common words are better.

Common possibilities: 
   cramp: M and P
   crash: S and H
   crwth: not common? Skip.

Also, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".

""craze"" has E? Forbidden.

So valid ones without forbidden letters:

1. cramp: M and P
2. crash: S and H
3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)
4. craws: W and S
5. crabs: B and S
6. crawl: W and L
7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.
8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That's acceptable? But then we have two C's? And letter K? But we haven't ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?

But ""crack"": 
   C R A C K
   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:
      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn't have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:
        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn't have an additional C? So it would be x? But it's confusing.

To avoid complication, I'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.

But for simplicity, try distinct letters.

So let's choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?

S is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.

Also, ""crash"" is a standard English word.

So I propose ""crash"".

If the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.

If not, the feedback from ""crash"": 
   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.

   Possible feedback:
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it's the secret.
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.
   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven't tested D?

However, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.

But similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it's in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn't contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn't contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.

Then we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.

Similarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:
   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.

Both ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I'll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.

So the next guess: ""crash""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.

The secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". 

I chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:
- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".
- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.
- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).
- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.

<guess>crash</guess>",crash,"We are given the feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _
- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Starts with ""CRA""
- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.
- Must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't ruled that out yet.

But we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess any duplicate letters, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.

Let's list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.

Common words:
- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".
- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.
- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it's a word.
- craws: C R A W S → W and S.
- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it's sometimes accepted. We'll consider common and acceptable words.
- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn't forbidden A from appearing again? So it's possible.

However, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn't guess another A? So it wouldn't show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it's possible.

But let's see which words we haven't tested letters for.

We need to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E
- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T

So we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).

We haven't tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.
- cramp: tests M and P.
- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven't tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.

But wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.

Also, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven't tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?

Other options:

We might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven't tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don't know if it's there.

But we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.

Let me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it's not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.

But since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.

Typically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me pick ""crash"": 
  C R A S H

If the feedback:
  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it's in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it's S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.

But then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that's a word.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.

But we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.

Let me list all possible common words that fit:

- cramp (M, P)
- crash (S, H)
- crass (S, S) → double S
- craws (W, S)
- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven't tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.
- crawl (W, L)
- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.
- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C's? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:
   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)
   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:
      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.
      Position2: R → ✓
      Position3: A → ✓
      Position4: I → ? 
      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C's? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:
         For the fifth C: if the secret's fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn't guess that position? It's messy.

I think ""craic"" is not a common choice.

We need to consider the information we gain.

If we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.

But if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, let's avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can't change them? The word must start with CRA.

So every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.

But the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.

Therefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried.

For example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it's unusual. Common words are better.

Common possibilities: 
   cramp: M and P
   crash: S and H
   crwth: not common? Skip.

Also, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".

""craze"" has E? Forbidden.

So valid ones without forbidden letters:

1. cramp: M and P
2. crash: S and H
3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)
4. craws: W and S
5. crabs: B and S
6. crawl: W and L
7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.
8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That's acceptable? But then we have two C's? And letter K? But we haven't ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?

But ""crack"": 
   C R A C K
   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:
      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn't have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:
        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn't have an additional C? So it would be x? But it's confusing.

To avoid complication, I'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.

But for simplicity, try distinct letters.

So let's choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?

S is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.

Also, ""crash"" is a standard English word.

So I propose ""crash"".

If the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.

If not, the feedback from ""crash"": 
   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.

   Possible feedback:
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it's the secret.
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.
   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven't tested D?

However, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.

But similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it's in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn't contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn't contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.

Then we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.

Similarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:
   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.

Both ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I'll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.

So the next guess: ""crash""After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.

The secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". 

I chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:
- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".
- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.
- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).
- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.",Guess 3: crash -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) H(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C, R, and A are in the secret word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: C R A _ _

 We know the first three letters are C, R, A in that order.

 The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not N or E.

 Also, since N and E are not in the word, we must avoid any word that contains N or E.

 We have to guess a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and the last two letters are not N or E, and also the entire word must not contain N or E.

 Let's think of words that start with ""CRA"":

 Common words: 
   crab, crag, cram, crap, craw, cray, craal, craic (but craic is 5 letters? Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the first three are correct, so the word is C R A ? ?

 We must avoid N and E.

 Let's list possible words:

 - crab: ends with B -> C R A B (but that's 4 letters? Wait, crab is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"":

 - craal: not common, but it's a word? (a type of enclosure) -> C R A A L -> but has two A's? The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A's? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don't have any information about that.

 - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That's acceptable.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C's? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?

 Important: The feedback rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn't guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn't get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn't guess, so we don't know about it.

 But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.

 Let's look for other words:

 - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.

 - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.

 - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.

 - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.

 - crass: C R A S S -> has two S's? But we don't know about S.

 - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.

 - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.

 - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.

 - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.

 - craze: has E? Forbidden.

 - craal: C R A A L -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's? But it's acceptable.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn't contain N or E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

 1. cramp
 2. crash
 3. crass
 4. craws
 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don't know about S)
 6. craal (if accepted)

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We can also think of: 
   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.

 So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.

 However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

 We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.

 But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.

 We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.

 For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.

 But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven't tried yet, especially common consonants.

 We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).

 We also know that the first three are C, R, A.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.

 Let's choose ""crash"": 
   C R A S H

 If we get feedback:
   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.
   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it's in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.

   Similarly for H.

 However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S's. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an 'x' for H and also we would get a '-' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates?

 Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn't guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S's, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S's) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn't guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an 'x' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don't get any indication for that second S? That's a problem.

 Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: 
   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.
   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.

 But note: the secret word has two S's? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S's in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn't guess an S in the 5th, so we don't get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":
   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":
      C: ✓ (correct position)
      R: ✓ (correct position)
      A: ✓ (correct position)
      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.
      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.

   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)

   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)

   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.

 So in both cases, we get one x at the end.

 But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.

 Let's try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.

 So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.

 Possibilities: 
   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.
   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.
   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.
   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.

 However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.

 Let's choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven't tried them.

 So I will guess ""craft"".

 If the feedback for ""craft"" is:
   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)

 We hope to get information about the last two.

 But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.

 Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.

 However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that's not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.

 But let's see: if we get:
   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.
   T is x: then T is not in the word.

   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.

 Actually, the feedback is independent per position.

 Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)

   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.

 Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.

   Same as above.

 But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x's and we know the last two are not F or T.

 We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.

 So it's a good strategy.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.

 I think ""craft"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""craft"".

<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:
- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""
- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5
- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _
- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Starts with ""CRA""
- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.
- Must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't ruled that out yet.

But we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess any duplicate letters, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.

Let's list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.

Common words:
- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".
- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.
- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it's a word.
- craws: C R A W S → W and S.
- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it's sometimes accepted. We'll consider common and acceptable words.
- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn't forbidden A from appearing again? So it's possible.

However, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn't guess another A? So it wouldn't show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it's possible.

But let's see which words we haven't tested letters for.

We need to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E
- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T

So we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).

We haven't tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.
- cramp: tests M and P.
- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven't tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.

But wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.

Also, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven't tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?

Other options:

We might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven't tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don't know if it's there.

But we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.

Let me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it's not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.

But since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.

Typically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me pick ""crash"": 
  C R A S H

If the feedback:
  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it's in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it's S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.

But then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that's a word.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.

But we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.

Let me list all possible common words that fit:

- cramp (M, P)
- crash (S, H)
- crass (S, S) → double S
- craws (W, S)
- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven't tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.
- crawl (W, L)
- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.
- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C's? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:
   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)
   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:
      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.
      Position2: R → ✓
      Position3: A → ✓
      Position4: I → ? 
      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C's? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:
         For the fifth C: if the secret's fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn't guess that position? It's messy.

I think ""craic"" is not a common choice.

We need to consider the information we gain.

If we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.

But if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, let's avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can't change them? The word must start with CRA.

So every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.

But the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.

Therefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried.

For example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it's unusual. Common words are better.

Common possibilities: 
   cramp: M and P
   crash: S and H
   crwth: not common? Skip.

Also, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".

""craze"" has E? Forbidden.

So valid ones without forbidden letters:

1. cramp: M and P
2. crash: S and H
3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)
4. craws: W and S
5. crabs: B and S
6. crawl: W and L
7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.
8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That's acceptable? But then we have two C's? And letter K? But we haven't ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?

But ""crack"": 
   C R A C K
   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:
      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn't have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:
        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn't have an additional C? So it would be x? But it's confusing.

To avoid complication, I'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.

But for simplicity, try distinct letters.

So let's choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?

S is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.

Also, ""crash"" is a standard English word.

So I propose ""crash"".

If the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.

If not, the feedback from ""crash"": 
   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.

   Possible feedback:
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it's the secret.
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.
   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven't tested D?

However, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.

But similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it's in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn't contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn't contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.

Then we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.

Similarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:
   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.

Both ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I'll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.

So the next guess: ""crash""After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.

The secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". 

I chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:
- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".
- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.
- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).
- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.

Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)\n\n However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the first three are correct, so the word is C R A ? ?\n\n We must avoid N and E.\n\n Let\'s list possible words:\n\n - crab: ends with B -> C R A B (but that\'s 4 letters? Wait, crab is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)\n\n 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"":\n\n - craal: not common, but it\'s a word? (a type of enclosure) -> C R A A L -> but has two A\'s? The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A\'s? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don\'t have any information about that.\n\n - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C\'s? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?\n\n Important: The feedback rules don\'t specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn\'t guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn\'t get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.\n\n However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn\'t guess, so we don\'t know about it.\n\n But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.\n\n Let\'s look for other words:\n\n - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.\n\n - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.\n\n - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.\n\n - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.\n\n - crass: C R A S S -> has two S\'s? But we don\'t know about S.\n\n - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.\n\n - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.\n\n - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.\n\n - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.\n\n - craze: has E? Forbidden.\n\n - craal: C R A A L -> has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? But it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn\'t contain N or E.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities:\n\n 1. cramp\n 2. crash\n 3. crass\n 4. craws\n 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don\'t know about S)\n 6. craal (if accepted)\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n We can also think of: \n   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.\n\n So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.\n\n However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\n We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.\n\n But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.\n\n We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.\n\n For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.\n\n But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\n Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven\'t tried yet, especially common consonants.\n\n We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).\n\n We also know that the first three are C, R, A.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.\n\n Let\'s choose ""crash"": \n   C R A S H\n\n If we get feedback:\n   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.\n   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it\'s in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.\n\n   Similarly for H.\n\n However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S\'s. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an \'x\' for H and also we would get a \'-\' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S\'s? How does the feedback handle duplicates?\n\n Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn\'t guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S\'s, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S\'s) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn\'t guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an \'x\' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don\'t get any indication for that second S? That\'s a problem.\n\n Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: \n   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.\n   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.\n\n But note: the secret word has two S\'s? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S\'s in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn\'t guess an S in the 5th, so we don\'t get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":\n   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":\n      C: ✓ (correct position)\n      R: ✓ (correct position)\n      A: ✓ (correct position)\n      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.\n      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.\n\n   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)\n\n   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":\n      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)\n\n   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.\n\n So in both cases, we get one x at the end.\n\n But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.\n\n Let\'s try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.\n\n So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.\n   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.\n   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.\n   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.\n\n Let\'s choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven\'t tried them.\n\n So I will guess ""craft"".\n\n If the feedback for ""craft"" is:\n   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)\n\n We hope to get information about the last two.\n\n But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.\n\n Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.\n\n However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that\'s not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.\n\n But let\'s see: if we get:\n   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.\n   T is x: then T is not in the word.\n\n   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.\n\n Actually, the feedback is independent per position.\n\n Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n\n   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.\n\n Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.\n\n   Same as above.\n\n But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x\'s and we know the last two are not F or T.\n\n We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.\n\n So it\'s a good strategy.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.\n\n I think ""craft"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""craft"".\n\n<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:\n- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""\n- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5\n- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity\n\n<guess>craft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from two guesses:\n1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.\n2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _\n- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits:\n- Starts with ""CRA""\n- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.\n- Must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven\'t ruled that out yet.\n\nBut we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess any duplicate letters, we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.\n\nCommon words:\n- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".\n- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.\n- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it\'s a word.\n- craws: C R A W S → W and S.\n- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it\'s sometimes accepted. We\'ll consider common and acceptable words.\n- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn\'t forbidden A from appearing again? So it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn\'t guess another A? So it wouldn\'t show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see which words we haven\'t tested letters for.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet to get more information.\n\nWe have tested:\n- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E\n- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T\n\nSo we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.\n- cramp: tests M and P.\n- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven\'t tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.\n\nBut wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.\n\nAlso, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven\'t tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?\n\nOther options:\n\nWe might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven\'t tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don\'t know if it\'s there.\n\nBut we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.\n\nLet me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it\'s not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.\n\nBut since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.\n\nTypically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nLet me pick ""crash"": \n  C R A S H\n\nIf the feedback:\n  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it\'s in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it\'s S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.\n\nBut then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that\'s a word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.\n\nBut we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.\n\nLet me list all possible common words that fit:\n\n- cramp (M, P)\n- crash (S, H)\n- crass (S, S) → double S\n- craws (W, S)\n- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven\'t tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.\n- crawl (W, L)\n- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.\n- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C\'s? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:\n   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)\n   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:\n      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.\n      Position2: R → ✓\n      Position3: A → ✓\n      Position4: I → ? \n      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C\'s? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:\n         For the fifth C: if the secret\'s fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn\'t guess that position? It\'s messy.\n\nI think ""craic"" is not a common choice.\n\nWe need to consider the information we gain.\n\nIf we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.\n\nBut if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can\'t change them? The word must start with CRA.\n\nSo every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.\n\nBut the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nFor example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it\'s unusual. Common words are better.\n\nCommon possibilities: \n   cramp: M and P\n   crash: S and H\n   crwth: not common? Skip.\n\nAlso, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".\n\n""craze"" has E? Forbidden.\n\nSo valid ones without forbidden letters:\n\n1. cramp: M and P\n2. crash: S and H\n3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)\n4. craws: W and S\n5. crabs: B and S\n6. crawl: W and L\n7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.\n8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That\'s acceptable? But then we have two C\'s? And letter K? But we haven\'t ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?\n\nBut ""crack"": \n   C R A C K\n   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:\n      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn\'t have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:\n        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn\'t have an additional C? So it would be x? But it\'s confusing.\n\nTo avoid complication, I\'ll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.\n\nBut for simplicity, try distinct letters.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?\n\nS is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.\n\nAlso, ""crash"" is a standard English word.\n\nSo I propose ""crash"".\n\nIf the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.\n\nIf not, the feedback from ""crash"": \n   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.\n\n   Possible feedback:\n   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it\'s the secret.\n   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.\n   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven\'t tested D?\n\nHowever, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.\n\nBut similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it\'s in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn\'t contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn\'t contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.\n\nThen we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:\n   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.\n\nBoth ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I\'ll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.\n\nSo the next guess: ""crash""After analyzing the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.\n- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.\n\nThe secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". \n\nI chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:\n- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".\n- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.\n- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).\n- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.\n\n<guess>crash</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: crash -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - The word starts with ""CRA"", and does not contain N or E.

2. ""craft"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and F and T are not in the word.

3. ""crash"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and S and H are not in the word.

So, the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and the missing two letters are not any of: N, E, F, T, S, H.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that does not contain the forbidden letters: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Let's list possible letters for the last two positions. The available letters are from the alphabet excluding:
- C, R, A (which are already in the word, but note: they might appear again? However, we haven't been told they can't, but we have to consider the feedback: the feedback for the first three are correct, but we don't know about duplicates. However, the feedback for the last two in ""crash"" said S and H are absent, so they are not in the word at all, even as duplicates? The feedback marks a letter as absent (x) if it is not in the word at all. So if the word had an S, but we guessed it in the wrong position, it would be marked with a dash (-). But in ""crash"", the S and H are marked as (x), meaning they are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Also, we know the first three letters are C, R, A, so the word is ""C R A X Y"", where X and Y are letters not in {N, E, F, T, S, H}.

Now, what are the possible words?

Common words that start with ""CRA"" and are 5 letters:

- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed? M and P are not in the forbidden list.
- craw: but ""craw"" is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
- crawl: but that's 5 letters? C R A W L -> but we have W and L? Are they forbidden? No, W and L are not in the forbidden list. But wait, ""crawl"" has 5 letters: C-R-A-W-L? Yes.
- craze: but E is forbidden? Yes, so no.
- craal: C R A A L -> A is already in the word? But we are allowed duplicates? However, the feedback hasn't indicated that A is duplicated? But it's possible. And A is not forbidden? But we have to check: the forbidden letters are N,E,F,T,S,H. A is not in that list. So ""craal"" is a possibility? But is it a common word? It's a South African word for an enclosure, but might be accepted.
- crabs: but S is forbidden? So no, because of S.
- crass: S is forbidden? So no.
- craws: S is forbidden? So no.
- craps: S is forbidden? So no.

So what about:
- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed.
- crawl: C R A W L -> W and L are allowed.
- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden.
- ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But ""crazy"" is 5 letters? C R A Z Y. Z and Y are not forbidden? But we haven't tested Z and Y? And the word is ""crazy"". But note: ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But we are missing the fourth and fifth? So ""crazy"" is a candidate? But let's check: C R A Z Y -> Z and Y.

But we must consider that the word might be less common? However, in Wordle, the word list is curated.

Other possibilities:
- ""crack"": C R A C K -> C and K. But note: we have a duplicate C? The first letter is C, and the fourth is C? Is that allowed? The feedback for ""crack"" as a guess: we haven't tried it. But the secret word might have duplicate C? However, we know the secret word has at least one C (at the beginning). If we guess ""crack"", and the secret word has only one C, then the fourth C would be marked as absent? Or would it be marked as present but wrong position? 

But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a dash. If it is not in the word at all, it gets an x. But if the secret word has only one C (at the beginning), then when we guess a C in the fourth position, that C is not in the word (because the only C is already used at the first position) so it should be marked as x? 

But in our case, we are not guessing ""crack"" yet. We are considering it as a candidate for the secret word. So if the secret word is ""crack"", then it has two C's? Then when we guessed ""crane"", we had one C (at the beginning) and it was marked correct. The other C in ""crack"" (at the fourth) was not guessed in ""crane"", so we didn't get feedback for it. Similarly, in ""craft"" and ""crash"", we didn't guess a C in the fourth? So we don't know.

But for now, ""crack"" is a candidate? Because it has C, R, A in the first three? And the last two are C and K? And C and K are not in the forbidden list? But wait, the forbidden list is N,E,F,T,S,H. C is not forbidden? But we already have a C? So duplicate C is allowed? And K is not forbidden? So ""crack"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""cramp"", ""crawl"", ""crazy"", ""craal"", and also ""crapy"" (if accepted? meaning resembling crape? but might be offensive? or ""crape"" is 5? no, crape is 5: C R A P E? but E is forbidden? so no).

So possible words:
1. cramp: C R A M P
2. crawl: C R A W L
3. crack: C R A C K
4. crazy: C R A Z Y
5. craal: C R A A L

We need to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information? But we have only two positions to figure out, and we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have 3 more guesses? Because we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6, we used 3, so 3 left.

But we can try to cover more letters? However, we are constrained by the fixed ""CRA"".

We can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common? For example, ""cramp"" uses M and P? ""crawl"" uses W and L? ""crazy"" uses Z and Y? ""crack"" uses C and K? ""craal"" uses A and L? But A is already known? So we might not get new information about other letters.

So let's avoid ""craal"" because it reuses A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But we are testing the fourth position? But we already know A is in the third? So if we get a check for A in the fourth? Then we know it's duplicated? But we are not sure? However, we want to test letters we haven't tried? So we can try ""cramp"" or ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

But note: we haven't tested M, P, W, L, Z, Y, C (in fourth), K.

But we have already tested C? But only in the first position? We haven't tested C in the fourth? So it's a new position? But we know the word has at least one C? So if we put C in the fourth? And if it's not there? We get an x? Then we know there is no duplicate C? If we get a dash? Then it would mean the C is in the word but not in the fourth? But the only other position is the fifth? Or if the word has more than two C's? But unlikely.

But to avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid ""crack"" for now? Because it has a duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicates are present.

Similarly, ""craal"" has duplicate A? So we avoid that too.

So we are left with:
- cramp: M and P
- crawl: W and L
- crazy: Z and Y

Which one to choose? We can choose ""cramp"" because M and P are more common than W, L, Z, Y? Or ""crawl"" because W and L are also common? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be one of these? So we can guess one of them.

I think ""cramp"" is a good choice? Because M and P are common? And if it's not, we get feedback on M and P? Then we can proceed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possible words? But we don't have many words left? Only a few.

Let me list the possible words again without duplicates? We have:

- cramp
- crawl
- crazy
- crack (if we consider it, but duplicate C)
- craal (duplicate A)

But we can also have:
- ""crawb""? not a word.
- ""crawd""? not a word.
- ""crawp""? not a word.

So the main ones are cramp, crawl, crazy, and maybe crack and craal.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? But we are avoiding craal? And M and P only in cramp? W only in crawl? Z and Y only in crazy? So no overlap? Then we have to pick one.

I think we should pick ""cramp"" because it's a very common word.

So let's guess ""cramp"".

If the feedback is:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(?), P(?)

If M is correct and P is correct? Then we win.

If M is correct and P is wrong? Then we know the fourth letter is M? And the fifth is not P? And we can try other letters for fifth? But we know the fifth is not N,E,F,T,S,H? And not P? So we try L, W, Z, Y, etc.

Similarly, if M is wrong? Then we get x for M? Then we know M is not in the word? Then we can eliminate ""cramp"" and consider the others.

So I'll go with ""cramp"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → The secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates F and T.
- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates S and H.

The secret word is **C R A _ _** , with the last two letters being unknown. The eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H**. Possible letters for positions 4 and 5 include common consonants like M, P, W, L, Z, Y, K, or vowels like O, U, I (but note the word must be valid and start with ""CRA"").

### Key Insights:
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""CRA"" and avoiding the eliminated letters.
- Common candidates include: 
  - **cramp** (tests M and P)
  - **crawl** (tests W and L)
  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)
  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K, but duplicate letters add complexity).
- I chose **""cramp""** for this guess because:
  - It tests two new, common consonants (M and P) not yet attempted.
  - It avoids eliminated letters and reusing known letters (like A) in untested positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will clearly indicate whether M or P are present and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if M is correct, we focus on position 5; if both are wrong, we eliminate M and P).

<guess>cramp</guess>",cramp,"We have the following feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - The word starts with ""CRA"", and does not contain N or E.

2. ""craft"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and F and T are not in the word.

3. ""crash"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and S and H are not in the word.

So, the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and the missing two letters are not any of: N, E, F, T, S, H.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that does not contain the forbidden letters: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Let's list possible letters for the last two positions. The available letters are from the alphabet excluding:
- C, R, A (which are already in the word, but note: they might appear again? However, we haven't been told they can't, but we have to consider the feedback: the feedback for the first three are correct, but we don't know about duplicates. However, the feedback for the last two in ""crash"" said S and H are absent, so they are not in the word at all, even as duplicates? The feedback marks a letter as absent (x) if it is not in the word at all. So if the word had an S, but we guessed it in the wrong position, it would be marked with a dash (-). But in ""crash"", the S and H are marked as (x), meaning they are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Also, we know the first three letters are C, R, A, so the word is ""C R A X Y"", where X and Y are letters not in {N, E, F, T, S, H}.

Now, what are the possible words?

Common words that start with ""CRA"" and are 5 letters:

- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed? M and P are not in the forbidden list.
- craw: but ""craw"" is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
- crawl: but that's 5 letters? C R A W L -> but we have W and L? Are they forbidden? No, W and L are not in the forbidden list. But wait, ""crawl"" has 5 letters: C-R-A-W-L? Yes.
- craze: but E is forbidden? Yes, so no.
- craal: C R A A L -> A is already in the word? But we are allowed duplicates? However, the feedback hasn't indicated that A is duplicated? But it's possible. And A is not forbidden? But we have to check: the forbidden letters are N,E,F,T,S,H. A is not in that list. So ""craal"" is a possibility? But is it a common word? It's a South African word for an enclosure, but might be accepted.
- crabs: but S is forbidden? So no, because of S.
- crass: S is forbidden? So no.
- craws: S is forbidden? So no.
- craps: S is forbidden? So no.

So what about:
- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed.
- crawl: C R A W L -> W and L are allowed.
- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden.
- ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But ""crazy"" is 5 letters? C R A Z Y. Z and Y are not forbidden? But we haven't tested Z and Y? And the word is ""crazy"". But note: ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But we are missing the fourth and fifth? So ""crazy"" is a candidate? But let's check: C R A Z Y -> Z and Y.

But we must consider that the word might be less common? However, in Wordle, the word list is curated.

Other possibilities:
- ""crack"": C R A C K -> C and K. But note: we have a duplicate C? The first letter is C, and the fourth is C? Is that allowed? The feedback for ""crack"" as a guess: we haven't tried it. But the secret word might have duplicate C? However, we know the secret word has at least one C (at the beginning). If we guess ""crack"", and the secret word has only one C, then the fourth C would be marked as absent? Or would it be marked as present but wrong position? 

But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a dash. If it is not in the word at all, it gets an x. But if the secret word has only one C (at the beginning), then when we guess a C in the fourth position, that C is not in the word (because the only C is already used at the first position) so it should be marked as x? 

But in our case, we are not guessing ""crack"" yet. We are considering it as a candidate for the secret word. So if the secret word is ""crack"", then it has two C's? Then when we guessed ""crane"", we had one C (at the beginning) and it was marked correct. The other C in ""crack"" (at the fourth) was not guessed in ""crane"", so we didn't get feedback for it. Similarly, in ""craft"" and ""crash"", we didn't guess a C in the fourth? So we don't know.

But for now, ""crack"" is a candidate? Because it has C, R, A in the first three? And the last two are C and K? And C and K are not in the forbidden list? But wait, the forbidden list is N,E,F,T,S,H. C is not forbidden? But we already have a C? So duplicate C is allowed? And K is not forbidden? So ""crack"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""cramp"", ""crawl"", ""crazy"", ""craal"", and also ""crapy"" (if accepted? meaning resembling crape? but might be offensive? or ""crape"" is 5? no, crape is 5: C R A P E? but E is forbidden? so no).

So possible words:
1. cramp: C R A M P
2. crawl: C R A W L
3. crack: C R A C K
4. crazy: C R A Z Y
5. craal: C R A A L

We need to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information? But we have only two positions to figure out, and we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have 3 more guesses? Because we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6, we used 3, so 3 left.

But we can try to cover more letters? However, we are constrained by the fixed ""CRA"".

We can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common? For example, ""cramp"" uses M and P? ""crawl"" uses W and L? ""crazy"" uses Z and Y? ""crack"" uses C and K? ""craal"" uses A and L? But A is already known? So we might not get new information about other letters.

So let's avoid ""craal"" because it reuses A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But we are testing the fourth position? But we already know A is in the third? So if we get a check for A in the fourth? Then we know it's duplicated? But we are not sure? However, we want to test letters we haven't tried? So we can try ""cramp"" or ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

But note: we haven't tested M, P, W, L, Z, Y, C (in fourth), K.

But we have already tested C? But only in the first position? We haven't tested C in the fourth? So it's a new position? But we know the word has at least one C? So if we put C in the fourth? And if it's not there? We get an x? Then we know there is no duplicate C? If we get a dash? Then it would mean the C is in the word but not in the fourth? But the only other position is the fifth? Or if the word has more than two C's? But unlikely.

But to avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid ""crack"" for now? Because it has a duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicates are present.

Similarly, ""craal"" has duplicate A? So we avoid that too.

So we are left with:
- cramp: M and P
- crawl: W and L
- crazy: Z and Y

Which one to choose? We can choose ""cramp"" because M and P are more common than W, L, Z, Y? Or ""crawl"" because W and L are also common? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be one of these? So we can guess one of them.

I think ""cramp"" is a good choice? Because M and P are common? And if it's not, we get feedback on M and P? Then we can proceed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possible words? But we don't have many words left? Only a few.

Let me list the possible words again without duplicates? We have:

- cramp
- crawl
- crazy
- crack (if we consider it, but duplicate C)
- craal (duplicate A)

But we can also have:
- ""crawb""? not a word.
- ""crawd""? not a word.
- ""crawp""? not a word.

So the main ones are cramp, crawl, crazy, and maybe crack and craal.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? But we are avoiding craal? And M and P only in cramp? W only in crawl? Z and Y only in crazy? So no overlap? Then we have to pick one.

I think we should pick ""cramp"" because it's a very common word.

So let's guess ""cramp"".

If the feedback is:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(?), P(?)

If M is correct and P is correct? Then we win.

If M is correct and P is wrong? Then we know the fourth letter is M? And the fifth is not P? And we can try other letters for fifth? But we know the fifth is not N,E,F,T,S,H? And not P? So we try L, W, Z, Y, etc.

Similarly, if M is wrong? Then we get x for M? Then we know M is not in the word? Then we can eliminate ""cramp"" and consider the others.

So I'll go with ""cramp"".After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → The secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates F and T.
- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates S and H.

The secret word is **C R A _ _** , with the last two letters being unknown. The eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H**. Possible letters for positions 4 and 5 include common consonants like M, P, W, L, Z, Y, K, or vowels like O, U, I (but note the word must be valid and start with ""CRA"").

### Key Insights:
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""CRA"" and avoiding the eliminated letters.
- Common candidates include: 
  - **cramp** (tests M and P)
  - **crawl** (tests W and L)
  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)
  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K, but duplicate letters add complexity).
- I chose **""cramp""** for this guess because:
  - It tests two new, common consonants (M and P) not yet attempted.
  - It avoids eliminated letters and reusing known letters (like A) in untested positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will clearly indicate whether M or P are present and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if M is correct, we focus on position 5; if both are wrong, we eliminate M and P).",Guess 4: cramp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 Let's use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C, R, and A are in the secret word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: C R A _ _

 We know the first three letters are C, R, A in that order.

 The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not N or E.

 Also, since N and E are not in the word, we must avoid any word that contains N or E.

 We have to guess a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRA"" and the last two letters are not N or E, and also the entire word must not contain N or E.

 Let's think of words that start with ""CRA"":

 Common words: 
   crab, crag, cram, crap, craw, cray, craal, craic (but craic is 5 letters? Actually, craic is 5: C-R-A-I-C? Wait, but we need 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed but in this case we have constraints.)

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the first three are correct, so the word is C R A ? ?

 We must avoid N and E.

 Let's list possible words:

 - crab: ends with B -> C R A B (but that's 4 letters? Wait, crab is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.)

 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"":

 - craal: not common, but it's a word? (a type of enclosure) -> C R A A L -> but has two A's? The third letter is A and we have another A? That might be acceptable if the word has two A's? However, in our feedback, we only know that the first A is in the correct position. The word might have another A? But we don't have any information about that.

 - craic: (Irish term) -> C R A I C -> but note that the last letter is C. However, we already have a C at the beginning? That's acceptable.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had a C in the first position and it was correct. Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C's? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?

 Important: The feedback rules don't specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C's, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn't guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn't get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present. So if the secret word were ""craic"", then the fifth letter is C, not E, so E being absent is correct. But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn't guess, so we don't know about it.

 But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list? It might be considered a proper noun or slang. We should stick to more common words.

 Let's look for other words:

 - cramp: but we have to avoid E? No, cramp has no E? Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.

 - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.

 - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.

 - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.

 - crass: C R A S S -> has two S's? But we don't know about S.

 - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.

 - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.

 - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.

 - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.

 - craze: has E? Forbidden.

 - craal: C R A A L -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's? But it's acceptable.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn't contain N or E.

 Let's list some possibilities:

 1. cramp
 2. crash
 3. crass
 4. craws
 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don't know about S)
 6. craal (if accepted)

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 We can also think of: 
   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.

 So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.

 However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.

 We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.

 But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.

 We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.

 For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.

 But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

 Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven't tried yet, especially common consonants.

 We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).

 We also know that the first three are C, R, A.

 We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.

 Let's choose ""crash"": 
   C R A S H

 If we get feedback:
   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.
   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it's in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.

   Similarly for H.

 However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S's. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an 'x' for H and also we would get a '-' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates?

 Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn't guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S's, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S's) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn't guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an 'x' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don't get any indication for that second S? That's a problem.

 Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: 
   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.
   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.

 But note: the secret word has two S's? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S's in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn't guess an S in the 5th, so we don't get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":
   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":
      C: ✓ (correct position)
      R: ✓ (correct position)
      A: ✓ (correct position)
      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.
      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.

   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)

   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)

   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.

 So in both cases, we get one x at the end.

 But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.

 Let's try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.

 So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.

 Possibilities: 
   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.
   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.
   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.
   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.

 However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.

 Let's choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven't tried them.

 So I will guess ""craft"".

 If the feedback for ""craft"" is:
   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)

 We hope to get information about the last two.

 But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.

 Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.

 However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that's not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.

 But let's see: if we get:
   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.
   T is x: then T is not in the word.

   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.

 Actually, the feedback is independent per position.

 Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.

   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)

   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.

 Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.

   Same as above.

 But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x's and we know the last two are not F or T.

 We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.

 So it's a good strategy.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.

 I think ""craft"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""craft"".

<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:
- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""
- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5
- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters
- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity

<guess>craft</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback from two guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.

So, we know:
- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _
- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits:
- Starts with ""CRA""
- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.
- Must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven't ruled that out yet.

But we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn't guess any duplicate letters, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.

Let's list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.

Common words:
- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".
- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.
- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it's a word.
- craws: C R A W S → W and S.
- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it's sometimes accepted. We'll consider common and acceptable words.
- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn't forbidden A from appearing again? So it's possible.

However, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn't guess another A? So it wouldn't show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it's possible.

But let's see which words we haven't tested letters for.

We need to choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information.

We have tested:
- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E
- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T

So we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).

We haven't tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.

Possible words:
- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.
- cramp: tests M and P.
- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven't tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.

But wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.

Also, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven't tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?

Other options:

We might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven't tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don't know if it's there.

But we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.

Let me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it's not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.

But since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.

Typically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me pick ""crash"": 
  C R A S H

If the feedback:
  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it's in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it's S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.

But then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that's a word.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.

But we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.

Let me list all possible common words that fit:

- cramp (M, P)
- crash (S, H)
- crass (S, S) → double S
- craws (W, S)
- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven't tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.
- crawl (W, L)
- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.
- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C's? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:
   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)
   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:
      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.
      Position2: R → ✓
      Position3: A → ✓
      Position4: I → ? 
      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C's? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:
         For the fifth C: if the secret's fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn't guess that position? It's messy.

I think ""craic"" is not a common choice.

We need to consider the information we gain.

If we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.

But if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, let's avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can't change them? The word must start with CRA.

So every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.

But the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.

Therefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried.

For example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it's unusual. Common words are better.

Common possibilities: 
   cramp: M and P
   crash: S and H
   crwth: not common? Skip.

Also, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".

""craze"" has E? Forbidden.

So valid ones without forbidden letters:

1. cramp: M and P
2. crash: S and H
3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)
4. craws: W and S
5. crabs: B and S
6. crawl: W and L
7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.
8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That's acceptable? But then we have two C's? And letter K? But we haven't ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?

But ""crack"": 
   C R A C K
   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:
      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn't have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:
        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn't have an additional C? So it would be x? But it's confusing.

To avoid complication, I'll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.

But for simplicity, try distinct letters.

So let's choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?

S is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.

Also, ""crash"" is a standard English word.

So I propose ""crash"".

If the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.

If not, the feedback from ""crash"": 
   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.

   Possible feedback:
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it's the secret.
   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.
   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven't tested D?

However, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.

But similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it's in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn't contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn't contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.

Then we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.

Similarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:
   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.

Both ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I'll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.

So the next guess: ""crash""After analyzing the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.

The secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". 

I chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:
- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".
- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.
- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).
- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.

<guess>crash</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)
Guess 3: crash -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x)
   - The word starts with ""CRA"", and does not contain N or E.

2. ""craft"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and F and T are not in the word.

3. ""crash"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x)
   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and S and H are not in the word.

So, the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and the missing two letters are not any of: N, E, F, T, S, H.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that does not contain the forbidden letters: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Let's list possible letters for the last two positions. The available letters are from the alphabet excluding:
- C, R, A (which are already in the word, but note: they might appear again? However, we haven't been told they can't, but we have to consider the feedback: the feedback for the first three are correct, but we don't know about duplicates. However, the feedback for the last two in ""crash"" said S and H are absent, so they are not in the word at all, even as duplicates? The feedback marks a letter as absent (x) if it is not in the word at all. So if the word had an S, but we guessed it in the wrong position, it would be marked with a dash (-). But in ""crash"", the S and H are marked as (x), meaning they are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain: N, E, F, T, S, H.

Also, we know the first three letters are C, R, A, so the word is ""C R A X Y"", where X and Y are letters not in {N, E, F, T, S, H}.

Now, what are the possible words?

Common words that start with ""CRA"" and are 5 letters:

- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed? M and P are not in the forbidden list.
- craw: but ""craw"" is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
- crawl: but that's 5 letters? C R A W L -> but we have W and L? Are they forbidden? No, W and L are not in the forbidden list. But wait, ""crawl"" has 5 letters: C-R-A-W-L? Yes.
- craze: but E is forbidden? Yes, so no.
- craal: C R A A L -> A is already in the word? But we are allowed duplicates? However, the feedback hasn't indicated that A is duplicated? But it's possible. And A is not forbidden? But we have to check: the forbidden letters are N,E,F,T,S,H. A is not in that list. So ""craal"" is a possibility? But is it a common word? It's a South African word for an enclosure, but might be accepted.
- crabs: but S is forbidden? So no, because of S.
- crass: S is forbidden? So no.
- craws: S is forbidden? So no.
- craps: S is forbidden? So no.

So what about:
- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed.
- crawl: C R A W L -> W and L are allowed.
- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden.
- ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But ""crazy"" is 5 letters? C R A Z Y. Z and Y are not forbidden? But we haven't tested Z and Y? And the word is ""crazy"". But note: ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But we are missing the fourth and fifth? So ""crazy"" is a candidate? But let's check: C R A Z Y -> Z and Y.

But we must consider that the word might be less common? However, in Wordle, the word list is curated.

Other possibilities:
- ""crack"": C R A C K -> C and K. But note: we have a duplicate C? The first letter is C, and the fourth is C? Is that allowed? The feedback for ""crack"" as a guess: we haven't tried it. But the secret word might have duplicate C? However, we know the secret word has at least one C (at the beginning). If we guess ""crack"", and the secret word has only one C, then the fourth C would be marked as absent? Or would it be marked as present but wrong position? 

But note: the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a dash. If it is not in the word at all, it gets an x. But if the secret word has only one C (at the beginning), then when we guess a C in the fourth position, that C is not in the word (because the only C is already used at the first position) so it should be marked as x? 

But in our case, we are not guessing ""crack"" yet. We are considering it as a candidate for the secret word. So if the secret word is ""crack"", then it has two C's? Then when we guessed ""crane"", we had one C (at the beginning) and it was marked correct. The other C in ""crack"" (at the fourth) was not guessed in ""crane"", so we didn't get feedback for it. Similarly, in ""craft"" and ""crash"", we didn't guess a C in the fourth? So we don't know.

But for now, ""crack"" is a candidate? Because it has C, R, A in the first three? And the last two are C and K? And C and K are not in the forbidden list? But wait, the forbidden list is N,E,F,T,S,H. C is not forbidden? But we already have a C? So duplicate C is allowed? And K is not forbidden? So ""crack"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""cramp"", ""crawl"", ""crazy"", ""craal"", and also ""crapy"" (if accepted? meaning resembling crape? but might be offensive? or ""crape"" is 5? no, crape is 5: C R A P E? but E is forbidden? so no).

So possible words:
1. cramp: C R A M P
2. crawl: C R A W L
3. crack: C R A C K
4. crazy: C R A Z Y
5. craal: C R A A L

We need to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information? But we have only two positions to figure out, and we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have 3 more guesses? Because we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6, we used 3, so 3 left.

But we can try to cover more letters? However, we are constrained by the fixed ""CRA"".

We can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common? For example, ""cramp"" uses M and P? ""crawl"" uses W and L? ""crazy"" uses Z and Y? ""crack"" uses C and K? ""craal"" uses A and L? But A is already known? So we might not get new information about other letters.

So let's avoid ""craal"" because it reuses A? We don't know if A is duplicated? But we are testing the fourth position? But we already know A is in the third? So if we get a check for A in the fourth? Then we know it's duplicated? But we are not sure? However, we want to test letters we haven't tried? So we can try ""cramp"" or ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

But note: we haven't tested M, P, W, L, Z, Y, C (in fourth), K.

But we have already tested C? But only in the first position? We haven't tested C in the fourth? So it's a new position? But we know the word has at least one C? So if we put C in the fourth? And if it's not there? We get an x? Then we know there is no duplicate C? If we get a dash? Then it would mean the C is in the word but not in the fourth? But the only other position is the fifth? Or if the word has more than two C's? But unlikely.

But to avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid ""crack"" for now? Because it has a duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicates are present.

Similarly, ""craal"" has duplicate A? So we avoid that too.

So we are left with:
- cramp: M and P
- crawl: W and L
- crazy: Z and Y

Which one to choose? We can choose ""cramp"" because M and P are more common than W, L, Z, Y? Or ""crawl"" because W and L are also common? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be one of these? So we can guess one of them.

I think ""cramp"" is a good choice? Because M and P are common? And if it's not, we get feedback on M and P? Then we can proceed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possible words? But we don't have many words left? Only a few.

Let me list the possible words again without duplicates? We have:

- cramp
- crawl
- crazy
- crack (if we consider it, but duplicate C)
- craal (duplicate A)

But we can also have:
- ""crawb""? not a word.
- ""crawd""? not a word.
- ""crawp""? not a word.

So the main ones are cramp, crawl, crazy, and maybe crack and craal.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? But we are avoiding craal? And M and P only in cramp? W only in crawl? Z and Y only in crazy? So no overlap? Then we have to pick one.

I think we should pick ""cramp"" because it's a very common word.

So let's guess ""cramp"".

If the feedback is:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(?), P(?)

If M is correct and P is correct? Then we win.

If M is correct and P is wrong? Then we know the fourth letter is M? And the fifth is not P? And we can try other letters for fifth? But we know the fifth is not N,E,F,T,S,H? And not P? So we try L, W, Z, Y, etc.

Similarly, if M is wrong? Then we get x for M? Then we know M is not in the word? Then we can eliminate ""cramp"" and consider the others.

So I'll go with ""cramp"".After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → The secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.
- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates F and T.
- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates S and H.

The secret word is **C R A _ _** , with the last two letters being unknown. The eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H**. Possible letters for positions 4 and 5 include common consonants like M, P, W, L, Z, Y, K, or vowels like O, U, I (but note the word must be valid and start with ""CRA"").

### Key Insights:
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""CRA"" and avoiding the eliminated letters.
- Common candidates include: 
  - **cramp** (tests M and P)
  - **crawl** (tests W and L)
  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)
  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K, but duplicate letters add complexity).
- I chose **""cramp""** for this guess because:
  - It tests two new, common consonants (M and P) not yet attempted.
  - It avoids eliminated letters and reusing known letters (like A) in untested positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will clearly indicate whether M or P are present and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if M is correct, we focus on position 5; if both are wrong, we eliminate M and P).

Now, if the secret word is ""craic"", then the last letter is also C. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", the first C was marked correct (which it is) but the word ""craic"" has two C\'s? How would the feedback work for a duplicate letter?\n\n Important: The feedback rules don\'t specify how duplicates are handled, but typically in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence independently. However, in our case, the first guess ""crane"" had only one C. So if the secret word has two C\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" (which has one C in the first position), we would get a check for the first C, but the second C in the secret word (at the end) would not be revealed because we didn\'t guess a letter in that position? Actually, no: the feedback only considers the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess a letter in the fifth position that is C, we wouldn\'t get any indication of the second C. But the feedback for the C we did guess is correct.\n\n However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" also had an E at the end that was marked as not present.

But also, the fourth letter in ""craic"" is I, which we didn\'t guess, so we don\'t know about it.\n\n But we have a problem: the word ""craic"" is not in the standard word list?

Wait, but we also have to avoid N? Cramp: C R A M P -> no N or E. But the feedback for ""crane"" had N in the fourth position? We know N is not in the word at all. So cramp is acceptable? However, cramp is 5 letters? Yes.\n\n - cramp: C R A M P -> but the fourth letter is M and fifth is P.\n\n - cramps is 6, so cramp is 5.\n\n - crash: C R A S H -> no N or E.\n\n - crass: C R A S S -> has two S\'s? But we don\'t know about S.\n\n - crate: but we cannot use because it has E? Yes, E is forbidden.\n\n - crave: has E? Yes, so forbidden.\n\n - craws: C R A W S -> no N or E.\n\n - cray: is 4 letters? Cray is 4, but we have crayfishes? Not 5.\n\n - craze: has E? Forbidden.\n\n - craal: C R A A L -> has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? But it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we must choose a word that is valid and doesn\'t contain N or E.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities:\n\n 1. cramp\n 2. crash\n 3. crass\n 4. craws\n 5. craps (but that might be considered offensive? and also has S? but we don\'t know about S)\n 6. craal (if accepted)\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n We can also think of: \n   craft -> but craft has F and T? and no N or E? Yes, craft: C R A F T.\n\n So possible words: craft, cramp, crash, crass, craws, etc.\n\n However, we have to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\n We know the first three letters are fixed. We only need to figure out the last two.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many letters as possible.\n\n But note: we are constrained by the absence of N and E.\n\n We can try a word that uses common letters for the last two positions to get more information.\n\n For example, if we guess ""crash"", then we are testing S and H.\n\n But we might also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\n Since we have three letters fixed, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven\'t tried yet, especially common consonants.\n\n We already know that the secret word does not contain: N, E (from the first guess).\n\n We also know that the first three are C, R, A.\n\n We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can try to use a word that has two new letters that are common.\n\n Let\'s choose ""crash"": \n   C R A S H\n\n If we get feedback:\n   If the S is in the correct position (4th) and H in the correct position (5th), then we have the word.\n   If S is present but in wrong position? But we are putting it in the 4th, so if it\'s in the word but not in 4th, then it must be in 5th? But wait, the word has only 5 letters and the first three are fixed. So the only positions left are 4 and 5.\n\n   Similarly for H.\n\n However, note: the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word is ""crass"", then it has two S\'s. But in ""crash"", we are only putting one S in the 4th position. So if the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we would get an \'x\' for H and also we would get a \'-\' for the S? Actually, no: because the secret word has two S\'s? How does the feedback handle duplicates?\n\n Let me recall: in the standard Wordle, if you guess a letter once and it appears twice in the secret word, then if one of them is in the correct position, it gets a check, and the other occurrence (if you didn\'t guess it in the correct position) might get a dash? But in our case, we only guessed one S. So if the secret word has two S\'s, then the S we guessed in the 4th position (if that is one of the S\'s) would get a check, and the other S in the 5th position would not be accounted for because we didn\'t guess a letter in the 5th that is S? Actually, we guessed H in the 5th, which is not S, so we get an \'x\' for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? Then we should get a dash for the S in the 4th? Wait, no: the feedback for the S we guessed in the 4th would be a check because it is in the correct position? And the 5th letter we guessed H, which is not S, so we get an x for H. But the secret word has an S in the 5th? That S is not matched by any guess? So we don\'t get any indication for that second S? That\'s a problem.\n\n Actually, the rules: the feedback is per letter in the guess. For the S in the 4th position: \n   - If the secret word has an S in the 4th, then we get a check.\n   - If the secret word does not have an S in the 4th, but has an S elsewhere (like the 5th), then we get a dash.\n\n But note: the secret word has two S\'s? Then if we guess only one S, then we get a dash for that S if it matches one of the S\'s in the secret word (but not in the correct position). However, in our guess ""crash"", we put S in the 4th. If the secret word is ""crass"", then the 4th letter is S (so we get a check) and the 5th letter is S. But we didn\'t guess an S in the 5th, so we don\'t get any feedback for the 5th S? The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n So in the case of ""crash"" vs ""crass"":\n   For ""crash"" as a guess when the secret word is ""crass"":\n      C: ✓ (correct position)\n      R: ✓ (correct position)\n      A: ✓ (correct position)\n      S: ✓ (because the 4th letter in secret is S) -> so we get a check for S.\n      H: x (because the 5th letter in secret is S, not H) -> so we get an x.\n\n   So the feedback would be: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(x)\n\n   But that would indicate that the first four are correct and the last is wrong. So we would know the word is ""cras?"" and we need to change the last letter? But we know the last letter must be a letter that is not H and not N or E. And we might try ""crass"" next? But we have limited tries.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""crass"" and the secret is ""crash"", then:\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S: in the 4th position? The secret has S in the 4th? No, the secret is ""crash"": so the 4th is S? Wait, both ""crash"" and ""crass"" have S in the 4th? Then for ""crass"" as a guess when secret is ""crash"":\n      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(✓) (because 4th is S in both), and then the 5th: we guessed S, but the secret has H -> so we get an x for the last S? But wait, the secret word ""crash"" has only one S? So the S we guessed in the 5th is not in the word? So we get an x.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(✓) S(x)\n\n   This would tell us that the 5th letter is not S, but we have an S in the 4th? So we know the word is ""cras?"" and the last letter is not S.\n\n So in both cases, we get one x at the end.\n\n But we want to maximize information. We might consider a word that has two new letters that are different.\n\n Let\'s try to avoid duplicate letters in our guess to avoid confusion.\n\n So we can choose a word that has two distinct new letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n   craft: C R A F T -> letters F and T.\n   cramp: C R A M P -> M and P.\n   crash: C R A S H -> S and H.\n   craws: C R A W S -> W and S (but S is repeated? No, craws: C R A W S -> distinct? C, R, A, W, S -> distinct? Yes, but we have W and S.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? But we are avoiding duplicates in our guess to get clearer feedback.\n\n Let\'s choose ""craft"" because it uses two common consonants (F and T) and we haven\'t tried them.\n\n So I will guess ""craft"".\n\n If the feedback for ""craft"" is:\n   C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(?) T(?)\n\n We hope to get information about the last two.\n\n But note: the secret word might be ""craft"" itself? Then we win.\n\n Alternatively, if F is in the word but in the wrong position? But the only positions left are 4 and 5, so if F is in the word, it must be in the 4th or 5th? But we are putting it in the 4th. So if we get a dash for F, that would mean F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? Similarly for T.\n\n However, the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the secret word is ""craff"" (but that\'s not a word) or ""craft"" is the only common one.\n\n But let\'s see: if we get:\n   F is x: then F is not in the word at all.\n   T is x: then T is not in the word.\n\n   F is dash: then F is in the word but not in the 4th? Then it must be in the 5th? But we have T in the 5th? Then if F is in the 5th, then we would have a conflict? Because we have T in the 5th? So if F is marked as dash, that means F is in the word but not in the 4th, so it must be in the 5th? Then the 5th letter of the secret is F, but we have T in the 5th? Then T would be marked as x? Because T is not in the word? Or if the word has both F and T? But we are guessing two different letters.\n\n Actually, the feedback is independent per position.\n\n Example: if the secret word is ""cramp"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: we put F in 4th, but secret has M -> so F is not in the word? Then we get x for F? But wait, the secret word ""cramp"" has no F? So F is x. Then T: we put T in 5th, but secret has P? So T is not in the word? So we get x for T.\n\n   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n\n   Then we know the last two letters are not F or T, and we also know they are not N or E. So we can try other letters.\n\n Alternatively, if the secret word is ""crash"", and we guess ""craft"":\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F: not in the word -> x, T: not in the word -> x.\n\n   Same as above.\n\n But if the secret word is ""cramp"", then we get two x\'s and we know the last two are not F or T.\n\n We can then try ""crash"" next? Then we test S and H.\n\n So it\'s a good strategy.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed first three.\n\n I think ""craft"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""craft"".\n\n<guess>craft</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where C, R, and A are correct and in position (✓), while N and E are absent (x), the secret word must start with ""CRA"" and cannot contain N or E. For the next guess, I chose ""craft"" because it:\n- Maintains the correct starting letters ""CRA""\n- Tests two new common consonants (F and T) in positions 4 and 5\n- Avoids N, E, and previously incorrect letters\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize feedback clarity\n\n<guess>craft</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback from two guesses:\n1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → This tells us the secret word starts with CRA, and does not contain N or E.\n2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → This confirms the first three letters are correct, and additionally tells us that F and T are not in the word.\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word is of the form C R A _ _\n- It does not contain: N, E, F, T.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits:\n- Starts with ""CRA""\n- The last two letters are two different letters (or possibly the same) that are not among N, E, F, T.\n- Must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible letters for the last two positions: We can rule out the known absent letters (N,E,F,T) and also the ones we know are present but in fixed positions (C,R,A). However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? We haven\'t ruled that out yet.\n\nBut we have only two positions to fill (4th and 5th). The word must not include N, E, F, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested many letters yet. We can consider common consonants and vowels? The letter A is already used in the third position, but perhaps it appears again? The feedback from ""crane"" and ""craft"" only told us about the letters we guessed. Since we didn\'t guess any duplicate letters, we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. However, in position 4 and 5, we can have repeats.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that start with ""CRA"" and avoid N, E, F, T.\n\nCommon words:\n- cramp: C R A M P → M and P are allowed (not excluded). Also, the word is ""cramp"".\n- crash: C R A S H → S and H are allowed.\n- crass: C R A S S → S and S. Note the double S, but it\'s a word.\n- craws: C R A W S → W and S.\n- craps: C R A P S → P and S. But note ""crap"" may be vulgar? However, in word games, it\'s sometimes accepted. We\'ll consider common and acceptable words.\n- craal: C R A A L → A and L. But note: we have an A in the third position. If we use craal, the fourth letter is A? That would be a duplicate A. Our feedback hasn\'t forbidden A from appearing again? So it\'s possible.\n\nHowever, in ""craal"", if the secret word has two A\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had an A in the correct position (third) and we didn\'t guess another A? So it wouldn\'t show. Similarly, in ""craft"", no A in the last two. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see which words we haven\'t tested letters for.\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet to get more information.\n\nWe have tested:\n- In guess1: C, R, A, N, E\n- In guess2: C, R, A, F, T\n\nSo we know about C,R,A (present and correct), N,E,F,T (absent).\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B,D,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut note: the last two positions, so we can choose a word that has two new letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible words:\n- crash: tests S and H → if both are correct, we win. If S is correct and H is absent, we know the 5th letter is missing H. If S is absent then we rule out S, etc.\n- cramp: tests M and P.\n- crawl: but wait, ""crawl"" has W and L? And note, we haven\'t tested W and L. But crawl: C R A W L → but the fourth letter is W and fifth is L.\n\nBut wait, ""crawl"" is C R A W L. Is that a word? Yes.\n\nAlso, we can do ""crabs"" but that has B? And we haven\'t tested B. But also, if the secret word is C R A _ _, and we include an S? Or B?\n\nOther options:\n\nWe might avoid words that reuse A? Because we already know A? But we can reuse? However, we haven\'t tested A in other positions? Actually, in the third position we have A, but if we put A in the fourth? We don\'t know if it\'s there.\n\nBut we are limited: we are trying to fill positions 4 and 5.\n\nLet me think: the word ""craal"" has A in the fourth position? So we can try ""craal"" to test if the fourth letter is A? But if it\'s not, we get an x? If it is, we get a check.\n\nBut since we have more tries, we can try to cover more ground.\n\nTypically, we would want a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nLet me pick ""crash"": \n  C R A S H\n\nIf the feedback:\n  Fourth letter: if S is correct, we get ✓. If S is in the word but not in fourth? Well, since the word must be C R A X Y, and if S is in the fifth? Then we would have a dash for S? Because we put S in fourth and it\'s in fifth? And H would be x? Because we put H in fifth but it\'s S? Then we get: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(-) H(x) → meaning S is in the word but not in fourth? And not H? So the word would be C R A ? S → because S must be in fifth.\n\nBut then we can form words like ""crams"" (if M were present? But no, ""crams"" ends with S) but ""crams"" has M? Not S? Wait: C R A M S → that\'s a word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""cramp"": C R A M P → tests M and P.\n\nBut we might end up with less information if we choose a word that happens to be correct? We have to make a guess anyway.\n\nLet me list all possible common words that fit:\n\n- cramp (M, P)\n- crash (S, H)\n- crass (S, S) → double S\n- craws (W, S)\n- crabs (B, S) → but crabs has S? And we haven\'t tested B and S? But also, note that ""crabs"" ends with S? It is a word.\n- crawl (W, L)\n- craal (A, L) → tests A again? And L.\n- craic (I, C) → but C is already at the beginning? And we know C is at beginning? So would the C at the end be allowed? But note, ""craic"" has two C\'s? And in feedback, if we guess C in a position? But in ""craic"", if we use it: C R A I C? Then the last letter is C. However, we have already been told that the first C is correct. When we guess ""craic"", we would have:\n   First C: ✓ (because same position as secret)\n   But what about the last C? The secret word has C at the beginning? If the secret word also has C at the end? Then we would get:\n      Position1: C in secret, so ✓.\n      Position2: R → ✓\n      Position3: A → ✓\n      Position4: I → ? \n      Position5: C → if the secret word does not have a second C? Then we might get only one ✓ for the first C? But if the secret word has two C\'s? Then if we guess C at the fifth, then:\n         For the fifth C: if the secret\'s fifth letter is C, then ✓. Otherwise, if the secret has a C elsewhere? But we didn\'t guess that position? It\'s messy.\n\nI think ""craic"" is not a common choice.\n\nWe need to consider the information we gain.\n\nIf we choose a word that has two distinct new letters, we rule them in or out.\n\nBut if we choose a word that has one letter we already know? Not efficient.\n\nTherefore, let\'s avoid reusing known letters? But the known letters C, R, A are fixed in the first three, so they will be in every guess? But we can\'t change them? The word must start with CRA.\n\nSo every guess will have C, R, A in the first three positions. Therefore, the guess will inevitably have these three letters.\n\nBut the fourth and fifth positions can be any unused letters? And we want to test new ones.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that uses two letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nFor example: ""crwth"" is a word? But it\'s unusual. Common words are better.\n\nCommon possibilities: \n   cramp: M and P\n   crash: S and H\n   crwth: not common? Skip.\n\nAlso, ""crave"" has V and E? But E is forbidden? So not ""crave"".\n\n""craze"" has E? Forbidden.\n\nSo valid ones without forbidden letters:\n\n1. cramp: M and P\n2. crash: S and H\n3. crass: S and S (so two positions with S)\n4. craws: W and S\n5. crabs: B and S\n6. crawl: W and L\n7. creed? But starts with CRE? Not CRA.\n8. crack? has C? And K? But wait, ""crack"" starts with C R A? But ""crack"" is C R A C K. That\'s acceptable? But then we have two C\'s? And letter K? But we haven\'t ruled out C and K? But we already know C is at the beginning? So in the fourth position we are putting C? That would test if the secret word has C at the fourth? Which is possible? And fifth letter K?\n\nBut ""crack"": \n   C R A C K\n   If the secret word is ""crack"", then:\n      First C: ✓, R: ✓, A: ✓, fourth C: ✓ (if secret has C there)? But what if the secret word doesn\'t have a duplicate C? Then for the fourth C: since we already have a C at the beginning? And the secret has C only at the beginning? But we are putting C in the fourth? Then:\n        The fourth letter we guess C, and if the secret has no C in fourth? Then we would get a dash? Because there is a C in the secret? But at the beginning? Then we already used that C for the first position? So the fourth C would not get a dash? Because the secret doesn\'t have an additional C? So it would be x? But it\'s confusing.\n\nTo avoid complication, I\'ll avoid words with duplicate letters for now? But we cannot always avoid.\n\nBut for simplicity, try distinct letters.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""crash"" or ""cramp"". Which uses more common letters? S and H are common? Or M and P?\n\nS is a very common letter? Then ""crash"" is a good choice.\n\nAlso, ""crash"" is a standard English word.\n\nSo I propose ""crash"".\n\nIf the secret word is ""crash"", then we win.\n\nIf not, the feedback from ""crash"": \n   We are putting S in fourth and H in fifth.\n\n   Possible feedback:\n   - If S is correct (fourth) and H is correct (fifth): then the word is ""crash"" → but we only get that if it\'s the secret.\n   - If S is correct (fourth) and H not used: then we get H(x) → meaning fifth letter is wrong? Then we try another with fourth fixed as S and fifth not H.\n   - If S is not correct? But it might be present elsewhere? Since the word must start with CRA, the only other spot is fifth? So if we get S as dash for the fourth position? This would mean S is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter must be S? Then we form C R A ? S? Then we try words like ""crams"", ""cards""? But wait, D and S? But we haven\'t tested D?\n\nHowever, the fifth letter would be S? Then we can try a word ending with S? But we fixed the first three? So only the fourth is missing? So we can try letters for the fourth? But we have more than one option? For example, C R A B S? crabs? Or C R A M S? crams? Etc.\n\nBut similarly, if H is either dash or check? But if S is dash (meaning it\'s in fifth), then the fifth is S? Then the word ends with S? And we put H in fifth? Actually, in this guess, we put S in fourth and H in fifth? If S is dash, then we know S is not in fourth? So S must be in fifth? Then the fifth letter is S? And the fourth letter is something else? Also, we get H marked? We put H in fifth? So if fifth is S? Then H is wrong? So H is not in the word? So we get H(x)? Then we would know the word is C R A _ S? And the fourth letter is not S? And we know the word doesn\'t contain H? Also, from previous, it doesn\'t contain N,E,F,T? So letters like B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible? But we must have a 5-letter word.\n\nThen we would try a word like ""crams"" (if M is the fourth) or ""craws"" (if W) or ""crabs"" (if B)? Etc.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""cramp"", we might get:\n   Either M correct? Then we look for fifth? Etc.\n\nBoth ""crash"" and ""cramp"" are good. I\'ll choose ""crash"" because it tests two very common letters.\n\nSo the next guess: ""crash""After analyzing the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) confirms the secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.\n- From Guess 2 (""craft""): C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) reinforces the first three letters and eliminates F and T.\n\nThe secret word is ""CRA"" followed by two unknown letters that cannot be N, E, F, or T. Possible words include ""cramp"", ""crash"", ""crass"", ""crawl"", ""craws"", or ""crabs"". \n\nI chose ""crash"" for the next guess because:\n- It maintains the confirmed starting letters ""CRA"".\n- It tests two new common consonants (S and H) in positions 4 and 5.\n- It avoids letters previously ruled out (N, E, F, T).\n- Using distinct letters (S and H) as opposed to duplicates maximizes potential feedback clarity.\n\n<guess>crash</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: crash -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

""craft"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x)\n   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and F and T are not in the word.\n\n3. ""crash"": C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x)\n   - Confirms ""CRA"" at the start, and S and H are not in the word.\n\nSo, the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and the missing two letters are not any of: N, E, F, T, S, H.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that does not contain the forbidden letters: N, E, F, T, S, H.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters for the last two positions. The available letters are from the alphabet excluding:\n- C, R, A (which are already in the word, but note: they might appear again? However, we haven\'t been told they can\'t, but we have to consider the feedback: the feedback for the first three are correct, but we don\'t know about duplicates. However, the feedback for the last two in ""crash"" said S and H are absent, so they are not in the word at all, even as duplicates? The feedback marks a letter as absent (x) if it is not in the word at all. So if the word had an S, but we guessed it in the wrong position, it would be marked with a dash (-). But in ""crash"", the S and H are marked as (x), meaning they are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word does not contain: N, E, F, T, S, H.\n\nAlso, we know the first three letters are C, R, A, so the word is ""C R A X Y"", where X and Y are letters not in {N, E, F, T, S, H}.\n\nNow, what are the possible words?\n\nCommon words that start with ""CRA"" and are 5 letters:\n\n- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed? M and P are not in the forbidden list.\n- craw: but ""craw"" is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n- crawl: but that\'s 5 letters? C R A W L -> but we have W and L? Are they forbidden? No, W and L are not in the forbidden list. But wait, ""crawl"" has 5 letters: C-R-A-W-L? Yes.\n- craze: but E is forbidden? Yes, so no.\n- craal: C R A A L -> A is already in the word? But we are allowed duplicates? However, the feedback hasn\'t indicated that A is duplicated? But it\'s possible. And A is not forbidden? But we have to check: the forbidden letters are N,E,F,T,S,H. A is not in that list. So ""craal"" is a possibility? But is it a common word? It\'s a South African word for an enclosure, but might be accepted.\n- crabs: but S is forbidden? So no, because of S.\n- crass: S is forbidden? So no.\n- craws: S is forbidden? So no.\n- craps: S is forbidden? So no.\n\nSo what about:\n- cramp: C R A M P -> M and P are allowed.\n- crawl: C R A W L -> W and L are allowed.\n- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden.\n- ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But ""crazy"" is 5 letters? C R A Z Y. Z and Y are not forbidden? But we haven\'t tested Z and Y? And the word is ""crazy"". But note: ""crazy"" has Z and Y? But we are missing the fourth and fifth? So ""crazy"" is a candidate? But let\'s check: C R A Z Y -> Z and Y.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might be less common? However, in Wordle, the word list is curated.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""crack"": C R A C K -> C and K. But note: we have a duplicate C? The first letter is C, and the fourth is C? Is that allowed? The feedback for ""crack"" as a guess: we haven\'t tried it. But the secret word might have duplicate C? However, we know the secret word has at least one C (at the beginning). If we guess ""crack"", and the secret word has only one C, then the fourth C would be marked as absent? Or would it be marked as present but wrong position? \n\nBut note: the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets a dash. If it is not in the word at all, it gets an x. But if the secret word has only one C (at the beginning), then when we guess a C in the fourth position, that C is not in the word (because the only C is already used at the first position) so it should be marked as x? \n\nBut in our case, we are not guessing ""crack"" yet. We are considering it as a candidate for the secret word. So if the secret word is ""crack"", then it has two C\'s? Then when we guessed ""crane"", we had one C (at the beginning) and it was marked correct. The other C in ""crack"" (at the fourth) was not guessed in ""crane"", so we didn\'t get feedback for it. Similarly, in ""craft"" and ""crash"", we didn\'t guess a C in the fourth? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut for now, ""crack"" is a candidate? Because it has C, R, A in the first three? And the last two are C and K? And C and K are not in the forbidden list? But wait, the forbidden list is N,E,F,T,S,H. C is not forbidden? But we already have a C? So duplicate C is allowed? And K is not forbidden? So ""crack"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""cramp"", ""crawl"", ""crazy"", ""craal"", and also ""crapy"" (if accepted? meaning resembling crape? but might be offensive? or ""crape"" is 5? no, crape is 5: C R A P E? but E is forbidden? so no).\n\nSo possible words:\n1. cramp: C R A M P\n2. crawl: C R A W L\n3. crack: C R A C K\n4. crazy: C R A Z Y\n5. craal: C R A A L\n\nWe need to choose one to guess. We want to maximize information? But we have only two positions to figure out, and we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we have 3 more guesses? Because we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6, we used 3, so 3 left.\n\nBut we can try to cover more letters? However, we are constrained by the fixed ""CRA"".\n\nWe can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common? For example, ""cramp"" uses M and P? ""crawl"" uses W and L? ""crazy"" uses Z and Y? ""crack"" uses C and K? ""craal"" uses A and L? But A is already known? So we might not get new information about other letters.\n\nSo let\'s avoid ""craal"" because it reuses A? We don\'t know if A is duplicated? But we are testing the fourth position? But we already know A is in the third? So if we get a check for A in the fourth? Then we know it\'s duplicated? But we are not sure? However, we want to test letters we haven\'t tried? So we can try ""cramp"" or ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested M, P, W, L, Z, Y, C (in fourth), K.\n\nBut we have already tested C? But only in the first position? We haven\'t tested C in the fourth? So it\'s a new position? But we know the word has at least one C? So if we put C in the fourth? And if it\'s not there? We get an x? Then we know there is no duplicate C? If we get a dash? Then it would mean the C is in the word but not in the fourth? But the only other position is the fifth? Or if the word has more than two C\'s? But unlikely.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid ""crack"" for now? Because it has a duplicate C? And we don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nSimilarly, ""craal"" has duplicate A? So we avoid that too.\n\nSo we are left with:\n- cramp: M and P\n- crawl: W and L\n- crazy: Z and Y\n\nWhich one to choose? We can choose ""cramp"" because M and P are more common than W, L, Z, Y? Or ""crawl"" because W and L are also common? \n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be one of these? So we can guess one of them.\n\nI think ""cramp"" is a good choice? Because M and P are common? And if it\'s not, we get feedback on M and P? Then we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possible words? But we don\'t have many words left? Only a few.\n\nLet me list the possible words again without duplicates? We have:\n\n- cramp\n- crawl\n- crazy\n- crack (if we consider it, but duplicate C)\n- craal (duplicate A)\n\nBut we can also have:\n- ""crawb""? not a word.\n- ""crawd""? not a word.\n- ""crawp""? not a word.\n\nSo the main ones are cramp, crawl, crazy, and maybe crack and craal.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? But we are avoiding craal? And M and P only in cramp? W only in crawl? Z and Y only in crazy? So no overlap? Then we have to pick one.\n\nI think we should pick ""cramp"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""cramp"".\n\nIf the feedback is:\n   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(?), P(?)\n\nIf M is correct and P is correct? Then we win.\n\nIf M is correct and P is wrong? Then we know the fourth letter is M? And the fifth is not P? And we can try other letters for fifth? But we know the fifth is not N,E,F,T,S,H? And not P? So we try L, W, Z, Y, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if M is wrong? Then we get x for M? Then we know M is not in the word? Then we can eliminate ""cramp"" and consider the others.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""cramp"".After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → The secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N or E.\n- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates F and T.\n- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Confirms ""CRA"" and eliminates S and H.\n\nThe secret word is **C R A _ _** , with the last two letters being unknown. The eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H**. Possible letters for positions 4 and 5 include common consonants like M, P, W, L, Z, Y, K, or vowels like O, U, I (but note the word must be valid and start with ""CRA"").\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""CRA"" and avoiding the eliminated letters.\n- Common candidates include: \n  - **cramp** (tests M and P)\n  - **crawl** (tests W and L)\n  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)\n  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K, but duplicate letters add complexity).\n- I chose **""cramp""** for this guess because:\n  - It tests two new, common consonants (M and P) not yet attempted.\n  - It avoids eliminated letters and reusing known letters (like A) in untested positions.\n  - If incorrect, the feedback will clearly indicate whether M or P are present and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if M is correct, we focus on position 5; if both are wrong, we eliminate M and P).\n\n<guess>cramp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: craft -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) F(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: crash -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) S(x) H(x)\nGuess 4: cramp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from four guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → Secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N, E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Contains no F, T.
3. crash: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Contains no S, H.
4. cramp: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(x), P(x) → Contains no M, P.

So the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and it does not contain any of the following letters: N, E, F, T, S, H, M, P.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that avoids these forbidden letters: N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus forbidden and the known C,R,A (but note the word might have duplicates? However, the feedback marks letters as absent (x) if they are not in the word at all, so duplicates are possible only if the letter is not in the forbidden list).

But the forbidden list is: N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P. So available letters: A,B,D,G,I,J,K,L,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But A is already in the word? So duplicates of A are possible? Yes.

But we must form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- crawl: C R A W L → W and L are allowed? W and L are not forbidden. So ""crawl"" is a candidate.
- crazy: C R A Z Y → Z and Y are allowed? Yes.
- crack: C R A C K → C and K? But C is allowed? We know the word has at least one C, so duplicate C is possible? And K is allowed? But ""crack"" has duplicate C? The secret word might be ""crack"".
- craal: C R A A L → A and L? Duplicate A? Possible.
- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden? Yes, so no.
- ""crane"" has N,E? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""craft"" has F,T? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crabs"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crass"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crams"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""craws"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.

So the main possibilities are: crawl, crazy, crack, craal.

We have two guesses left? Because we started with 6, we have used 4, so 2 left.

We can try one of them? Which one?

Let me think: we can try ""crawl"" first? Then if it's wrong, we get feedback.

But note: we know the word is one of crawl, crazy, crack, craal.

We can choose a word that tests letters that appear in multiple options? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? Z and Y only in crazy? C and K in crack? W in crawl? A in craal? 

But if we guess ""crawl"", it tests W and L? If both are correct? We win. If W is wrong? We get M(x) for W? Wait no: for position 4 and 5? We put W in fourth and L in fifth? 

Actually, if we guess ""crawl"", the feedback:

- Fourth letter (W): if correct, ✓? But what if W is not correct? Either absent? Or present in wrong position? Since the word must be C R A X Y, if W is not in fourth? Then the only other position is fifth? But we have L in fifth? So if W is marked with a dash? That would mean W is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? But we put L in fifth? So if fifth is W? Then L would be marked as absent? Or wrong?

Example: let's say the secret word is ""craal"": 
   C R A A L? And we guess ""crawl"": 
      Position1: C✓, R✓, A✓
      Position4: we guess W, but secret has A? So W is absent? Then W(x)? 
      Position5: we guess L? Secret has L? And position? The fifth? So L in fifth? Then L(✓)? 
   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know the fifth letter is L? And the fourth letter is not W? Then we can try craal? Or other words.

But we have only two guesses? And after ""crawl"" if we get W(x) and L(✓), then we know the word is C R A _ L? And the fourth letter is not W? But we know it is one of B,D,G,I,J,K,O,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z? Or A? Because A is allowed? Duplicate? So the fourth letter could be A? Or another letter? Then we would have to guess from words like ""craal"" (if fourth letter A) or ""crail"" (if I) or ""craul"" (not word)? Etc.

But we have the list of candidates: craal has A and L, so fifth is L? And fourth is A? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""crazy"", and we guess ""crawl"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), W: absent? W(x)? L: absent? L(x)? Because secret has Z and Y? So no W or L? Then feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(x)

Then we know the word is not crawl? And we have crazy, crack, craal left? But craal has L at fifth? And we got L(x) for ""crawl""? That would indicate L is not in the word? Since we got L(x) for fifth? So if L is absent? Then ""craal"" is eliminated? Because ""craal"" has L? So we get: 
   For ""crawl"" guess: if secret is ""crazy"", then L(x) means L is not in the word? Then ""craal"" and ""crawl"" are ruled out? Then only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? Because ""craal"" has L? So it would be eliminated? Because L must be absent.

Similarly, for ""crack"": it has no L? So if we get L(x) and W(x), then we know the word is either ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

Then our next guess can be ""crazy"" or ""crack"". We can choose one? 

Alternatively, to save guesses? We can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have only two guesses? So if we guess ""crawl"" and it's wrong? Then we have one guess left? And we might have multiple possibilities? So we need to cover as many as possible? Or we could guess ""crack"" first? 

But let's list the words and their letters:

- crawl: letters C,R,A,W,L
- crazy: C,R,A,Z,Y
- crack: C,R,A,C,K → contains C twice? So letters: C,R,A,K
- craal: C,R,A,A,L → letters: C,R,A,L

We note that:
- If the secret word is ""craal"", it contains A and L? Duplicates? A twice? And L once.
- If the secret is ""crack"", it contains C twice? And K.
- If the secret is ""crazy"", it contains Z and Y.

We want a word to test? But we are constrained to start with CRA? So we have to use a word in the same pattern? 

Another idea: we can try ""crazy"" as a guess? Then if it's correct? We win. If not? We get feedback.

Assume we guess ""crazy"":
   Secret is ""crawl"": then 
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z: absent → x? Y: absent → x? 
      Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) Z(x) Y(x)
   Then we know the word is not crazy? And not crawl (if missed)? But wait, how? 

Actually, we are guessing ""crazy"", and if the secret is ""crawl"", we get:
   Positions:
      1: C✓
      2: R✓
      3: A✓
      4: we guess Z, secret has W? So Z(x)
      5: we guess Y, secret has L? So Y(x)
   So we eliminate Z and Y? Then we know the word must have W and L? So we guess ""crawl"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""crack"" and we guess ""crazy"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z: absent? So x? Y: absent? So x?
   Feedback: same? Then we would know the word doesn't have Z or Y? But ""crack"" has duplicate C and K? So we would try ""crack"" next? 

But we cannot distinguish between ""crawl"" and ""crack"" from the feedback? Because both give C(✓)R(✓)A(✓)Z(x)Y(x)? So we don't know if it's ""crawl"" or ""crack""? And we have one guess left? We would have to risk one? 50% chance? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""crawl"" first? 

If we guess ""crawl"", and the secret is ""crazy"", we get:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), W: absent? x? L: absent? x?
   So same issue: we cannot distinguish ""crazy"" and ""crack""? 

But wait, if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(x) and L(x), then we know the word does not contain W or L? Then ""craal"" has L? So eliminated? And ""crawl"" has L? So eliminated? Only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? Then we can guess between them? 

Similarly, if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(x) and L(✓), then we know fifth letter is L? So we can guess ""craal"" for the next? 

But ""craal"" is a word? And we have to guess it? 

But let me consider: if we get L(✓) and W(x), then the word has L in fifth? And the fourth letter is not W? Then what could it be? It must be ""craal"" because only ""craal"" has L at the fifth? And the fourth is A? 

Similarly, if we get W(✓) and L(✓), then it is ""crawl"".

If we get W(✓) and L(x)? That would mean W is correct? And L absent? But then the word must be C R A W ? ? But what word starts with CRAW? Without S? ""craws"" has S? Forbidden? ""crawm""? No. ""crawd""? No. So there is no other common word? So if we get W(✓) and L(x), then we have no candidate? But we have ""crazy"" and ""crack"" which don't have W? So we know W is in fourth? Then we have to guess the fifth letter? But we don't have a candidate? 

Wait, our candidates are only crawl, crazy, crack, craal. None of crazy or crack or craal has W? So if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(✓) and L(x), then the secret word must be ""crawl"" with different fifth? But we guessed ""crawl""? So if it's not that? Then there is no candidate? That means we missed something? 

But in reality, if we get W(✓) and L(x), then the fourth letter is W? And the fifth is something else? But we need a word C R A W ? ? And we have no candidates? So we must have missed a word? 

What word starts with CRAW? Without S? We have ""craw"" is 4 letters? ""crawl"" is only 5? Then none? So actually, if we get W(✓) (meaning fourth is W) and L(x) (meaning L is not in the word), then we have a problem? Because the word would be C R A W X? but we don't know X? And it must avoid N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P? And we know no S,H,M,P? And L is now ruled out? But what is X? 

But in our candidate list, only ""crawl"" has W? And if L is absent? Then it cannot be ""crawl"". So there is no candidate? That means we must have missed a word? 

For example, ""crowd""? But starts with CRO, not CRA? Or ""crown""? Same? So no? 

Therefore, if we get W in fourth and L not present, it's a failure? But we must have covered all candidates? 

This means that the secret cannot be ""crawl"" if we get L(x) and W(✓)? So we are forced to assume that if W is correct, then L must be correct? I.e., ""crawl"" must be the word? 

But that's not necessarily true? So we need a better approach? 

Maybe we should guess ""crazy"" next? Because it contains Z and Y? Letters that are rare? And if we test for them? 

Let me choose ""crazy"" as the next guess? Then:

If the secret is ""crazy"", we win.
If the secret is ""crawl"", we get Z(x) and Y(x) → and we know the word has W and L? Then we guess ""crawl"" next.
If the secret is ""crack"", we get Z(x) and Y(x) → we know it must have K and possibly duplicate C? But we didn't guess C or K? So we have to figure? Then we guess ""c""4th position? We don't know? 

But with one guess left? After guessing ""crazy"" and getting Z(x) and Y(x), we don't know if the secret is ""crawl"" or ""crack""? Because both give the same feedback? So with our last guess, we must choose between ""crawl"" and ""crack""? 

But we have no information to distinguish? 

Alternatively, guess ""crack"" as the next guess? Then:

If the secret is ""crack"", we win.
If the secret is ""crazy"", we get: 
   Forth we put C? The secret is ""crazy"", which has C at 1? But fourth is Z? So we guess C in fourth? Secret has no C in fourth? Does it have C elsewhere? Only at the beginning? Then there is one C? So the fourth C we guess? Since there is only one C and it's at the beginning? And we already have a C there? So the fourth C is not in the word? Should get C(x)? 
   In standard Wordle, if you guess a letter that is in the word but already matched? Then if there is no second instance, it will be gray? 

Example: secret ""abcde"", guess ""aaccx"" → for the first A: ✓, then for the third A: since no more A? It gets x? 

Similarly here: secret ""crazy"" has only one C? So for ""crack"" guess:
   Positions:
      1: C → in secret? Same position? ✓
      2: R → ✓
      3: A → ✓
      4: C → not in secret's fourth? And secret has only one C? Which is at position 1? Already used? So this C should be x.
      5: K → secret has Y? Not K? So K is not in the word? x.
   Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x)

If the secret is ""crawl"", and we guess ""crack"", we get:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), C: we are guessing a second C? Secret ""crawl"" has only one C? So fourth C should be x? 
   K: absent? x?
   So same as above: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x)

Again, can't distinguish.

So the best is to guess ""crawl"" first? Because if we get W(x) and L(✓), we know the word has L at fifth? And it must be ""craal"" (since ""crawl"" has W which is x, so not crawl). Then we guess ""craal"" next.

If we get W(x) and L(x), then we know it must be ""crazy"" or ""crack"". Then for our last guess, we can try ""crazy"" and hope? Or ""crack"", 50% chance.

But we can also notice that ""craal"" has L at fifth? And if we guess ""crawl"", and get L(✓), then the fifth letter is L? Then the fourth letter? It must be A? Because ""craal"" is the only candidate with L at fifth? So we can deduce and guess ""craal"" next.

Similarly, if we get L(x) for ""crawl"", then the fifth letter is not L? But we know the word must be ""crazy"" or ""crack""? Both have the fifth letter not L? So no new knowledge? 

But let's formalize:

Guess: ""crawl"" (for guess 5)

Possible feedback:

Case 1: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(✓) → we solved it.

Case 2: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(✓) → meaning W is not in the word, but L is in the word and in fifth position? So the fifth letter is L? And the fourth letter is not W? And we know the word does not contain W? Then the only candidate with L at fifth and fourth not W is ""craal""? So we can then guess ""craal"" for guess 6.

Case 3: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(x) → meaning W is in fourth? And L is not in the word? Then the fifth letter is ? But no candidate has W at fourth? So this is impossible? Or we missed a word? For example, ""crawp""? Not a word? So this case should not happen? Therefore, we rule it out? Or we must have made a mistake.

Since we have no candidate with fourth letter W and not L? There is no such word? Therefore, if we get W(✓) and L(x), the secret cannot be in our list? So we lose? But our list should be complete? 

Upon second thought, is there a word like ""crawd""? No? ""crews"" has E and S? Forbidden? So in practice, if we get W(✓) and L(x), we might have to guess words like ""crawb""? But not a word? 

That's painful? So to avoid this, perhaps we should not bet on ""crawl"" with W(✓) and L(x) being possible? 

Case 4: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(x) → then the word does not contain W or L? Then we know it must be ""crazy"" or ""crack"" or ""craal"" has L? But L(x) means L not in the word? So ""craal"" is eliminated? Because it has L? Then only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? And we don't know which? So we have one guess left? We can try ""crazy"" or ""crack"", say ""crazy"" is better? Because Z and Y are rare? 

But it's a gamble? 

So the best strategy is to guess the most common word among the candidates? Or we can prepare by noticing that ""craal"" is the least common? So we can eliminate it? Or assume the word is ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

Given that, I think ""crawl"" is a relatively common word? So we try it? If it fails? We get feedback? Then we see.

Actually, since we have no way to distinguish without more information, I'll guess ""crawl"" now.

So guess: crawl

If we are lucky, it's correct? Otherwise, we use the last guess.
</think>
After analyzing the cumulative feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓) confirm the word starts with ""CRA""; N and E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: F and T are absent (x), eliminating more letters.
- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: S and H are absent (x).
- **Guess 4 (""cramp"")**: M and P are absent (x).

The secret word is **C R A _ _**, with the first three letters fixed. Eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H, M, P**. The only possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are from the remaining alphabet: **B, D, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**. Duplicate letters (like repeated A, C, R) are possible since the feedback marks absolute absence (x).

### Key Insights:
- Valid candidates must be 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"" and excluding all eliminated letters. Common options are:
  - **crawl** (tests W and L)
  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)
  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K)
  - **craal** (tests duplicate A and L).
- I chose **""crawl""** for this guess because:
  - It tests two new, unprobed letters (W and L), which are common consonants.
  - It avoids eliminated letters and minimizes overlap with existing fixed letters.
  - Feedback will clarify:
    - If **W(✓) and L(✓)**, the word is ""crawl"".
    - If **W(x) and L(✓)**, the fifth letter is L, pointing to ""craal"" (guessed next).
    - If **W(x) and L(x)**, we eliminate W and L, leaving ""crazy"" or ""crack"" for the final guess.
    - The case W(✓) and L(x) is improbable, as no valid candidate has W in position 4 without L (e.g., ""craws"" contains S, which is eliminated).

With 2 guesses left, this maximizes information by testing a high-frequency word and reducing uncertainty for the final guess.

<guess>crawl</guess>",crawl,"We are given the feedback from four guesses:
1. crane: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(x) → Secret word starts with ""CRA"" and contains no N, E.
2. craft: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), F(x), T(x) → Contains no F, T.
3. crash: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), S(x), H(x) → Contains no S, H.
4. cramp: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), M(x), P(x) → Contains no M, P.

So the secret word is ""C R A _ _"", and it does not contain any of the following letters: N, E, F, T, S, H, M, P.

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""CRA"" that avoids these forbidden letters: N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P.

What letters are left? The alphabet minus forbidden and the known C,R,A (but note the word might have duplicates? However, the feedback marks letters as absent (x) if they are not in the word at all, so duplicates are possible only if the letter is not in the forbidden list).

But the forbidden list is: N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P. So available letters: A,B,D,G,I,J,K,L,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But A is already in the word? So duplicates of A are possible? Yes.

But we must form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- crawl: C R A W L → W and L are allowed? W and L are not forbidden. So ""crawl"" is a candidate.
- crazy: C R A Z Y → Z and Y are allowed? Yes.
- crack: C R A C K → C and K? But C is allowed? We know the word has at least one C, so duplicate C is possible? And K is allowed? But ""crack"" has duplicate C? The secret word might be ""crack"".
- craal: C R A A L → A and L? Duplicate A? Possible.
- Also, ""crave"" has E? Forbidden? Yes, so no.
- ""crane"" has N,E? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""craft"" has F,T? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crabs"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crass"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""crams"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.
- ""craws"" has S? Forbidden? Yes.

So the main possibilities are: crawl, crazy, crack, craal.

We have two guesses left? Because we started with 6, we have used 4, so 2 left.

We can try one of them? Which one?

Let me think: we can try ""crawl"" first? Then if it's wrong, we get feedback.

But note: we know the word is one of crawl, crazy, crack, craal.

We can choose a word that tests letters that appear in multiple options? For example, L appears in crawl and craal? Z and Y only in crazy? C and K in crack? W in crawl? A in craal? 

But if we guess ""crawl"", it tests W and L? If both are correct? We win. If W is wrong? We get M(x) for W? Wait no: for position 4 and 5? We put W in fourth and L in fifth? 

Actually, if we guess ""crawl"", the feedback:

- Fourth letter (W): if correct, ✓? But what if W is not correct? Either absent? Or present in wrong position? Since the word must be C R A X Y, if W is not in fourth? Then the only other position is fifth? But we have L in fifth? So if W is marked with a dash? That would mean W is in the word but not in fourth? Then it must be in fifth? But we put L in fifth? So if fifth is W? Then L would be marked as absent? Or wrong?

Example: let's say the secret word is ""craal"": 
   C R A A L? And we guess ""crawl"": 
      Position1: C✓, R✓, A✓
      Position4: we guess W, but secret has A? So W is absent? Then W(x)? 
      Position5: we guess L? Secret has L? And position? The fifth? So L in fifth? Then L(✓)? 
   So feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(✓)

Then we know the fifth letter is L? And the fourth letter is not W? Then we can try craal? Or other words.

But we have only two guesses? And after ""crawl"" if we get W(x) and L(✓), then we know the word is C R A _ L? And the fourth letter is not W? But we know it is one of B,D,G,I,J,K,O,Q,U,V,X,Y,Z? Or A? Because A is allowed? Duplicate? So the fourth letter could be A? Or another letter? Then we would have to guess from words like ""craal"" (if fourth letter A) or ""crail"" (if I) or ""craul"" (not word)? Etc.

But we have the list of candidates: craal has A and L, so fifth is L? And fourth is A? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""crazy"", and we guess ""crawl"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), W: absent? W(x)? L: absent? L(x)? Because secret has Z and Y? So no W or L? Then feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(x)

Then we know the word is not crawl? And we have crazy, crack, craal left? But craal has L at fifth? And we got L(x) for ""crawl""? That would indicate L is not in the word? Since we got L(x) for fifth? So if L is absent? Then ""craal"" is eliminated? Because ""craal"" has L? So we get: 
   For ""crawl"" guess: if secret is ""crazy"", then L(x) means L is not in the word? Then ""craal"" and ""crawl"" are ruled out? Then only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? Because ""craal"" has L? So it would be eliminated? Because L must be absent.

Similarly, for ""crack"": it has no L? So if we get L(x) and W(x), then we know the word is either ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

Then our next guess can be ""crazy"" or ""crack"". We can choose one? 

Alternatively, to save guesses? We can guess a word that distinguishes them? But we have only two guesses? So if we guess ""crawl"" and it's wrong? Then we have one guess left? And we might have multiple possibilities? So we need to cover as many as possible? Or we could guess ""crack"" first? 

But let's list the words and their letters:

- crawl: letters C,R,A,W,L
- crazy: C,R,A,Z,Y
- crack: C,R,A,C,K → contains C twice? So letters: C,R,A,K
- craal: C,R,A,A,L → letters: C,R,A,L

We note that:
- If the secret word is ""craal"", it contains A and L? Duplicates? A twice? And L once.
- If the secret is ""crack"", it contains C twice? And K.
- If the secret is ""crazy"", it contains Z and Y.

We want a word to test? But we are constrained to start with CRA? So we have to use a word in the same pattern? 

Another idea: we can try ""crazy"" as a guess? Then if it's correct? We win. If not? We get feedback.

Assume we guess ""crazy"":
   Secret is ""crawl"": then 
      C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z: absent → x? Y: absent → x? 
      Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) Z(x) Y(x)
   Then we know the word is not crazy? And not crawl (if missed)? But wait, how? 

Actually, we are guessing ""crazy"", and if the secret is ""crawl"", we get:
   Positions:
      1: C✓
      2: R✓
      3: A✓
      4: we guess Z, secret has W? So Z(x)
      5: we guess Y, secret has L? So Y(x)
   So we eliminate Z and Y? Then we know the word must have W and L? So we guess ""crawl"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""crack"" and we guess ""crazy"":
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z: absent? So x? Y: absent? So x?
   Feedback: same? Then we would know the word doesn't have Z or Y? But ""crack"" has duplicate C and K? So we would try ""crack"" next? 

But we cannot distinguish between ""crawl"" and ""crack"" from the feedback? Because both give C(✓)R(✓)A(✓)Z(x)Y(x)? So we don't know if it's ""crawl"" or ""crack""? And we have one guess left? We would have to risk one? 50% chance? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""crawl"" first? 

If we guess ""crawl"", and the secret is ""crazy"", we get:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), W: absent? x? L: absent? x?
   So same issue: we cannot distinguish ""crazy"" and ""crack""? 

But wait, if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(x) and L(x), then we know the word does not contain W or L? Then ""craal"" has L? So eliminated? And ""crawl"" has L? So eliminated? Only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? Then we can guess between them? 

Similarly, if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(x) and L(✓), then we know fifth letter is L? So we can guess ""craal"" for the next? 

But ""craal"" is a word? And we have to guess it? 

But let me consider: if we get L(✓) and W(x), then the word has L in fifth? And the fourth letter is not W? Then what could it be? It must be ""craal"" because only ""craal"" has L at the fifth? And the fourth is A? 

Similarly, if we get W(✓) and L(✓), then it is ""crawl"".

If we get W(✓) and L(x)? That would mean W is correct? And L absent? But then the word must be C R A W ? ? But what word starts with CRAW? Without S? ""craws"" has S? Forbidden? ""crawm""? No. ""crawd""? No. So there is no other common word? So if we get W(✓) and L(x), then we have no candidate? But we have ""crazy"" and ""crack"" which don't have W? So we know W is in fourth? Then we have to guess the fifth letter? But we don't have a candidate? 

Wait, our candidates are only crawl, crazy, crack, craal. None of crazy or crack or craal has W? So if we guess ""crawl"" and get W(✓) and L(x), then the secret word must be ""crawl"" with different fifth? But we guessed ""crawl""? So if it's not that? Then there is no candidate? That means we missed something? 

But in reality, if we get W(✓) and L(x), then the fourth letter is W? And the fifth is something else? But we need a word C R A W ? ? And we have no candidates? So we must have missed a word? 

What word starts with CRAW? Without S? We have ""craw"" is 4 letters? ""crawl"" is only 5? Then none? So actually, if we get W(✓) (meaning fourth is W) and L(x) (meaning L is not in the word), then we have a problem? Because the word would be C R A W X? but we don't know X? And it must avoid N,E,F,T,S,H,M,P? And we know no S,H,M,P? And L is now ruled out? But what is X? 

But in our candidate list, only ""crawl"" has W? And if L is absent? Then it cannot be ""crawl"". So there is no candidate? That means we must have missed a word? 

For example, ""crowd""? But starts with CRO, not CRA? Or ""crown""? Same? So no? 

Therefore, if we get W in fourth and L not present, it's a failure? But we must have covered all candidates? 

This means that the secret cannot be ""crawl"" if we get L(x) and W(✓)? So we are forced to assume that if W is correct, then L must be correct? I.e., ""crawl"" must be the word? 

But that's not necessarily true? So we need a better approach? 

Maybe we should guess ""crazy"" next? Because it contains Z and Y? Letters that are rare? And if we test for them? 

Let me choose ""crazy"" as the next guess? Then:

If the secret is ""crazy"", we win.
If the secret is ""crawl"", we get Z(x) and Y(x) → and we know the word has W and L? Then we guess ""crawl"" next.
If the secret is ""crack"", we get Z(x) and Y(x) → we know it must have K and possibly duplicate C? But we didn't guess C or K? So we have to figure? Then we guess ""c""4th position? We don't know? 

But with one guess left? After guessing ""crazy"" and getting Z(x) and Y(x), we don't know if the secret is ""crawl"" or ""crack""? Because both give the same feedback? So with our last guess, we must choose between ""crawl"" and ""crack""? 

But we have no information to distinguish? 

Alternatively, guess ""crack"" as the next guess? Then:

If the secret is ""crack"", we win.
If the secret is ""crazy"", we get: 
   Forth we put C? The secret is ""crazy"", which has C at 1? But fourth is Z? So we guess C in fourth? Secret has no C in fourth? Does it have C elsewhere? Only at the beginning? Then there is one C? So the fourth C we guess? Since there is only one C and it's at the beginning? And we already have a C there? So the fourth C is not in the word? Should get C(x)? 
   In standard Wordle, if you guess a letter that is in the word but already matched? Then if there is no second instance, it will be gray? 

Example: secret ""abcde"", guess ""aaccx"" → for the first A: ✓, then for the third A: since no more A? It gets x? 

Similarly here: secret ""crazy"" has only one C? So for ""crack"" guess:
   Positions:
      1: C → in secret? Same position? ✓
      2: R → ✓
      3: A → ✓
      4: C → not in secret's fourth? And secret has only one C? Which is at position 1? Already used? So this C should be x.
      5: K → secret has Y? Not K? So K is not in the word? x.
   Feedback: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x)

If the secret is ""crawl"", and we guess ""crack"", we get:
   C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), C: we are guessing a second C? Secret ""crawl"" has only one C? So fourth C should be x? 
   K: absent? x?
   So same as above: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(x) K(x)

Again, can't distinguish.

So the best is to guess ""crawl"" first? Because if we get W(x) and L(✓), we know the word has L at fifth? And it must be ""craal"" (since ""crawl"" has W which is x, so not crawl). Then we guess ""craal"" next.

If we get W(x) and L(x), then we know it must be ""crazy"" or ""crack"". Then for our last guess, we can try ""crazy"" and hope? Or ""crack"", 50% chance.

But we can also notice that ""craal"" has L at fifth? And if we guess ""crawl"", and get L(✓), then the fifth letter is L? Then the fourth letter? It must be A? Because ""craal"" is the only candidate with L at fifth? So we can deduce and guess ""craal"" next.

Similarly, if we get L(x) for ""crawl"", then the fifth letter is not L? But we know the word must be ""crazy"" or ""crack""? Both have the fifth letter not L? So no new knowledge? 

But let's formalize:

Guess: ""crawl"" (for guess 5)

Possible feedback:

Case 1: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(✓) → we solved it.

Case 2: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(✓) → meaning W is not in the word, but L is in the word and in fifth position? So the fifth letter is L? And the fourth letter is not W? And we know the word does not contain W? Then the only candidate with L at fifth and fourth not W is ""craal""? So we can then guess ""craal"" for guess 6.

Case 3: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(x) → meaning W is in fourth? And L is not in the word? Then the fifth letter is ? But no candidate has W at fourth? So this is impossible? Or we missed a word? For example, ""crawp""? Not a word? So this case should not happen? Therefore, we rule it out? Or we must have made a mistake.

Since we have no candidate with fourth letter W and not L? There is no such word? Therefore, if we get W(✓) and L(x), the secret cannot be in our list? So we lose? But our list should be complete? 

Upon second thought, is there a word like ""crawd""? No? ""crews"" has E and S? Forbidden? So in practice, if we get W(✓) and L(x), we might have to guess words like ""crawb""? But not a word? 

That's painful? So to avoid this, perhaps we should not bet on ""crawl"" with W(✓) and L(x) being possible? 

Case 4: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x) L(x) → then the word does not contain W or L? Then we know it must be ""crazy"" or ""crack"" or ""craal"" has L? But L(x) means L not in the word? So ""craal"" is eliminated? Because it has L? Then only ""crazy"" and ""crack"" left? And we don't know which? So we have one guess left? We can try ""crazy"" or ""crack"", say ""crazy"" is better? Because Z and Y are rare? 

But it's a gamble? 

So the best strategy is to guess the most common word among the candidates? Or we can prepare by noticing that ""craal"" is the least common? So we can eliminate it? Or assume the word is ""crawl"" or ""crazy"" or ""crack"".

Given that, I think ""crawl"" is a relatively common word? So we try it? If it fails? We get feedback? Then we see.

Actually, since we have no way to distinguish without more information, I'll guess ""crawl"" now.

So guess: crawl

If we are lucky, it's correct? Otherwise, we use the last guess.After analyzing the cumulative feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(✓) confirm the word starts with ""CRA""; N and E are absent (x).
- **Guess 2 (""craft"")**: F and T are absent (x), eliminating more letters.
- **Guess 3 (""crash"")**: S and H are absent (x).
- **Guess 4 (""cramp"")**: M and P are absent (x).

The secret word is **C R A _ _**, with the first three letters fixed. Eliminated letters (absent from the word) are: **N, E, F, T, S, H, M, P**. The only possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are from the remaining alphabet: **B, D, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**. Duplicate letters (like repeated A, C, R) are possible since the feedback marks absolute absence (x).

### Key Insights:
- Valid candidates must be 5-letter words starting with ""CRA"" and excluding all eliminated letters. Common options are:
  - **crawl** (tests W and L)
  - **crazy** (tests Z and Y)
  - **crack** (tests duplicate C and K)
  - **craal** (tests duplicate A and L).
- I chose **""crawl""** for this guess because:
  - It tests two new, unprobed letters (W and L), which are common consonants.
  - It avoids eliminated letters and minimizes overlap with existing fixed letters.
  - Feedback will clarify:
    - If **W(✓) and L(✓)**, the word is ""crawl"".
    - If **W(x) and L(✓)**, the fifth letter is L, pointing to ""craal"" (guessed next).
    - If **W(x) and L(x)**, we eliminate W and L, leaving ""crazy"" or ""crack"" for the final guess.
    - The case W(✓) and L(x) is improbable, as no valid candidate has W in position 4 without L (e.g., ""craws"" contains S, which is eliminated).

With 2 guesses left, this maximizes information by testing a high-frequency word and reducing uncertainty for the final guess.",Guess 5: crawl -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
