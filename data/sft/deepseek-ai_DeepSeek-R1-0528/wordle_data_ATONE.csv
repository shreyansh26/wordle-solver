We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: ✓ (correct position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'A' but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position in ""crane"").
 - The letter 'N' is in the 4th position and the letter 'E' is in the 5th position.
 - The letters 'C' and 'R' are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N E

 Also, the word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4th: N, 5th: E), we can try to find a word that fits.

 We must avoid using 'C' and 'R' because they are not in the word.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and have an 'A' somewhere (but not in the 3rd position).

 The positions for 'A' can be 1st or 2nd (since 3rd is excluded and 4th and 5th are fixed as N and E).

 We also have to consider that we have two unknown letters (positions 1, 2, and 3) but note that the 3rd position is the one before N.

 However, we have only two positions left for the 'A' and the other two letters (since we have three positions: 1,2,3 but one of them must be 'A' and the others are unknown).

 But note: the feedback for 'A' was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So it must be in position 1 or 2.

 We also don't know what the other two letters are (for positions 1, 2, and 3) except that they cannot be 'C' or 'R'.

 Let's try to think of words ending with ""NE"" that have an 'A' in the first or second position.

 Some possibilities:

 - If 'A' is in the 1st position: A _ _ N E
   Examples: ""axone"", ""amine"", ""alone"", ""atone"", ""agone"", etc.

 - If 'A' is in the 2nd position: _ A _ N E
   Examples: ""mane"", but ""mane"" is 4 letters -> we need 5 letters. So: ""plane"", ""crane"" (but we already tried crane and it had A in the 3rd? Actually in ""crane"", A was in the 3rd position? Let me check: 
     crane: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). So we know A is not in 3rd, so we cannot use words with A in 3rd.

 But note: in our feedback, we have A as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So in the new word, we must have A in either 1st or 2nd.

 However, we already tried ""crane"" and it had A in the 3rd, which is why we got a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning that in the secret word, A is present but not in the 3rd position. So in the secret word, A is not in the 3rd position.

 Therefore, we can try words with A in the 1st or 2nd.

 Let's consider the constraints:

 - The word must have the letters: A (in position 1 or 2), N (in position 4), E (in position 5).
 - The word must not contain C or R.

 We also have two more letters to fill in positions 2 and 3 (if A is in 1) or positions 1 and 3 (if A is in 2).

 We have 6 tries, so we can try a word that tests common letters.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4 and 5) and one known letter (A) that must be in position 1 or 2, we can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position to test that.

 But note: we also have to avoid using the letters that we know are not in the word (C and R).

 Let me list some words:

 Option 1: A in the first position: A _ _ N E
   We need two letters for positions 2 and 3. They can be any letters except C and R.

   Examples: 
     ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> but we don't know if L and O are in the word.
     ""atone"": A, T, O, N, E
     ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E
     ""agone"": A, G, O, N, E

 Option 2: A in the second position: _ A _ N E
   Examples:
     ""plane"": P, L, A, N, E -> but we have A in the 3rd? Actually, in ""plane"": 
        position1: P, position2: L, position3: A -> but wait, that would put A in the 3rd? 
        Actually, no: the word ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> so A is in the 3rd position? 
        But we are looking for A in the second? 

     Actually, if we put A in the second position, the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""mane"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

     How about: ""banes"" -> but that ends with S, not E? We need to end with NE.

     Actually, we need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""sane"" is 4 letters. 
        ""wane"" is 4 letters.

     We need 5 letters. So we must have a 5-letter word. 

     How about: ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> that's 5 letters, but A is in the 3rd position? 
        Position1: P, Position2: L, Position3: A -> so A is in the 3rd.

     We need A in the second position? Then the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""jaune"" (not common) or ""gaunt"" doesn't end with E. 

     Actually, it's hard to find 5-letter words ending with ""NE"" that have A in the second position.

     Let me check: 
        ""bane"" is 4, so we can't use that. 
        ""cane"" is 4, and also has C which we know is not in the word.

     How about: ""dance""? But that ends with CE, not NE.

     We need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""mane"" is 4, so we need to add a letter? Actually, we can't. 

     Alternatively, we can consider that the word might have the same letter repeated? But we don't have any indication of that.

     After thinking, it's more common to have A in the first position for words ending with NE.

     So let's focus on A in the first position.

 We have two unknown letters (positions 2 and 3). We can try to use a word that has common consonants in positions 2 and 3.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover common letters.

 We know that the word has at least the letters: A, N, E.

 We don't know the other two letters. They can be any letter except C and R.

 Let's try a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, L, S, etc.

 We can try ""atone"": 
   A in 1st, T in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, E in 5th.

 But note: we already know that N and E are in the correct positions, so we are testing the first three.

 Alternatively, we can try ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E.

 However, we have to consider that we might have the letter 'A' in the second position? But we don't have a good candidate for that.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in the first position but tests the second position? But we don't have a candidate.

 Another idea: we can try a word that has A in the second position and also tests other common letters? But we don't have a word ending with NE and A in the second.

 Let me double-check: are there any 5-letter words ending with ""NE"" that have A in the second position?

 I can think of: 
   ""plane"" -> but that has A in the third? 
   ""shane"" -> S H A N E -> A is in the third? 
   ""crane"" -> we tried and A was in the third.

 Actually, in the word ""crane"", A was in the third. So we need a word that has A in the second? 

 How about: ""bakes"" -> doesn't end with NE.

 It seems difficult. Maybe we should consider that the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any feedback about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we might have misjudged: the feedback for ""crane"" was for the entire word. The secret word has an 'A' but not in the third position. So if we try a word that has A in the first or second, we might get a ✓ for A if it is in the correct position.

 Since we don't have a candidate for A in the second, let's try A in the first.

 We'll try ""atone"": 
   A in 1st, T in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, E in 5th.

 Why ""atone""? 
   - It uses common letters T and O.
   - We avoid C and R.

 But note: we don't know if the word has T or O. This guess will help us find out.

 Alternatively, we can try ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> which tests L and O.

 Or ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E -> tests M and I.

 Which one is better? We want to maximize information.

 Since we have two unknown letters, we can choose a word that has two new common letters.

 Let's choose ""alone"": because L and O are common.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and R are excluded. So L and O are safe.

 So I will go with ""alone"".

 However, we must note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has an 'A' but not in the 3rd position. In ""alone"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the secret word has A in the 1st, then we get a ✓ for A. If the secret word has A in the 2nd, then we get a '-' for A (because it's present but not in the 1st). So this guess will help us determine the position of A.

 Also, we are testing L and O.

 Therefore, let's guess ""alone"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has A in the second position? Then in ""alone"", the A is in the first, so we would get a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position? Then we would know that A must be in the second position.

 So ""alone"" is a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the second position? But we don't have a candidate. So let's stick with ""alone"".

 But note: we must avoid using the same letters that we already know are not in the word (C and R). ""alone"" does not contain C or R.

 So I choose ""alone"".

<guess>alone</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- ""A"" is in the word but not in the 3rd position (marked ""-"").
- ""N"" is correct and in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").
- ""E"" is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the following constraints:
- Format: `_ _ _ N E`
- Contains ""A"" in either the 1st or 2nd position (since it cannot be in the 3rd).
- Excludes ""C"" and ""R"".

For the next guess, I chose **""alone""** because:
- It places ""A"" in the 1st position to test if ""A"" belongs there (if not, it must be in the 2nd position).
- It introduces new common letters ""L"" and ""O"" to gather more information.
- It adheres to the known constraints (ends with ""NE"", avoids ""C"" and ""R"").

<guess>alone</guess>",alone,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: ✓ (correct position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'A' but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position in ""crane"").
 - The letter 'N' is in the 4th position and the letter 'E' is in the 5th position.
 - The letters 'C' and 'R' are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N E

 Also, the word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4th: N, 5th: E), we can try to find a word that fits.

 We must avoid using 'C' and 'R' because they are not in the word.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and have an 'A' somewhere (but not in the 3rd position).

 The positions for 'A' can be 1st or 2nd (since 3rd is excluded and 4th and 5th are fixed as N and E).

 We also have to consider that we have two unknown letters (positions 1, 2, and 3) but note that the 3rd position is the one before N.

 However, we have only two positions left for the 'A' and the other two letters (since we have three positions: 1,2,3 but one of them must be 'A' and the others are unknown).

 But note: the feedback for 'A' was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So it must be in position 1 or 2.

 We also don't know what the other two letters are (for positions 1, 2, and 3) except that they cannot be 'C' or 'R'.

 Let's try to think of words ending with ""NE"" that have an 'A' in the first or second position.

 Some possibilities:

 - If 'A' is in the 1st position: A _ _ N E
   Examples: ""axone"", ""amine"", ""alone"", ""atone"", ""agone"", etc.

 - If 'A' is in the 2nd position: _ A _ N E
   Examples: ""mane"", but ""mane"" is 4 letters -> we need 5 letters. So: ""plane"", ""crane"" (but we already tried crane and it had A in the 3rd? Actually in ""crane"", A was in the 3rd position? Let me check: 
     crane: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). So we know A is not in 3rd, so we cannot use words with A in 3rd.

 But note: in our feedback, we have A as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So in the new word, we must have A in either 1st or 2nd.

 However, we already tried ""crane"" and it had A in the 3rd, which is why we got a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning that in the secret word, A is present but not in the 3rd position. So in the secret word, A is not in the 3rd position.

 Therefore, we can try words with A in the 1st or 2nd.

 Let's consider the constraints:

 - The word must have the letters: A (in position 1 or 2), N (in position 4), E (in position 5).
 - The word must not contain C or R.

 We also have two more letters to fill in positions 2 and 3 (if A is in 1) or positions 1 and 3 (if A is in 2).

 We have 6 tries, so we can try a word that tests common letters.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4 and 5) and one known letter (A) that must be in position 1 or 2, we can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position to test that.

 But note: we also have to avoid using the letters that we know are not in the word (C and R).

 Let me list some words:

 Option 1: A in the first position: A _ _ N E
   We need two letters for positions 2 and 3. They can be any letters except C and R.

   Examples: 
     ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> but we don't know if L and O are in the word.
     ""atone"": A, T, O, N, E
     ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E
     ""agone"": A, G, O, N, E

 Option 2: A in the second position: _ A _ N E
   Examples:
     ""plane"": P, L, A, N, E -> but we have A in the 3rd? Actually, in ""plane"": 
        position1: P, position2: L, position3: A -> but wait, that would put A in the 3rd? 
        Actually, no: the word ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> so A is in the 3rd position? 
        But we are looking for A in the second? 

     Actually, if we put A in the second position, the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""mane"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

     How about: ""banes"" -> but that ends with S, not E? We need to end with NE.

     Actually, we need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""sane"" is 4 letters. 
        ""wane"" is 4 letters.

     We need 5 letters. So we must have a 5-letter word. 

     How about: ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> that's 5 letters, but A is in the 3rd position? 
        Position1: P, Position2: L, Position3: A -> so A is in the 3rd.

     We need A in the second position? Then the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""jaune"" (not common) or ""gaunt"" doesn't end with E. 

     Actually, it's hard to find 5-letter words ending with ""NE"" that have A in the second position.

     Let me check: 
        ""bane"" is 4, so we can't use that. 
        ""cane"" is 4, and also has C which we know is not in the word.

     How about: ""dance""? But that ends with CE, not NE.

     We need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""mane"" is 4, so we need to add a letter? Actually, we can't. 

     Alternatively, we can consider that the word might have the same letter repeated? But we don't have any indication of that.

     After thinking, it's more common to have A in the first position for words ending with NE.

     So let's focus on A in the first position.

   ""shane"" -> S H A N E -> A is in the third?

 Why ""atone""? 
   - It uses common letters T and O.
   - We avoid C and R.

 But note: we don't know if the word has T or O. This guess will help us find out.

 Alternatively, we can try ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> which tests L and O.

 Or ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E -> tests M and I.

 Which one is better? We want to maximize information.

 Since we have two unknown letters, we can choose a word that has two new common letters.

 Let's choose ""alone"": because L and O are common.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and R are excluded. So L and O are safe.

 So I will go with ""alone"".

 However, we must note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has an 'A' but not in the 3rd position. In ""alone"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the secret word has A in the 1st, then we get a ✓ for A. If the secret word has A in the 2nd, then we get a '-' for A (because it's present but not in the 1st). So this guess will help us determine the position of A.

 Also, we are testing L and O.

 Therefore, let's guess ""alone"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has A in the second position? Then in ""alone"", the A is in the first, so we would get a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position? Then we would know that A must be in the second position.

 So ""alone"" is a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the second position? But we don't have a candidate. So let's stick with ""alone"".

 But note: we must avoid using the same letters that we already know are not in the word (C and R). ""alone"" does not contain C or R.

 So I choose ""alone"".

<guess>alone</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- ""A"" is in the word but not in the 3rd position (marked ""-"").
- ""N"" is correct and in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").
- ""E"" is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the following constraints:
- Format: `_ _ _ N E`
- Contains ""A"" in either the 1st or 2nd position (since it cannot be in the 3rd).
- Excludes ""C"" and ""R"".

For the next guess, I chose **""alone""** because:
- It places ""A"" in the 1st position to test if ""A"" belongs there (if not, it must be in the 2nd position).
- It introduces new common letters ""L"" and ""O"" to gather more information.
- It adheres to the known constraints (ends with ""NE"", avoids ""C"" and ""R"").",Guess 2: alone -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: ✓ (correct position)
 E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter 'A' but not in the position we guessed (which was the 3rd position in ""crane"").
 - The letter 'N' is in the 4th position and the letter 'E' is in the 5th position.
 - The letters 'C' and 'R' are not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ N E

 Also, the word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4th: N, 5th: E), we can try to find a word that fits.

 We must avoid using 'C' and 'R' because they are not in the word.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and have an 'A' somewhere (but not in the 3rd position).

 The positions for 'A' can be 1st or 2nd (since 3rd is excluded and 4th and 5th are fixed as N and E).

 We also have to consider that we have two unknown letters (positions 1, 2, and 3) but note that the 3rd position is the one before N.

 However, we have only two positions left for the 'A' and the other two letters (since we have three positions: 1,2,3 but one of them must be 'A' and the others are unknown).

 But note: the feedback for 'A' was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So it must be in position 1 or 2.

 We also don't know what the other two letters are (for positions 1, 2, and 3) except that they cannot be 'C' or 'R'.

 Let's try to think of words ending with ""NE"" that have an 'A' in the first or second position.

 Some possibilities:

 - If 'A' is in the 1st position: A _ _ N E
   Examples: ""axone"", ""amine"", ""alone"", ""atone"", ""agone"", etc.

 - If 'A' is in the 2nd position: _ A _ N E
   Examples: ""mane"", but ""mane"" is 4 letters -> we need 5 letters. So: ""plane"", ""crane"" (but we already tried crane and it had A in the 3rd? Actually in ""crane"", A was in the 3rd position? Let me check: 
     crane: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). So we know A is not in 3rd, so we cannot use words with A in 3rd.

 But note: in our feedback, we have A as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 3rd position. So in the new word, we must have A in either 1st or 2nd.

 However, we already tried ""crane"" and it had A in the 3rd, which is why we got a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning that in the secret word, A is present but not in the 3rd position. So in the secret word, A is not in the 3rd position.

 Therefore, we can try words with A in the 1st or 2nd.

 Let's consider the constraints:

 - The word must have the letters: A (in position 1 or 2), N (in position 4), E (in position 5).
 - The word must not contain C or R.

 We also have two more letters to fill in positions 2 and 3 (if A is in 1) or positions 1 and 3 (if A is in 2).

 We have 6 tries, so we can try a word that tests common letters.

 Since we have two fixed positions (4 and 5) and one known letter (A) that must be in position 1 or 2, we can try to use a word that has A in the 1st position to test that.

 But note: we also have to avoid using the letters that we know are not in the word (C and R).

 Let me list some words:

 Option 1: A in the first position: A _ _ N E
   We need two letters for positions 2 and 3. They can be any letters except C and R.

   Examples: 
     ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> but we don't know if L and O are in the word.
     ""atone"": A, T, O, N, E
     ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E
     ""agone"": A, G, O, N, E

 Option 2: A in the second position: _ A _ N E
   Examples:
     ""plane"": P, L, A, N, E -> but we have A in the 3rd? Actually, in ""plane"": 
        position1: P, position2: L, position3: A -> but wait, that would put A in the 3rd? 
        Actually, no: the word ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> so A is in the 3rd position? 
        But we are looking for A in the second? 

     Actually, if we put A in the second position, the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""mane"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So we need a 5-letter word with A in the second position.

     How about: ""banes"" -> but that ends with S, not E? We need to end with NE.

     Actually, we need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""sane"" is 4 letters. 
        ""wane"" is 4 letters.

     We need 5 letters. So we must have a 5-letter word. 

     How about: ""plane"" is P-L-A-N-E -> that's 5 letters, but A is in the 3rd position? 
        Position1: P, Position2: L, Position3: A -> so A is in the 3rd.

     We need A in the second position? Then the word would be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Example: ""jaune"" (not common) or ""gaunt"" doesn't end with E. 

     Actually, it's hard to find 5-letter words ending with ""NE"" that have A in the second position.

     Let me check: 
        ""bane"" is 4, so we can't use that. 
        ""cane"" is 4, and also has C which we know is not in the word.

     How about: ""dance""? But that ends with CE, not NE.

     We need the last two to be NE. So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] N E.

     Examples: 
        ""mane"" is 4, so we need to add a letter? Actually, we can't. 

     Alternatively, we can consider that the word might have the same letter repeated? But we don't have any indication of that.

     After thinking, it's more common to have A in the first position for words ending with NE.

     So let's focus on A in the first position.

 We have two unknown letters (positions 2 and 3). We can try to use a word that has common consonants in positions 2 and 3.

 We also want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Since we have only 6 tries, we should try to cover common letters.

 We know that the word has at least the letters: A, N, E.

 We don't know the other two letters. They can be any letter except C and R.

 Let's try a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, L, S, etc.

 We can try ""atone"": 
   A in 1st, T in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, E in 5th.

 But note: we already know that N and E are in the correct positions, so we are testing the first three.

 Alternatively, we can try ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E.

 However, we have to consider that we might have the letter 'A' in the second position? But we don't have a good candidate for that.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in the first position but tests the second position? But we don't have a candidate.

 Another idea: we can try a word that has A in the second position and also tests other common letters? But we don't have a word ending with NE and A in the second.

 Let me double-check: are there any 5-letter words ending with ""NE"" that have A in the second position?

 I can think of: 
   ""plane"" -> but that has A in the third? 
   ""shane"" -> S H A N E -> A is in the third? 
   ""crane"" -> we tried and A was in the third.

 Actually, in the word ""crane"", A was in the third. So we need a word that has A in the second? 

 How about: ""bakes"" -> doesn't end with NE.

 It seems difficult. Maybe we should consider that the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any feedback about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we might have misjudged: the feedback for ""crane"" was for the entire word. The secret word has an 'A' but not in the third position. So if we try a word that has A in the first or second, we might get a ✓ for A if it is in the correct position.

 Since we don't have a candidate for A in the second, let's try A in the first.

 We'll try ""atone"": 
   A in 1st, T in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, E in 5th.

 Why ""atone""? 
   - It uses common letters T and O.
   - We avoid C and R.

 But note: we don't know if the word has T or O. This guess will help us find out.

 Alternatively, we can try ""alone"": A, L, O, N, E -> which tests L and O.

 Or ""amine"": A, M, I, N, E -> tests M and I.

 Which one is better? We want to maximize information.

 Since we have two unknown letters, we can choose a word that has two new common letters.

 Let's choose ""alone"": because L and O are common.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and R are excluded. So L and O are safe.

 So I will go with ""alone"".

 However, we must note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has an 'A' but not in the 3rd position. In ""alone"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the secret word has A in the 1st, then we get a ✓ for A. If the secret word has A in the 2nd, then we get a '-' for A (because it's present but not in the 1st). So this guess will help us determine the position of A.

 Also, we are testing L and O.

 Therefore, let's guess ""alone"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has A in the second position? Then in ""alone"", the A is in the first, so we would get a '-' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position? Then we would know that A must be in the second position.

 So ""alone"" is a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the second position? But we don't have a candidate. So let's stick with ""alone"".

 But note: we must avoid using the same letters that we already know are not in the word (C and R). ""alone"" does not contain C or R.

 So I choose ""alone"".

<guess>alone</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").

We want to maximize information.\n\n Since we have two unknown letters, we can choose a word that has two new common letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""alone"": because L and O are common.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. We know C and R are excluded. So L and O are safe.\n\n So I will go with ""alone"".\n\n However, we must note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the secret word has an \'A\' but not in the 3rd position. In ""alone"", we are putting A in the 1st position. If the secret word has A in the 1st, then we get a ✓ for A. If the secret word has A in the 2nd, then we get a \'-\' for A (because it\'s present but not in the 1st). So this guess will help us determine the position of A.\n\n Also, we are testing L and O.\n\n Therefore, let\'s guess ""alone"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has A in the second position? Then in ""alone"", the A is in the first, so we would get a \'-\' for A? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the first position? Then we would know that A must be in the second position.\n\n So ""alone"" is a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the second position? But we don\'t have a candidate. So let\'s stick with ""alone"".\n\n But note: we must avoid using the same letters that we already know are not in the word (C and R). ""alone"" does not contain C or R.\n\n So I choose ""alone"".\n\n<guess>alone</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- ""A"" is in the word but not in the 3rd position (marked ""-"").\n- ""N"" is correct and in the 4th position (marked ""✓"").\n- ""E"" is correct and in the 5th position (marked ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the following constraints:\n- Format: `_ _ _ N E`\n- Contains ""A"" in either the 1st or 2nd position (since it cannot be in the 3rd).\n- Excludes ""C"" and ""R"".\n\nFor the next guess, I chose **""alone""** because:\n- It places ""A"" in the 1st position to test if ""A"" belongs there (if not, it must be in the 2nd position).\n- It introduces new common letters ""L"" and ""O"" to gather more information.\n- It adheres to the known constraints (ends with ""NE"", avoids ""C"" and ""R"").\n\n<guess>alone</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: alone -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: ✓ (correct position, so 4th letter is N)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so 5th letter is E)

Second guess: ""alone""
  A: ✓ (so A is in the 1st position? But wait, in ""alone"", A is in the 1st position. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is not in the 3rd, but now we see it is in the 1st? Let me check the feedback again.)

But note: the feedback for ""alone"" is: A(✓) L(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

This means:
  A: ✓ -> correct and in the correct position (1st)
  L: x -> not in the word
  O: ✓ -> correct and in the correct position (3rd? Let's see: alone -> A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). So O is in the 3rd position and is correct.
  N: ✓ -> 4th position, correct
  E: ✓ -> 5th position, correct

So now we know:
  The secret word has the form: A _ O N E

Because:
  A is in the 1st position (from the ✓ in ""alone"")
  O is in the 3rd position (from the ✓ in ""alone"")
  N is in the 4th position (from both guesses)
  E is in the 5th position (from both guesses)

Also, we know:
  The second letter is unknown, but we know it cannot be:
    - C (from first guess)
    - R (from first guess)
    - L (from second guess, because L is marked x)

Additionally, we know that the word has the letter A, but now we know it's in the first position. Also, we have O in the third.

So the word is: A _ O N E

We need to find the second letter. It must be a letter that is not C, R, or L, and it must form a valid English word.

We also know from the first guess that the word does not contain C or R, and from the second guess that it does not contain L.

So what letters can we use? We have 23 letters left (excluding C, R, L). But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  - ""atone"" -> but we have A _ O N E, so if we put T in the second, it would be ""a t o n e"" -> ""atone"". Is that a word? Yes.

But wait, we already have the third letter as O, so ""atone"" would be A, T, O, N, E -> which matches the pattern.

But we haven't tried T yet? We don't know if T is in the word. However, we can try ""atone"" as a guess.

But note: we are on our third guess, and we have a very constrained pattern. We can try ""atone"" to see if T is the missing letter.

Alternatively, we can try to think of other possibilities? What other letters can be in the second position?

Examples:
  - ""alone"" -> we tried, but L is not in the word, so that's not it.
  - ""agone"" -> A, G, O, N, E -> ""agone"" is a word (meaning gone by, past).
  - ""amine"" -> A, M, I, N, E -> but that would require the third letter to be I, but we know the third letter is O? No, in our pattern the third letter is fixed as O.

Wait, no: the feedback from ""alone"" tells us that O is in the third position and correct. So the third letter must be O.

Therefore, the word must be A ? O N E, so the only unknown is the second letter.

So the word is of the form: A X O N E, where X is a letter that is not C, R, or L.

What are the possible words?
  - ""atone"" -> with X = T
  - ""agone"" -> with X = G
  - ""abone"" -> not a word
  - ""adone"" -> not a word
  - ""aeone"" -> not a word
  - ""ahone"" -> not a word
  - ""akone"" -> not a word
  - ""azone"" -> not a word
  - ""avone"" -> not a word
  - ""awone"" -> not a word
  - ""axone"" -> a word (a type of neuron structure)
  - ""azone"" -> not common, but ""azone"" is not a standard word? Actually, ""azone"" might be a brand, but not a common word.

So the common words are: ""atone"", ""agone"", and maybe ""axone"".

But note: ""agone"" is an archaic word, so it might not be in the Wordle dictionary. Similarly, ""axone"" is scientific.

The most common word is ""atone"".

We also have to consider that we haven't tested the letter T. We know that if we guess ""atone"", then:
  - If the second letter is T, we get it right.
  - If not, we get feedback that T is not in the word, and then we can try other letters.

But we have only 4 guesses left (since we've used 2). We can try ""atone"" and if it's not correct, we can try ""agone"" next.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses many new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing. So it's better to just try one of the candidates.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Given that, I think ""atone"" is a good guess.

But let me check: we know the word has A, O, N, E, and one more letter. We don't have any information about T, so we can try it.

So I will guess ""atone"".

But note: we must be cautious. The feedback from the first guess said that A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. Now we have A in the 1st and O in the 3rd. So that's consistent.

Also, in ""atone"", the letters are A, T, O, N, E. We know O, N, E are in the correct positions. A is also in the correct position. So if T is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on T.

But what if the word is ""agone""? Then we would get T as not in the word, and then we can try ""agone"" next.

So let's go with ""atone"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - `C` and `R` are **not** in the word.  
  - `A` is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
  - `N` is correct and in **position 4**.  
  - `E` is correct and in **position 5**.  

- **Guess 2 (alone)**:  
  - `A` is correct and in **position 1** (resolving the earlier hint about `A`).  
  - `L` is **not** in the word.  
  - `O` is correct and in **position 3**.  
  - `N` and `E` remain correct in positions 4 and 5.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed structure: **A \_ O N E** (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are confirmed).  
- The missing letter (position 2) must be a letter **not** in `C`, `R`, or `L` (excluded from feedback).  
- Possible candidates include **atone** (with `T`), **agone** (with `G`), or **axone** (with `X`).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **atone** is a strong guess because:  
  - It tests `T` (a common letter) in position 2.  
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on `T` will confirm if it's in the word (narrowing to `G`, `X`, or other options).
