We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess:
 Word: C R A N E
 Feedback: x, x, -, x, -
 Meaning:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   N: not in the word (x)
   E: in the word but in the wrong position (-)

 So we know:
   The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (since we had it in the 3rd and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   The word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since we had it at the end and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N in our next guess.

 Since A and E are in the word, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

 Now, let's think about positions:
   We put A in position 3 and E in position 5 and both were wrong. So A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We should try to place A and E in other positions.

 Common vowels: A, E (we already have these) and other vowels are I, O, U (but sometimes Y). We might try to include other vowels to test.

 But since we only have two confirmed letters (A and E), we should try a word that has A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Also, we can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me think of a word that:
   - Doesn't contain C, R, N
   - Contains A and E (and we'll put them in positions that are not 3 and 5 from the first guess, respectively)

 Possible positions for A: can be 1, 2, 4? Because it was in 3 and was wrong.
 Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.

 So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.

 Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.

 Possible words: 
   SAUTE? S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S in 1, A in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 and we were told E is not in position 5? Actually the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can try E in position 5 again? No, because we know it's not at position 5? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.

 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there's an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn't get a ✓ only because we didn't have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.

 So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven't tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.

 So for our next word, let's try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).

 I'll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.

 Example: 
   Let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".

 Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn't test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn't have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Let me choose a word that includes S and T.

 Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn't a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. 
   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.

 But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let's check:
   S: new
   L: new
   A: we know A is in the word
   T: new
   E: we know E is in the word

 And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? 
   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let's rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.

 We know A can't be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.

 Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? 
   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.
   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.

 Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.

 So STEAD:
   S is at 1
   T is at 2
   E is at 3 (we don't know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)
   A is at 4 (new for A, didn't try position 4 before)
   D is at 5

 This way we test:
   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn't been tested for E)
   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)

 Also, we test S, T, D.

 I think this is a good candidate.

 Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn't A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.

 Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we'll get a '-'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don't get new information? We should avoid that.

 And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don't know about T? It's acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.

 So I choose STEAD.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they're in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).
- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.
- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.

A suitable word is **""STEAD""**:
- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  
  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.

<guess>stead</guess>",stead,"We have feedback from the first guess:

 Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.

 So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.

 Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.

However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.

 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates.

So we know for sure position 3 is not A.

 So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven't tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.

 So for our next word, let's try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).

 I'll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.

 Example: 
   Let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".

 Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn't test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn't have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Let me choose a word that includes S and T.

 Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn't a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. 
   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.

 But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let's check:
   S: new
   L: new
   A: we know A is in the word
   T: new
   E: we know E is in the word

 And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? 
   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let's rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.

 We know A can't be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.

 Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? 
   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.

   S is at 1
   T is at 2
   E is at 3 (we don't know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)
   A is at 4 (new for A, didn't try position 4 before)
   D is at 5

 This way we test:
   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn't been tested for E)
   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)

 Also, we test S, T, D.

 I think this is a good candidate.

 Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn't A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.

Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.

 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there's an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn't get a ✓ only because we didn't have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.

 So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven't tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.

 So for our next word, let's try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).

 I'll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.

 Example: 
   Let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".

 Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn't test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn't have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Let me choose a word that includes S and T.

 Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn't a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. 
   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.

 But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let's check:
   S: new
   L: new
   A: we know A is in the word
   T: new
   E: we know E is in the word

 And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? 
   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let's rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.

 We know A can't be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.

 Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? 
   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.
   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.

 Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.

 So STEAD:
   S is at 1
   T is at 2
   E is at 3 (we don't know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)
   A is at 4 (new for A, didn't try position 4 before)
   D is at 5

 This way we test:
   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn't been tested for E)
   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)

 Also, we test S, T, D.

 I think this is a good candidate.

 Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn't A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.

 Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we'll get a '-'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don't get new information? We should avoid that.

 And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don't know about T? It's acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.

 So I choose STEAD.

<guess>stead</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they're in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).
- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.
- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.

A suitable word is **""STEAD""**:
- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  
  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

So what we know:
- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it's not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.

We have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don't know.

The word has 5 letters. We know:
- Position 4: A
- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)

But note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the word has: 
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.

We also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).

Now, we need to think of words that have:
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.

We can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it's wrong, we'll know E is in position 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ 
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

If E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _

We can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a '-' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it's not the correct position, we would get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don't get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _
Examples: 
  E L U L A? Not 5. 
  E C H O A? But C is absent. 
  E G G A R? R absent. 
  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know. 
  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. 
  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.

We must avoid S.

So let's think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words: 
  E L B O A? Not a word.
  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.
  E M B A R? R absent.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

This is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _
Examples: 
  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _

So: 
  Position 1: some letter
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: some letter
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: some letter

And we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that's fine.

Common words: 
  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? 
  But let's check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that's L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.

We need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

Examples: 
  B E L A H? Not a word.
  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So:

  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: ?

Words: 
  P E B A K? Not a word.
  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? 
  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.

  B E T A S? S absent.
  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.

  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.

But let's think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words: 
  E C H A O? C absent.
  E L U A ? -> not 5.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? 
  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. 
  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.

  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.

We need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.

  E L M I A? Not a word.

  E P O A K? Not a word.

This is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn't have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it's fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it's fixed.

So in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.

So the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _

And we know E is in position 1 or 2.

So we have two cases:

Case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
Case 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)

Let's try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _

Possible words:
  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.

  G E M A L? Not a word.

  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.

  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.

  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.

  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It's a dish. But let's check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.

  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.

  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.

  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  B E Z A L? Not a word.

  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.

  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That's not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.

  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.

  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.

  Q E P A ? -> not a word.

  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.

  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.

So from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.

BELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y
PELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U

Both have E in position 2 and L in position 3.

Now, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words:
  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.
  E C A ? -> not.
  E F A ? -> not.
  E G A ? -> not.
  E H A ? -> not.
  E J A ? -> not.
  E K A ? -> not.
  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.
  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.
  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.
  E Q A ? -> not.
  E U O A ? -> not.
  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.
  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.
  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.
  E Z A ? -> not.

  E L U L A? Not 5.

  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.

  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.

  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.

  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.

  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.

  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.

  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.

  E X P O A? Not 5.

So I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 2.

So we can try either BELAY or PELAU.

But we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.

BELAY has B, L, Y.
PELAU has P, L, U.

Both have L in position 3. We don't know if L is in the word.

We can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.

I think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don't have many common letters left.

Another word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.

Or ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.

Another idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got '-', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.

So WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for E.

Therefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn't find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.

Let me try to find more words for case 2.

What about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.

""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

""VELA"" is 4 letters.

""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.

""PEDAL""? D absent.

""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it's a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested L, G.

But in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it's a valid word.

But let's see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x's? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don't know.

But we have to choose a word.

Another word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.

""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.

I think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.

I'll go with BELAY.

So guess: BELAY

But let's confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y

We have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.

If E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word for position 1, so if BELAY fails for E, we might have to try a different word for position 1? But we'll see.

So I'll guess BELAY.

<guess>belay</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 4** (from Guess 2: ""stead"" had A(✓)).
- **E is present** but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: E(-) in position 3) or position 5 (from Guess 1: E(-) in position 5). Since position 4 is occupied by A, E must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, D (from Guess 1 and 2 feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters and confirmed A/E).

Given this, the next guess should:
- Place **A in position 4** (confirmed).
- Test **E in position 2** (since no valid words with E in position 1 were found, and position 3/5 are invalid for E).
- Test new common consonants (e.g., B, L, Y) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters and duplicates (for efficiency).

The word **""BELAY""** fits these criteria:
- **B** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.
- **E** (position 2): Tests E in a valid candidate position.
- **L** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
- **A** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.

If E is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm E must be in position 1 for future guesses. This maximizes information gain.

<guess>belay</guess>",belay,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

So what we know:
- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it's not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.

We have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don't know.

The word has 5 letters. We know:
- Position 4: A
- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)

But note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the word has: 
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.

We also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).

Now, we need to think of words that have:
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.

We can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it's wrong, we'll know E is in position 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ 
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

If E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _

We can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a '-' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it's not the correct position, we would get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don't get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _
Examples: 
  E L U L A? Not 5. 
  E C H O A? But C is absent. 
  E G G A R? R absent. 
  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know. 
  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. 
  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.

We must avoid S.

So let's think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words: 
  E L B O A? Not a word.
  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.
  E M B A R? R absent.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

This is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _
Examples: 
  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _

So: 
  Position 1: some letter
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: some letter
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: some letter

And we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that's fine.

Common words: 
  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? 
  But let's check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that's L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.

We need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

Examples: 
  B E L A H? Not a word.
  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So:

  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: ?

Words: 
  P E B A K? Not a word.
  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? 
  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.

  B E T A S? S absent.
  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.

  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.

But let's think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words: 
  E C H A O? C absent.
  E L U A ? -> not 5.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? 
  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. 
  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.

  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.

We need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.

  E L M I A? Not a word.

  E P O A K? Not a word.

This is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn't have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it's fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it's fixed.

So in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.

So the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _

And we know E is in position 1 or 2.

So we have two cases:

Case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
Case 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)

Let's try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _

Possible words:
  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.

  G E M A L? Not a word.

  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.

  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.

  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.

  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It's a dish. But let's check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.

  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.

  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.

  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  B E Z A L? Not a word.

  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.

  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That's not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.

  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.

  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.

  Q E P A ? -> not a word.

  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.

  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.

So from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.

BELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y
PELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U

Both have E in position 2 and L in position 3.

Now, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words:
  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.
  E C A ? -> not.
  E F A ? -> not.
  E G A ? -> not.
  E H A ? -> not.
  E J A ? -> not.
  E K A ? -> not.
  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.
  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.
  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.
  E Q A ? -> not.
  E U O A ? -> not.
  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.
  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.
  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.
  E Z A ? -> not.

  E L U L A? Not 5.

  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.

  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.

  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.

  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.

  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.

  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.

  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.

  E X P O A? Not 5.

So I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 2.

So we can try either BELAY or PELAU.

But we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.

BELAY has B, L, Y.
PELAU has P, L, U.

Both have L in position 3. We don't know if L is in the word.

We can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.

I think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don't have many common letters left.

Another word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.

Or ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.

Another idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got '-', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.

So WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for E.

Therefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn't find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.

Let me try to find more words for case 2.

What about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.

""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

""VELA"" is 4 letters.

""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.

""PEDAL""? D absent.

""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it's a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested L, G.

But in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it's a valid word.

But let's see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x's? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don't know.

But we have to choose a word.

Another word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.

""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.

I think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.

I'll go with BELAY.

So guess: BELAY

But let's confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y

We have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.

If E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word for position 1, so if BELAY fails for E, we might have to try a different word for position 1? But we'll see.

So I'll guess BELAY.

<guess>belay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 4** (from Guess 2: ""stead"" had A(✓)).
- **E is present** but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: E(-) in position 3) or position 5 (from Guess 1: E(-) in position 5). Since position 4 is occupied by A, E must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, D (from Guess 1 and 2 feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters and confirmed A/E).

Given this, the next guess should:
- Place **A in position 4** (confirmed).
- Test **E in position 2** (since no valid words with E in position 1 were found, and position 3/5 are invalid for E).
- Test new common consonants (e.g., B, L, Y) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters and duplicates (for efficiency).

The word **""BELAY""** fits these criteria:
- **B** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.
- **E** (position 2): Tests E in a valid candidate position.
- **L** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
- **A** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.

If E is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm E must be in position 1 for future guesses. This maximizes information gain.",Guess 3: belay -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) A(✓) Y(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

   The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (since we had it in the 3rd and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   The word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since we had it at the end and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N in our next guess.

 Since A and E are in the word, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

 Now, let's think about positions:
   We put A in position 3 and E in position 5 and both were wrong. So A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We should try to place A and E in other positions.

 Common vowels: A, E (we already have these) and other vowels are I, O, U (but sometimes Y). We might try to include other vowels to test.

 But since we only have two confirmed letters (A and E), we should try a word that has A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Also, we can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me think of a word that:
   - Doesn't contain C, R, N
   - Contains A and E (and we'll put them in positions that are not 3 and 5 from the first guess, respectively)

 Possible positions for A: can be 1, 2, 4? Because it was in 3 and was wrong.
 Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.

 So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.

 Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.

 Possible words: 
   SAUTE? S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S in 1, A in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 and we were told E is not in position 5? Actually the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can try E in position 5 again? No, because we know it's not at position 5? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.

 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there's an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn't get a ✓ only because we didn't have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.

 So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven't tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.

 So for our next word, let's try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).

 I'll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.

 Example: 
   Let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".

 Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn't test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn't have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Let me choose a word that includes S and T.

 Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn't a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. 
   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.

 But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let's check:
   S: new
   L: new
   A: we know A is in the word
   T: new
   E: we know E is in the word

 And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? 
   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let's rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.

 We know A can't be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.

 Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? 
   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.
   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.

 Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.

 So STEAD:
   S is at 1
   T is at 2
   E is at 3 (we don't know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)
   A is at 4 (new for A, didn't try position 4 before)
   D is at 5

 This way we test:
   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn't been tested for E)
   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)

 Also, we test S, T, D.

 I think this is a good candidate.

 Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn't A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.

 Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we'll get a '-'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don't get new information? We should avoid that.

 And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don't know about T? It's acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.

 So I choose STEAD.

<guess>stead</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they're in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).
- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.
- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.

A suitable word is **""STEAD""**:
- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  
  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.

<guess>stead</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

So what we know:
- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it's not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.

We have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don't know.

The word has 5 letters. We know:
- Position 4: A
- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)

But note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the word has: 
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.

We also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).

Now, we need to think of words that have:
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.

We can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it's wrong, we'll know E is in position 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ 
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

If E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _

We can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a '-' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it's not the correct position, we would get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don't get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _
Examples: 
  E L U L A? Not 5. 
  E C H O A? But C is absent. 
  E G G A R? R absent. 
  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know. 
  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. 
  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.

We must avoid S.

So let's think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words: 
  E L B O A? Not a word.
  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.
  E M B A R? R absent.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

This is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _
Examples: 
  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _

So: 
  Position 1: some letter
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: some letter
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: some letter

And we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that's fine.

Common words: 
  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? 
  But let's check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that's L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.

We need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

Examples: 
  B E L A H? Not a word.
  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So:

  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: ?

Words: 
  P E B A K? Not a word.
  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? 
  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.

  B E T A S? S absent.
  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.

  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.

But let's think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words: 
  E C H A O? C absent.
  E L U A ? -> not 5.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? 
  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. 
  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.

  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.

We need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.

  E L M I A? Not a word.

  E P O A K? Not a word.

This is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn't have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it's fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it's fixed.

So in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.

So the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _

And we know E is in position 1 or 2.

So we have two cases:

Case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
Case 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)

Let's try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _

Possible words:
  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.

  G E M A L? Not a word.

  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.

  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.

  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.

  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It's a dish. But let's check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.

  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.

  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.

  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  B E Z A L? Not a word.

  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.

  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That's not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.

  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.

  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.

  Q E P A ? -> not a word.

  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.

  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.

So from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.

BELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y
PELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U

Both have E in position 2 and L in position 3.

Now, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words:
  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.
  E C A ? -> not.
  E F A ? -> not.
  E G A ? -> not.
  E H A ? -> not.
  E J A ? -> not.
  E K A ? -> not.
  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.
  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.
  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.
  E Q A ? -> not.
  E U O A ? -> not.
  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.
  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.
  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.
  E Z A ? -> not.

  E L U L A? Not 5.

  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.

  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.

  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.

  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.

  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.

  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.

  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.

  E X P O A? Not 5.

So I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 2.

So we can try either BELAY or PELAU.

But we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.

BELAY has B, L, Y.
PELAU has P, L, U.

Both have L in position 3. We don't know if L is in the word.

We can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.

I think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don't have many common letters left.

Another word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.

Or ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.

Another idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got '-', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.

So WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for E.

Therefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn't find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.

Let me try to find more words for case 2.

What about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.

""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

""VELA"" is 4 letters.

""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.

""PEDAL""? D absent.

""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it's a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested L, G.

But in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it's a valid word.

But let's see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x's? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don't know.

But we have to choose a word.

Another word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.

""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.

I think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.

I'll go with BELAY.

So guess: BELAY

But let's confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y

We have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.

If E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word for position 1, so if BELAY fails for E, we might have to try a different word for position 1? But we'll see.

So I'll guess BELAY.

<guess>belay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 4** (from Guess 2: ""stead"" had A(✓)).
- **E is present** but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: E(-) in position 3) or position 5 (from Guess 1: E(-) in position 5). Since position 4 is occupied by A, E must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, D (from Guess 1 and 2 feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters and confirmed A/E).

Given this, the next guess should:
- Place **A in position 4** (confirmed).
- Test **E in position 2** (since no valid words with E in position 1 were found, and position 3/5 are invalid for E).
- Test new common consonants (e.g., B, L, Y) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters and duplicates (for efficiency).

The word **""BELAY""** fits these criteria:
- **B** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.
- **E** (position 2): Tests E in a valid candidate position.
- **L** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
- **A** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.

If E is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm E must be in position 1 for future guesses. This maximizes information gain.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.\n Also, including at least two vowels is good.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess:\n Word: C R A N E\n Feedback: x, x, -, x, -\n Meaning:\n   C: not in the word (x)\n   R: not in the word (x)\n   A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n   N: not in the word (x)\n   E: in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n\n So we know:\n   The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (since we had it in the 3rd and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   The word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since we had it at the end and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, N in our next guess.\n\n Since A and E are in the word, we should include them again, but in different positions.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.\n\n Now, let\'s think about positions:\n   We put A in position 3 and E in position 5 and both were wrong. So A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We should try to place A and E in other positions.\n\n Common vowels: A, E (we already have these) and other vowels are I, O, U (but sometimes Y). We might try to include other vowels to test.\n\n But since we only have two confirmed letters (A and E), we should try a word that has A and E, and avoid C, R, N.\n\n Also, we can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let me think of a word that:\n   - Doesn\'t contain C, R, N\n   - Contains A and E (and we\'ll put them in positions that are not 3 and 5 from the first guess, respectively)\n\n Possible positions for A: can be 1, 2, 4? Because it was in 3 and was wrong.\n Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?\n\n Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.\n\n So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.\n\n Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.\n\n Possible words: \n   SAUTE? S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S in 1, A in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 and we were told E is not in position 5? Actually the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can try E in position 5 again? No, because we know it\'s not at position 5? Actually, no: the \'-\' means it\'s in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don\'t know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there\'s an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn\'t get a ✓ only because we didn\'t have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.\n\n So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven\'t tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.\n\n Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.\n\n So for our next word, let\'s try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).\n\n I\'ll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.\n\n Example: \n   Let\'s put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn\'t test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn\'t have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven\'t tested S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes S and T.\n\n Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn\'t a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. \n   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.\n\n But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let\'s check:\n   S: new\n   L: new\n   A: we know A is in the word\n   T: new\n   E: we know E is in the word\n\n And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? \n   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let\'s rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.\n\n We know A can\'t be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again.\n\n Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.\n\n Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? \n   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.\n   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.\n\n Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.\n\n So STEAD:\n   S is at 1\n   T is at 2\n   E is at 3 (we don\'t know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)\n   A is at 4 (new for A, didn\'t try position 4 before)\n   D is at 5\n\n This way we test:\n   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn\'t been tested for E)\n   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)\n\n Also, we test S, T, D.\n\n I think this is a good candidate.\n\n Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn\'t A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.\n\n Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we\'ll get a \'-\'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don\'t get new information? We should avoid that.\n\n And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don\'t know about T? It\'s acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.\n\n So I choose STEAD.\n\n<guess>stead</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **E** (since they\'re in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).\n- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.\n- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.\n\nA suitable word is **""STEAD""**:\n- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  \n  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.\n\n<guess>stead</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: x (absent)\n- A: - (present, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: STEAD\n- S: x (absent)\n- T: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got \'-\']\n- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)\n- D: x (absent)\n\nSo what we know:\n- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).\n- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it\'s not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.\n\nWe have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don\'t know.\n\nThe word has 5 letters. We know:\n- Position 4: A\n- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.\n- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don\'t know about duplicates? But we haven\'t seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we can\'t be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let\'s assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\nSo the word has: \n- Position 4: A\n- E in position 1 or 2.\n- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).\n\nNow, we need to think of words that have:\n- Position 4: A\n- E in position 1 or 2.\n- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.\n\nSo available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.\n\nWe can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it\'s wrong, we\'ll know E is in position 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.\n\nBut we also need to test the other positions.\n\nLet me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ \nWe need to fill positions 2,3,5.\n\nIf E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _\n\nWe can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a \'-\' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it\'s not the correct position, we would get a \'-\' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don\'t get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _\nExamples: \n  E L U L A? Not 5. \n  E C H O A? But C is absent. \n  E G G A R? R absent. \n  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don\'t know. \n  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. \n  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nSo let\'s think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nPossible words: \n  E L B O A? Not a word.\n  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.\n  E M B A R? R absent.\n  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don\'t know, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nThis is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?\n\nOption 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _\nExamples: \n  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: some letter\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: some letter\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: some letter\n\nAnd we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that\'s fine.\n\nCommon words: \n  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? \n  But let\'s check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that\'s L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.\n\nWe need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.\n\nExamples: \n  B E L A H? Not a word.\n  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A. So:\n\n  Position 1: ?\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: ?\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: ?\n\nWords: \n  P E B A K? Not a word.\n  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? \n  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.\n\n  B E T A S? S absent.\n  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.\n\nT is absent, so we cannot use T.\n\n  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. \n  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.\n\n  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _\n\nWords: \n  E C H A O? C absent.\n  E L U A ? -> not 5.\n  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? \n  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. \n  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.\n\n  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.\n\n  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.\n\n  E L M I A? Not a word.\n\n  E P O A K? Not a word.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn\'t have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a \'-\' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it\'s fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it\'s fixed.\n\nSo in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.\n\nSo the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _\n\nAnd we know E is in position 1 or 2.\n\nSo we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _\nCase 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)\n\nLet\'s try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _\n\nPossible words:\n  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.\n\n  G E M A L? Not a word.\n\n  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.\n\n  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates? But let\'s avoid for now.\n\n  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.\n\n  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.\n\n  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It\'s a dish. But let\'s check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.\n\n  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.\n\n  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.\n\n  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n  B E Z A L? Not a word.\n\n  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.\n\n  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That\'s not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.\n\n  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.\n\n  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.\n\n  Q E P A ? -> not a word.\n\n  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.\n\n  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.\n\nSo from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.\n\nBELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y\nPELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U\n\nBoth have E in position 2 and L in position 3.\n\nNow, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _\n\nWords:\n  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.\n  E C A ? -> not.\n  E F A ? -> not.\n  E G A ? -> not.\n  E H A ? -> not.\n  E J A ? -> not.\n  E K A ? -> not.\n  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.\n  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.\n  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.\n  E Q A ? -> not.\n  E U O A ? -> not.\n  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.\n  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.\n  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.\n  E Z A ? -> not.\n\n  E L U L A? Not 5.\n\n  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.\n\n  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.\n\n  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.\n\n  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.\n\n  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.\n\n  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.\n\n  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.\n\n  E X P O A? Not 5.\n\nSo I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it\'s more likely that E is in position 2.\n\nSo we can try either BELAY or PELAU.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters. We haven\'t tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.\n\nBELAY has B, L, Y.\nPELAU has P, L, U.\n\nBoth have L in position 3. We don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nWe can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.\n\nI think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don\'t have many common letters left.\n\nAnother word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.\n\nOr ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got \'-\', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.\n\nSo WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.\n\nSo we must avoid position 3 for E.\n\nTherefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn\'t find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.\n\nLet me try to find more words for case 2.\n\nWhat about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.\n\n""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n""VELA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.\n\n""PEDAL""? D absent.\n\n""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it\'s a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we haven\'t tested L, G.\n\nBut in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nBut we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x\'s? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we have to choose a word.\n\nAnother word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.\n\n""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.\n\nI think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.\n\nI\'ll go with BELAY.\n\nSo guess: BELAY\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y\n\nWe have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.\n\nIf E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5 was wrong]

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- D: absent (x)

Guess 3: BELAY
- B: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 2 is E]
- L: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- Y: absent (x)

Summary of what we know now:

- Position 2: E is correct (from BELAY: E✓)
- Position 4: A is correct (from STEAD and BELAY: A✓)
- E is in position 2, which we just confirmed.

Now, from BELAY feedback:
- L is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for L at position 3).

Also, from previous feedback:
- E is now confirmed at position 2, so the E in the word is fixed at position 2.
- A is fixed at position 4.
- We know L is in the word, but not at position 3.

Also, we have the following absent letters from all guesses:
- C (absent, G1)
- R (absent, G1)
- N (absent, G1)
- S (absent, G2)
- T (absent, G2)
- D (absent, G2)
- B (absent, G3)
- Y (absent, G3)

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y.

We also have E and A fixed.

The word pattern so far:
Position 1: unknown (but cannot be any absent letter)
Position 2: E (fixed)
Position 3: unknown (but not L? because L is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere? However, L is present so must be in position 1 or 5? Since position 3 is not L and positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
Position 4: A (fixed)
Position 5: unknown (but cannot be absent letters)

Now, L is present and not in position 3. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, L must be in either position 1 or position 5? Because those are the only positions left.

Word structure: _ E _ A _ 
We have to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

We know L is one of the missing letters and must be in position 1 or 5? Because position 3 is available but L cannot be at position 3 according to BELAY feedback? The '-' for L in position 3 means L is in the word but not at position 3. So yes, L must be at position 1 or 5.

Additionally, we have one more letter to find (since there are three positions: 1,3,5 and one of them is L? Not necessarily: L is one letter, but the other two positions are another letter? Or possibly duplicate? But we have no indication so far.

So, let the letters to find: let position 1, 3, and 5 be filled with letters that are not absent.

Available letters: we've ruled out C,R,N,S,T,D,B,Y.

So available: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? (and A and E are already used? But we don't know about duplicates. However, since L is already accounted for, and the word might have another L? But we have L only once so far? The word may have duplicates, but not indicated? We'll assume no duplicates unless needed? But we have to consider possibilities.

But L is present, so if L is at position 1 or 5, that's one position. The other two positions must be two new letters? Or one of them could be L? No, because L is one letter, and if we put L at position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L unless there are duplicate Ls? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for BELAY showed only one L? We haven't seen any indication of duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore:
- L must be in either position 1 or position 5.
- The other two positions: one letter for position 3 and one for the remaining position (1 or 5) and they must be from the available letters, excluding L? Because if L is in position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L? Similarly if L is in position 5, then positions 1 and 3 cannot be L? So the letters are distinct: two more letters besides L? Actually, we have three positions but only one L? So positions 1,3,5: one of them is L, and the other two are two other distinct letters from the available set.

So available letters excluding L: F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. (and we have 16 letters? But that's too many.)

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: _ E _ A _ 
With the first blank being either L or one of the other available letters? But L must fill one of the blanks in position 1 or 5.

Two scenarios:

Scenario A: L in position 1 -> word: L E _ A _ 
Then we need to fill position 3 and 5 with two letters from available (F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z). 

Scenario B: L in position 5 -> word: _ E _ A L 
Then we need to fill position 1 and 3 with two letters from available set (same as above).

We can try to guess a word that tests one scenario.

But we also know from the first guess: A was present but not at position 3. But A is now fixed at position 4? So that doesn't affect position 3 now. The A information is already used.

Also, we need to consider common words.

Let's think of words that fit:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _ 
The word must be L E ? A ? 
Possible words: 
  L E A K ? -> but absent letters? L E A K Y? No, Y absent. And K? But we need to fill position 5? LEAK is 4 letters? So not.
  L E G A L? But position 3: G, position 5: L -> duplicate L? And we have LEGAL? But we are assuming no duplicates? Alternatively, LEGAL has two Ls? So we cannot assume no duplicates? We have to consider it? But in this case, we know L is present? But in BELAY we had L at position 3 and now we are putting L at position 1? But the word LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? And we know L is present? Then in the feedback, for BELAY we had only one L? But if the word has L in multiple positions, and we guess only one? So it might not show? I'm confused.

To avoid complexity, let's try to think of words without duplicates first? But let's list.

Alternative: maybe L can be in position 3? But no, BELAY feedback: L at position 3 was wrong? So L is not in position 3. Therefore, for the current pattern, position 3 cannot be L.

So Scenario A and B are the options.

Let me search for words:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _
- L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
- L E V A ? -> LEVA? Not. 
- L E G A ? -> LEGA? Not. 
- L E M A L? But that's 5 if LEMAL? Not a word. 
- L E T A ? -> T absent? T is absent? 
- L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not a word? 
- LEGAL? But LEGAL: L E G A L -> position 5: L? Duplicate L? And word? Yes? And it has L at position 1 and L at position 5? We don't know? We can try? But we might get feedback for two Ls? However, in our guess BELAY we had only one L? So we don't know? So we can try LEGAL? But position 3: G? And available? Yes.

For Scenario B: _ E _ A L
- Words: ? E ? A L
- Examples: V E X A L? Not a word. 
- R E A L L? But R absent? 
- F E L L A? But L duplicate? And F E L L A -> positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4)? But position 4 is A? So not. 
- B E Z A L? Not. 
- G E M A L? Not a word? 
- H E M A L? HEMAL is a word? Yes? H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5). This fits? And H, M available? Yes. 
- M E T A L? T absent? 
- P E P A L? PEPAL? Not a word? 
- V E A L? VEAL is 4? 
- J E W A L? JEWEL with A? Not? J E W A L? Not a word? 
- K E P A L? Not. 
- D E V A L? D absent? and V? 
- L E V E L? But E duplicate? And A not at position 4. 

So from Scenario B, we have ""HEMAL"" which is a word? Meaning relating to the blood.

Also, in Scenario A, ""LEGAL"" is a word.

But LEGAL has L at position 1 and L at position 5? So if we guess LEGAL, and the word has only one L? Then we'll get L in position 1 maybe '-' and position 5 'x'? Or vice versa? But that's messy? We'll see.

But we also know that the word must have only one L? Or we don't know? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we need to test.

But we have two potential words: LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL uses H, M, L.

We have another clue: from the first guess, E was present but not in position 5? But now E is at position 2? So that doesn't help.

We also have position 3: from BELAY, we put L at position 3 and it was wrong. So position 3 might be any available letter.

To decide between Scenario A and B? We don't know? We can try a word that potentially fits one scenario? And test more common letters? 

But let's see available letters: many? We need to narrow down.

Another idea: we have to test a new set of letters? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try one.

Let me suggest guessing ""LEGAL""? Because it tests the scenario A? And includes G, which is common? And if it's wrong, we'll know more? But LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? If the word has only one L? Then one of them might be correct? Or both wrong? But we know L is present? So at least one L should be marked '-' or '✓'? But not both 'x'? Unless the L is in position 3? But we know it's not? So at least one L would be marked '-'?

But if we guess LEGAL: L E G A L? Feedback? 

But position 2 E is fixed, position 4 A is fixed? So we'll get feedback for position 1 L, position 3 G, position 5 L.

If the word has L in position 1: then L at position 1: if correct, we get ✓, else if wrong, we get -? But position 1 is L? And if L is at position 1, then ✓? Or if not, then -? And if L is in position 5? Then for position 5: ✓? But we'll see.

The problem is that if the word has L in position 5, then position 1 L would be '-' because it's not there? But duplicate? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses L only once? And tests more letters? Because if we guess LEGAL, it has two Ls? Maybe not efficient? We should test L only in one position to avoid confusion.

So better to test Scenario A with L at position 1 and a new letter at position 3 and 5? Or Scenario B with L at position 5 and new at position 1 and 3.

But if we test Scenario A: L E ? A ? 
Then we need to choose a word that fills position 3 and 5 with new letters?

Similarly for Scenario B.

But we don't have much to go on.

We know from the first guess that A was in the word? But we used that? Also, E in the word? Fixed.

Another common letter? We can try to fill with vowels? But we have O, I, U, etc.

Let's list quick words:

For L E _ A _ : 
  LEV?A -> not? 
  LEF?A -> LEFTA? T absent? 
  LEG?A -> LEGUA? Not.
  LEHA? LEHGA? Not a word? 
  LEI?A -> LEI A? Not.
  LEK?A -> not? 
  LEM?A LEM A? -> not. 
  LEP?A -> LEP A? Not.
  LEQ?A -> not.
  LEU?A LEUMA? Not? 
  LEV?A LEV A? -> LEVAN? Not? 
  LEW?A LEW A? Not.
  LEX?A LEX A? -> LEXIA? L E X I A? But I at position 5? The word would be L E X I A? Positions: L(1) E(2) X(3) I(4)? Wait, position 4 is A? So it must be L E X ? A ? -> L E X A ? -> LEXA? Not 5. 

For the other scenario: _ E _ A L
We have HEMAL? Which is a word? H E M A L -> meaning relating to the blood? Also, JEMAL? Not a word? FEMAL? Not? GEMAL? Not? 

Another word: V E X A L? Not a word? 
P E C A L? C absent? 
P E K A L? PEKAL? Not? 
P E P A L? Not? 
P E Z A L? Not? 
W E B A L? Not? 
X E B A L? Not? 

So only HEMAL is a clear word.

What about ""METAL""? Not? T absent? 

""PEDAL""? D absent? 

""VENAL""? V E N A L? N absent? 

""MEDIA""? M E D I A? D absent? 

""REALM""? R E A L M? R absent? 

So HEMAL is a valid option? Or LEGAL? Or maybe ""KOALA""? But K O A L A? No E? We have E fixed at position 2? So not.

Wait, another word for Scenario B: ""VELLAL""? Not a word? 

Or ""CELLAR""? But C and R absent? 

I think the only common words are LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL is less common.

Perhaps ""FECAL""? But C absent.

Another word: ""FEIAL""? Not a word? 

We might have to use LEGAL or HEMAL? But let's choose HEMAL because it tests H and M and has L only at position 5? So no duplicate L? So we can avoid duplication issue.

HEMAL: H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5)? So L at position 5. If the word has L at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? And if not, a '-'? But we know L is present? So if L is at position 5, it's the correct position? Otherwise, if L is at position 1, in HEMAL we have no L at position 1? So we'll get feedback for L at position 5: if it's not position 5, then '-'? But since we have L only once in the guess, then we'll know L is not at position 5? Then L must be at position 1? And then for position 5, we have L in HEMAL? So it might not match.

But if we want to test if L is at position 5, we can use HEMAL? Because it puts L in position 5. If we get L correct at position 5, great? If we get L present but in wrong position? That must mean L is at position 1? Because position 3 is not possible? And position 2 and 4 are fixed? So for the real word, L can only be at position 1 or 5? So if we put L at position 5 and it's not correct, we'll get a '-'? Then we know L is at position 1? So we can infer.

Therefore, guessing HEMAL will give us:

- If L is at position 5: then we get L(✓) at position 5? And also, M at position 3 and H at position 1? 
- If L is not at position 5: then we get L(-) meaning L is in another position? But we only have position 1 left? So it should be at position 1? And then position 5 is something else? But in HEMAL, position 5 is L? So the feedback will mark that L as '-'? And then we know L must be at position 1?

So yes, we'll get clear feedback.

Similarly, for the other letters: H at position 1, M at position 3.

We also test for the presence of H and M? We don't know about them yet.

So HEMAL is a good guess? Even though HEMAL is a medical term? But it's in English? Yes.

Alternative: we could try a different word? But we don't have many options.

We could try for Scenario A a word like ""LEM?A""? No word? 

Another word: ""PEAL""? Too short?  

Or ""LEVEL""? But E duplicate? 

I think HEMAL is acceptable.

So let's go with HEMAL.

Guess: H E M A L

But we have to write a word? So ""HEMAL"" is the word.

<guess>hemal</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the previous feedback:

1. **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y (marked ""x"" in past guesses: C, R, N from Guess 1; S, T, D from Guess 2; B, Y from Guess 3).
2. **Confirmed Fixed Positions:**
   - **Position 2: E (✓)** confirmed by Guess 3 (""belay"").
   - **Position 4: A (✓)** confirmed by Guess 2 (""stead"").
3. **Present Letters with Restrictions:**
   - **L (-):** Present in the word, but not in position 3 (per Guess 3 feedback).
   - **E (-):** Position 3 is invalid (per Guess 2 feedback) and position 5 is invalid (per Guess 1 feedback). Since position 2 is confirmed E, no further E positions need testing.
4. **Word Structure:**  
   The word follows: **[Pos1] E [Pos3] A [Pos5]**:
   - **Pos1:** Must contain a new letter or L (since L cannot be in position 3, and positions 2/4 are fixed, L must be in position 1 or 5).
   - **Pos3:** Any available letter except absent ones and L (L not allowed here).
   - **Pos5:** Must contain a new letter or L (if L is not in position 1).
   - **Available letters:** F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding known absent letters).
5. **Guessing Strategy:**
   - Test ""HEMAL"" to:
     - Put **L in position 5** to check if it matches the correct position. If L is ""x"" or ""-"", we can deduce L must be in position 1.
     - Test new letters **H (position 1)** and **M (position 3)**.
   - ""HEMAL"" (meaning ""relating to the blood"") fits the pattern and uses common rules for narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>hemal</guess>",hemal,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5 was wrong]

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- D: absent (x)

Guess 3: BELAY
- B: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 2 is E]
- L: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- Y: absent (x)

Summary of what we know now:

- Position 2: E is correct (from BELAY: E✓)
- Position 4: A is correct (from STEAD and BELAY: A✓)
- E is in position 2, which we just confirmed.

Now, from BELAY feedback:
- L is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for L at position 3).

Also, from previous feedback:
- E is now confirmed at position 2, so the E in the word is fixed at position 2.
- A is fixed at position 4.
- We know L is in the word, but not at position 3.

Also, we have the following absent letters from all guesses:
- C (absent, G1)
- R (absent, G1)
- N (absent, G1)
- S (absent, G2)
- T (absent, G2)
- D (absent, G2)
- B (absent, G3)
- Y (absent, G3)

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y.

We also have E and A fixed.

The word pattern so far:
Position 1: unknown (but cannot be any absent letter)
Position 2: E (fixed)
Position 3: unknown (but not L? because L is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere? However, L is present so must be in position 1 or 5? Since position 3 is not L and positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
Position 4: A (fixed)
Position 5: unknown (but cannot be absent letters)

Now, L is present and not in position 3. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, L must be in either position 1 or position 5? Because those are the only positions left.

Word structure: _ E _ A _ 
We have to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

We know L is one of the missing letters and must be in position 1 or 5? Because position 3 is available but L cannot be at position 3 according to BELAY feedback? The '-' for L in position 3 means L is in the word but not at position 3. So yes, L must be at position 1 or 5.

Additionally, we have one more letter to find (since there are three positions: 1,3,5 and one of them is L? Not necessarily: L is one letter, but the other two positions are another letter? Or possibly duplicate? But we have no indication so far.

So, let the letters to find: let position 1, 3, and 5 be filled with letters that are not absent.

Available letters: we've ruled out C,R,N,S,T,D,B,Y.

So available: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? (and A and E are already used? But we don't know about duplicates. However, since L is already accounted for, and the word might have another L? But we have L only once so far? The word may have duplicates, but not indicated? We'll assume no duplicates unless needed? But we have to consider possibilities.

But L is present, so if L is at position 1 or 5, that's one position. The other two positions must be two new letters? Or one of them could be L? No, because L is one letter, and if we put L at position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L unless there are duplicate Ls? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for BELAY showed only one L? We haven't seen any indication of duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore:
- L must be in either position 1 or position 5.
- The other two positions: one letter for position 3 and one for the remaining position (1 or 5) and they must be from the available letters, excluding L? Because if L is in position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L? Similarly if L is in position 5, then positions 1 and 3 cannot be L? So the letters are distinct: two more letters besides L? Actually, we have three positions but only one L? So positions 1,3,5: one of them is L, and the other two are two other distinct letters from the available set.

So available letters excluding L: F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. (and we have 16 letters? But that's too many.)

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: _ E _ A _ 
With the first blank being either L or one of the other available letters? But L must fill one of the blanks in position 1 or 5.

Two scenarios:

Scenario A: L in position 1 -> word: L E _ A _ 
Then we need to fill position 3 and 5 with two letters from available (F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z). 

Scenario B: L in position 5 -> word: _ E _ A L 
Then we need to fill position 1 and 3 with two letters from available set (same as above).

We can try to guess a word that tests one scenario.

But we also know from the first guess: A was present but not at position 3. But A is now fixed at position 4? So that doesn't affect position 3 now. The A information is already used.

Also, we need to consider common words.

Let's think of words that fit:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _ 
The word must be L E ? A ? 
Possible words: 
  L E A K ? -> but absent letters? L E A K Y? No, Y absent. And K? But we need to fill position 5? LEAK is 4 letters? So not.
  L E G A L? But position 3: G, position 5: L -> duplicate L? And we have LEGAL? But we are assuming no duplicates? Alternatively, LEGAL has two Ls? So we cannot assume no duplicates? We have to consider it? But in this case, we know L is present? But in BELAY we had L at position 3 and now we are putting L at position 1? But the word LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? And we know L is present? Then in the feedback, for BELAY we had only one L? But if the word has L in multiple positions, and we guess only one? So it might not show? I'm confused.

To avoid complexity, let's try to think of words without duplicates first? But let's list.

Alternative: maybe L can be in position 3? But no, BELAY feedback: L at position 3 was wrong? So L is not in position 3. Therefore, for the current pattern, position 3 cannot be L.

So Scenario A and B are the options.

Let me search for words:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _
- L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
- L E V A ? -> LEVA? Not. 
- L E G A ? -> LEGA? Not. 
- L E M A L? But that's 5 if LEMAL? Not a word. 
- L E T A ? -> T absent? T is absent? 
- L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not a word? 
- LEGAL? But LEGAL: L E G A L -> position 5: L? Duplicate L? And word? Yes? And it has L at position 1 and L at position 5? We don't know? We can try? But we might get feedback for two Ls? However, in our guess BELAY we had only one L? So we don't know? So we can try LEGAL? But position 3: G? And available? Yes.

For Scenario B: _ E _ A L
- Words: ? E ? A L
- Examples: V E X A L? Not a word. 
- R E A L L? But R absent? 
- F E L L A? But L duplicate? And F E L L A -> positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4)? But position 4 is A? So not. 
- B E Z A L? Not. 
- G E M A L? Not a word? 
- H E M A L? HEMAL is a word? Yes? H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5). This fits? And H, M available? Yes. 
- M E T A L? T absent? 
- P E P A L? PEPAL? Not a word? 
- V E A L? VEAL is 4? 
- J E W A L? JEWEL with A? Not? J E W A L? Not a word? 
- K E P A L? Not. 
- D E V A L? D absent? and V? 
- L E V E L? But E duplicate? And A not at position 4. 

So from Scenario B, we have ""HEMAL"" which is a word? Meaning relating to the blood.

Also, in Scenario A, ""LEGAL"" is a word.

But LEGAL has L at position 1 and L at position 5? So if we guess LEGAL, and the word has only one L? Then we'll get L in position 1 maybe '-' and position 5 'x'? Or vice versa? But that's messy? We'll see.

But we also know that the word must have only one L? Or we don't know? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we need to test.

But we have two potential words: LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL uses H, M, L.

We have another clue: from the first guess, E was present but not in position 5? But now E is at position 2? So that doesn't help.

We also have position 3: from BELAY, we put L at position 3 and it was wrong. So position 3 might be any available letter.

To decide between Scenario A and B? We don't know? We can try a word that potentially fits one scenario? And test more common letters? 

But let's see available letters: many? We need to narrow down.

Another idea: we have to test a new set of letters? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try one.

Let me suggest guessing ""LEGAL""? Because it tests the scenario A? And includes G, which is common? And if it's wrong, we'll know more? But LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? If the word has only one L? Then one of them might be correct? Or both wrong? But we know L is present? So at least one L should be marked '-' or '✓'? But not both 'x'? Unless the L is in position 3? But we know it's not? So at least one L would be marked '-'?

But if we guess LEGAL: L E G A L? Feedback? 

But position 2 E is fixed, position 4 A is fixed? So we'll get feedback for position 1 L, position 3 G, position 5 L.

If the word has L in position 1: then L at position 1: if correct, we get ✓, else if wrong, we get -? But position 1 is L? And if L is at position 1, then ✓? Or if not, then -? And if L is in position 5? Then for position 5: ✓? But we'll see.

The problem is that if the word has L in position 5, then position 1 L would be '-' because it's not there? But duplicate? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses L only once? And tests more letters? Because if we guess LEGAL, it has two Ls? Maybe not efficient? We should test L only in one position to avoid confusion.

So better to test Scenario A with L at position 1 and a new letter at position 3 and 5? Or Scenario B with L at position 5 and new at position 1 and 3.

But if we test Scenario A: L E ? A ? 
Then we need to choose a word that fills position 3 and 5 with new letters?

Similarly for Scenario B.

But we don't have much to go on.

We know from the first guess that A was in the word? But we used that? Also, E in the word? Fixed.

Another common letter? We can try to fill with vowels? But we have O, I, U, etc.

Let's list quick words:

For L E _ A _ : 
  LEV?A -> not? 
  LEF?A -> LEFTA? T absent? 
  LEG?A -> LEGUA? Not.
  LEHA? LEHGA? Not a word? 
  LEI?A -> LEI A? Not.
  LEK?A -> not? 
  LEM?A LEM A? -> not. 
  LEP?A -> LEP A? Not.
  LEQ?A -> not.
  LEU?A LEUMA? Not? 
  LEV?A LEV A? -> LEVAN? Not? 
  LEW?A LEW A? Not.
  LEX?A LEX A? -> LEXIA? L E X I A? But I at position 5? The word would be L E X I A? Positions: L(1) E(2) X(3) I(4)? Wait, position 4 is A? So it must be L E X ? A ? -> L E X A ? -> LEXA? Not 5. 

For the other scenario: _ E _ A L
We have HEMAL? Which is a word? H E M A L -> meaning relating to the blood? Also, JEMAL? Not a word? FEMAL? Not? GEMAL? Not? 

Another word: V E X A L? Not a word? 
P E C A L? C absent? 
P E K A L? PEKAL? Not? 
P E P A L? Not? 
P E Z A L? Not? 
W E B A L? Not? 
X E B A L? Not? 

So only HEMAL is a clear word.

What about ""METAL""? Not? T absent? 

""PEDAL""? D absent? 

""VENAL""? V E N A L? N absent? 

""MEDIA""? M E D I A? D absent? 

""REALM""? R E A L M? R absent? 

So HEMAL is a valid option? Or LEGAL? Or maybe ""KOALA""? But K O A L A? No E? We have E fixed at position 2? So not.

Wait, another word for Scenario B: ""VELLAL""? Not a word? 

Or ""CELLAR""? But C and R absent? 

I think the only common words are LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL is less common.

Perhaps ""FECAL""? But C absent.

Another word: ""FEIAL""? Not a word? 

We might have to use LEGAL or HEMAL? But let's choose HEMAL because it tests H and M and has L only at position 5? So no duplicate L? So we can avoid duplication issue.

HEMAL: H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5)? So L at position 5. If the word has L at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? And if not, a '-'? But we know L is present? So if L is at position 5, it's the correct position? Otherwise, if L is at position 1, in HEMAL we have no L at position 1? So we'll get feedback for L at position 5: if it's not position 5, then '-'? But since we have L only once in the guess, then we'll know L is not at position 5? Then L must be at position 1? And then for position 5, we have L in HEMAL? So it might not match.

But if we want to test if L is at position 5, we can use HEMAL? Because it puts L in position 5. If we get L correct at position 5, great? If we get L present but in wrong position? That must mean L is at position 1? Because position 3 is not possible? And position 2 and 4 are fixed? So for the real word, L can only be at position 1 or 5? So if we put L at position 5 and it's not correct, we'll get a '-'? Then we know L is at position 1? So we can infer.

Therefore, guessing HEMAL will give us:

- If L is at position 5: then we get L(✓) at position 5? And also, M at position 3 and H at position 1? 
- If L is not at position 5: then we get L(-) meaning L is in another position? But we only have position 1 left? So it should be at position 1? And then position 5 is something else? But in HEMAL, position 5 is L? So the feedback will mark that L as '-'? And then we know L must be at position 1?

So yes, we'll get clear feedback.

Similarly, for the other letters: H at position 1, M at position 3.

We also test for the presence of H and M? We don't know about them yet.

So HEMAL is a good guess? Even though HEMAL is a medical term? But it's in English? Yes.

Alternative: we could try a different word? But we don't have many options.

We could try for Scenario A a word like ""LEM?A""? No word? 

Another word: ""PEAL""? Too short?  

Or ""LEVEL""? But E duplicate? 

I think HEMAL is acceptable.

So let's go with HEMAL.

Guess: H E M A L

But we have to write a word? So ""HEMAL"" is the word.

<guess>hemal</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the previous feedback:

1. **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y (marked ""x"" in past guesses: C, R, N from Guess 1; S, T, D from Guess 2; B, Y from Guess 3).
2. **Confirmed Fixed Positions:**
   - **Position 2: E (✓)** confirmed by Guess 3 (""belay"").
   - **Position 4: A (✓)** confirmed by Guess 2 (""stead"").
3. **Present Letters with Restrictions:**
   - **L (-):** Present in the word, but not in position 3 (per Guess 3 feedback).
   - **E (-):** Position 3 is invalid (per Guess 2 feedback) and position 5 is invalid (per Guess 1 feedback). Since position 2 is confirmed E, no further E positions need testing.
4. **Word Structure:**  
   The word follows: **[Pos1] E [Pos3] A [Pos5]**:
   - **Pos1:** Must contain a new letter or L (since L cannot be in position 3, and positions 2/4 are fixed, L must be in position 1 or 5).
   - **Pos3:** Any available letter except absent ones and L (L not allowed here).
   - **Pos5:** Must contain a new letter or L (if L is not in position 1).
   - **Available letters:** F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding known absent letters).
5. **Guessing Strategy:**
   - Test ""HEMAL"" to:
     - Put **L in position 5** to check if it matches the correct position. If L is ""x"" or ""-"", we can deduce L must be in position 1.
     - Test new letters **H (position 1)** and **M (position 3)**.
   - ""HEMAL"" (meaning ""relating to the blood"") fits the pattern and uses common rules for narrowing down possibilities.",Guess 4: hemal -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
 Word: C R A N E
 Feedback: x, x, -, x, -
 Meaning:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)
   N: not in the word (x)
   E: in the word but in the wrong position (-)

 So we know:
   The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (since we had it in the 3rd and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   The word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since we had it at the end and got '-', meaning wrong position).
   Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We must avoid using C, R, N in our next guess.

 Since A and E are in the word, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

 Now, let's think about positions:
   We put A in position 3 and E in position 5 and both were wrong. So A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.

 We should try to place A and E in other positions.

 Common vowels: A, E (we already have these) and other vowels are I, O, U (but sometimes Y). We might try to include other vowels to test.

 But since we only have two confirmed letters (A and E), we should try a word that has A and E, and avoid C, R, N.

 Also, we can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me think of a word that:
   - Doesn't contain C, R, N
   - Contains A and E (and we'll put them in positions that are not 3 and 5 from the first guess, respectively)

 Possible positions for A: can be 1, 2, 4? Because it was in 3 and was wrong.
 Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.

 So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.

 Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.

 Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.

 Possible words: 
   SAUTE? S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S in 1, A in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 and we were told E is not in position 5? Actually the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can try E in position 5 again? No, because we know it's not at position 5? Actually, no: the '-' means it's in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don't know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.

 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there's an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn't get a ✓ only because we didn't have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.

 So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven't tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.

 Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.

 So for our next word, let's try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).

 I'll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.

 Example: 
   Let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".

 Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn't test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn't have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven't tested S, T, L, etc.

 Let me choose a word that includes S and T.

 Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn't a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. 
   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.

 But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let's check:
   S: new
   L: new
   A: we know A is in the word
   T: new
   E: we know E is in the word

 And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? 
   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let's rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.

 We know A can't be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again.

 Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.

 Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? 
   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.
   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.

 Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.

 So STEAD:
   S is at 1
   T is at 2
   E is at 3 (we don't know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)
   A is at 4 (new for A, didn't try position 4 before)
   D is at 5

 This way we test:
   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn't been tested for E)
   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)

 Also, we test S, T, D.

 I think this is a good candidate.

 Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn't A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.

 Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we'll get a '-'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don't get new information? We should avoid that.

 And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don't know about T? It's acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.

 So I choose STEAD.

<guess>stead</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they're in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).
- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.
- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.

A suitable word is **""STEAD""**:
- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  
  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.

<guess>stead</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not in position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)
- D: x (absent)

So what we know:
- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).
- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it's not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

Also, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.

We have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don't know.

The word has 5 letters. We know:
- Position 4: A
- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.
- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don't know about duplicates? But we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)

But note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let's assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the word has: 
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.

We also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).

Now, we need to think of words that have:
- Position 4: A
- E in position 1 or 2.
- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.

We can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it's wrong, we'll know E is in position 2.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.

But we also need to test the other positions.

Let me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.

First, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ 
We need to fill positions 2,3,5.

If E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _

We can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a '-' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it's not the correct position, we would get a '-' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don't get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let me list possible words:

Option 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _
Examples: 
  E L U L A? Not 5. 
  E C H O A? But C is absent. 
  E G G A R? R absent. 
  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know. 
  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. 
  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.

We must avoid S.

So let's think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.

Available: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words: 
  E L B O A? Not a word.
  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.
  E M B A R? R absent.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don't know, but let's avoid duplicates for now.

This is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _
Examples: 
  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _

So: 
  Position 1: some letter
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: some letter
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: some letter

And we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that's fine.

Common words: 
  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? 
  But let's check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that's L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.

We need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.

Examples: 
  B E L A H? Not a word.
  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be A. So:

  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: E
  Position 3: ?
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: ?

Words: 
  P E B A K? Not a word.
  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? 
  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.

  B E T A S? S absent.
  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

T is absent, so we cannot use T.

  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.

  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.

But let's think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words: 
  E C H A O? C absent.
  E L U A ? -> not 5.
  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? 
  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. 
  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.

  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.

  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.

We need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.

  E L M I A? Not a word.

  E P O A K? Not a word.

This is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn't have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it's fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it's fixed.

So in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.

So the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _

And we know E is in position 1 or 2.

So we have two cases:

Case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
Case 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)

Let's try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _

Possible words:
  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.

  G E M A L? Not a word.

  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.

  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.

  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.

  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It's a dish. But let's check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.

  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.

  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.

  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  B E Z A L? Not a word.

  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.

  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That's not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.

  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.

  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.

  Q E P A ? -> not a word.

  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.

  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.

So from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.

BELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y
PELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U

Both have E in position 2 and L in position 3.

Now, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _

Words:
  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.
  E C A ? -> not.
  E F A ? -> not.
  E G A ? -> not.
  E H A ? -> not.
  E J A ? -> not.
  E K A ? -> not.
  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.
  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.
  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.
  E Q A ? -> not.
  E U O A ? -> not.
  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.
  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.
  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.
  E Z A ? -> not.

  E L U L A? Not 5.

  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.

  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.

  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.

  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.

  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.

  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.

  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.

  E X P O A? Not 5.

So I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it's more likely that E is in position 2.

So we can try either BELAY or PELAU.

But we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.

BELAY has B, L, Y.
PELAU has P, L, U.

Both have L in position 3. We don't know if L is in the word.

We can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.

I think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don't have many common letters left.

Another word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.

Or ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.

Another idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got '-', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.

So WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for E.

Therefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn't find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.

Let me try to find more words for case 2.

What about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.

""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.

""VELA"" is 4 letters.

""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.

""PEDAL""? D absent.

""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it's a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. Also, we haven't tested L, G.

But in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don't know if L is in the word.

But we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it's a valid word.

But let's see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x's? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don't know.

But we have to choose a word.

Another word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.

""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.

I think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.

I'll go with BELAY.

So guess: BELAY

But let's confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y

We have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.

If E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word for position 1, so if BELAY fails for E, we might have to try a different word for position 1? But we'll see.

So I'll guess BELAY.

<guess>belay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A is confirmed in position 4** (from Guess 2: ""stead"" had A(✓)).
- **E is present** but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: E(-) in position 3) or position 5 (from Guess 1: E(-) in position 5). Since position 4 is occupied by A, E must be in position 1 or 2.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, D (from Guess 1 and 2 feedback).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters and confirmed A/E).

Given this, the next guess should:
- Place **A in position 4** (confirmed).
- Test **E in position 2** (since no valid words with E in position 1 were found, and position 3/5 are invalid for E).
- Test new common consonants (e.g., B, L, Y) to gather more information.
- Avoid absent letters and duplicates (for efficiency).

The word **""BELAY""** fits these criteria:
- **B** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.
- **E** (position 2): Tests E in a valid candidate position.
- **L** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.
- **A** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.
- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.

If E is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm E must be in position 1 for future guesses. This maximizes information gain.

<guess>belay</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)
Guess 3: belay -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) A(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- N: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5 was wrong]

Guess 2: STEAD
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- D: absent (x)

Guess 3: BELAY
- B: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) [position 2 is E]
- L: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]
- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]
- Y: absent (x)

Summary of what we know now:

- Position 2: E is correct (from BELAY: E✓)
- Position 4: A is correct (from STEAD and BELAY: A✓)
- E is in position 2, which we just confirmed.

Now, from BELAY feedback:
- L is present but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for L at position 3).

Also, from previous feedback:
- E is now confirmed at position 2, so the E in the word is fixed at position 2.
- A is fixed at position 4.
- We know L is in the word, but not at position 3.

Also, we have the following absent letters from all guesses:
- C (absent, G1)
- R (absent, G1)
- N (absent, G1)
- S (absent, G2)
- T (absent, G2)
- D (absent, G2)
- B (absent, G3)
- Y (absent, G3)

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y.

We also have E and A fixed.

The word pattern so far:
Position 1: unknown (but cannot be any absent letter)
Position 2: E (fixed)
Position 3: unknown (but not L? because L is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere? However, L is present so must be in position 1 or 5? Since position 3 is not L and positions 2 and 4 are fixed).
Position 4: A (fixed)
Position 5: unknown (but cannot be absent letters)

Now, L is present and not in position 3. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, L must be in either position 1 or position 5? Because those are the only positions left.

Word structure: _ E _ A _ 
We have to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.

We know L is one of the missing letters and must be in position 1 or 5? Because position 3 is available but L cannot be at position 3 according to BELAY feedback? The '-' for L in position 3 means L is in the word but not at position 3. So yes, L must be at position 1 or 5.

Additionally, we have one more letter to find (since there are three positions: 1,3,5 and one of them is L? Not necessarily: L is one letter, but the other two positions are another letter? Or possibly duplicate? But we have no indication so far.

So, let the letters to find: let position 1, 3, and 5 be filled with letters that are not absent.

Available letters: we've ruled out C,R,N,S,T,D,B,Y.

So available: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? (and A and E are already used? But we don't know about duplicates. However, since L is already accounted for, and the word might have another L? But we have L only once so far? The word may have duplicates, but not indicated? We'll assume no duplicates unless needed? But we have to consider possibilities.

But L is present, so if L is at position 1 or 5, that's one position. The other two positions must be two new letters? Or one of them could be L? No, because L is one letter, and if we put L at position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L unless there are duplicate Ls? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for BELAY showed only one L? We haven't seen any indication of duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? We'll assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore:
- L must be in either position 1 or position 5.
- The other two positions: one letter for position 3 and one for the remaining position (1 or 5) and they must be from the available letters, excluding L? Because if L is in position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L? Similarly if L is in position 5, then positions 1 and 3 cannot be L? So the letters are distinct: two more letters besides L? Actually, we have three positions but only one L? So positions 1,3,5: one of them is L, and the other two are two other distinct letters from the available set.

So available letters excluding L: F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. (and we have 16 letters? But that's too many.)

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: _ E _ A _ 
With the first blank being either L or one of the other available letters? But L must fill one of the blanks in position 1 or 5.

Two scenarios:

Scenario A: L in position 1 -> word: L E _ A _ 
Then we need to fill position 3 and 5 with two letters from available (F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z). 

Scenario B: L in position 5 -> word: _ E _ A L 
Then we need to fill position 1 and 3 with two letters from available set (same as above).

We can try to guess a word that tests one scenario.

But we also know from the first guess: A was present but not at position 3. But A is now fixed at position 4? So that doesn't affect position 3 now. The A information is already used.

Also, we need to consider common words.

Let's think of words that fit:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _ 
The word must be L E ? A ? 
Possible words: 
  L E A K ? -> but absent letters? L E A K Y? No, Y absent. And K? But we need to fill position 5? LEAK is 4 letters? So not.
  L E G A L? But position 3: G, position 5: L -> duplicate L? And we have LEGAL? But we are assuming no duplicates? Alternatively, LEGAL has two Ls? So we cannot assume no duplicates? We have to consider it? But in this case, we know L is present? But in BELAY we had L at position 3 and now we are putting L at position 1? But the word LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? And we know L is present? Then in the feedback, for BELAY we had only one L? But if the word has L in multiple positions, and we guess only one? So it might not show? I'm confused.

To avoid complexity, let's try to think of words without duplicates first? But let's list.

Alternative: maybe L can be in position 3? But no, BELAY feedback: L at position 3 was wrong? So L is not in position 3. Therefore, for the current pattern, position 3 cannot be L.

So Scenario A and B are the options.

Let me search for words:

For Scenario A: L E _ A _
- L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. 
- L E V A ? -> LEVA? Not. 
- L E G A ? -> LEGA? Not. 
- L E M A L? But that's 5 if LEMAL? Not a word. 
- L E T A ? -> T absent? T is absent? 
- L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not a word? 
- LEGAL? But LEGAL: L E G A L -> position 5: L? Duplicate L? And word? Yes? And it has L at position 1 and L at position 5? We don't know? We can try? But we might get feedback for two Ls? However, in our guess BELAY we had only one L? So we don't know? So we can try LEGAL? But position 3: G? And available? Yes.

For Scenario B: _ E _ A L
- Words: ? E ? A L
- Examples: V E X A L? Not a word. 
- R E A L L? But R absent? 
- F E L L A? But L duplicate? And F E L L A -> positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4)? But position 4 is A? So not. 
- B E Z A L? Not. 
- G E M A L? Not a word? 
- H E M A L? HEMAL is a word? Yes? H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5). This fits? And H, M available? Yes. 
- M E T A L? T absent? 
- P E P A L? PEPAL? Not a word? 
- V E A L? VEAL is 4? 
- J E W A L? JEWEL with A? Not? J E W A L? Not a word? 
- K E P A L? Not. 
- D E V A L? D absent? and V? 
- L E V E L? But E duplicate? And A not at position 4. 

So from Scenario B, we have ""HEMAL"" which is a word? Meaning relating to the blood.

Also, in Scenario A, ""LEGAL"" is a word.

But LEGAL has L at position 1 and L at position 5? So if we guess LEGAL, and the word has only one L? Then we'll get L in position 1 maybe '-' and position 5 'x'? Or vice versa? But that's messy? We'll see.

But we also know that the word must have only one L? Or we don't know? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we need to test.

But we have two potential words: LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL uses H, M, L.

We have another clue: from the first guess, E was present but not in position 5? But now E is at position 2? So that doesn't help.

We also have position 3: from BELAY, we put L at position 3 and it was wrong. So position 3 might be any available letter.

To decide between Scenario A and B? We don't know? We can try a word that potentially fits one scenario? And test more common letters? 

But let's see available letters: many? We need to narrow down.

Another idea: we have to test a new set of letters? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try one.

Let me suggest guessing ""LEGAL""? Because it tests the scenario A? And includes G, which is common? And if it's wrong, we'll know more? But LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? If the word has only one L? Then one of them might be correct? Or both wrong? But we know L is present? So at least one L should be marked '-' or '✓'? But not both 'x'? Unless the L is in position 3? But we know it's not? So at least one L would be marked '-'?

But if we guess LEGAL: L E G A L? Feedback? 

But position 2 E is fixed, position 4 A is fixed? So we'll get feedback for position 1 L, position 3 G, position 5 L.

If the word has L in position 1: then L at position 1: if correct, we get ✓, else if wrong, we get -? But position 1 is L? And if L is at position 1, then ✓? Or if not, then -? And if L is in position 5? Then for position 5: ✓? But we'll see.

The problem is that if the word has L in position 5, then position 1 L would be '-' because it's not there? But duplicate? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses L only once? And tests more letters? Because if we guess LEGAL, it has two Ls? Maybe not efficient? We should test L only in one position to avoid confusion.

So better to test Scenario A with L at position 1 and a new letter at position 3 and 5? Or Scenario B with L at position 5 and new at position 1 and 3.

But if we test Scenario A: L E ? A ? 
Then we need to choose a word that fills position 3 and 5 with new letters?

Similarly for Scenario B.

But we don't have much to go on.

We know from the first guess that A was in the word? But we used that? Also, E in the word? Fixed.

Another common letter? We can try to fill with vowels? But we have O, I, U, etc.

Let's list quick words:

For L E _ A _ : 
  LEV?A -> not? 
  LEF?A -> LEFTA? T absent? 
  LEG?A -> LEGUA? Not.
  LEHA? LEHGA? Not a word? 
  LEI?A -> LEI A? Not.
  LEK?A -> not? 
  LEM?A LEM A? -> not. 
  LEP?A -> LEP A? Not.
  LEQ?A -> not.
  LEU?A LEUMA? Not? 
  LEV?A LEV A? -> LEVAN? Not? 
  LEW?A LEW A? Not.
  LEX?A LEX A? -> LEXIA? L E X I A? But I at position 5? The word would be L E X I A? Positions: L(1) E(2) X(3) I(4)? Wait, position 4 is A? So it must be L E X ? A ? -> L E X A ? -> LEXA? Not 5. 

For the other scenario: _ E _ A L
We have HEMAL? Which is a word? H E M A L -> meaning relating to the blood? Also, JEMAL? Not a word? FEMAL? Not? GEMAL? Not? 

Another word: V E X A L? Not a word? 
P E C A L? C absent? 
P E K A L? PEKAL? Not? 
P E P A L? Not? 
P E Z A L? Not? 
W E B A L? Not? 
X E B A L? Not? 

So only HEMAL is a clear word.

What about ""METAL""? Not? T absent? 

""PEDAL""? D absent? 

""VENAL""? V E N A L? N absent? 

""MEDIA""? M E D I A? D absent? 

""REALM""? R E A L M? R absent? 

So HEMAL is a valid option? Or LEGAL? Or maybe ""KOALA""? But K O A L A? No E? We have E fixed at position 2? So not.

Wait, another word for Scenario B: ""VELLAL""? Not a word? 

Or ""CELLAR""? But C and R absent? 

I think the only common words are LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL is less common.

Perhaps ""FECAL""? But C absent.

Another word: ""FEIAL""? Not a word? 

We might have to use LEGAL or HEMAL? But let's choose HEMAL because it tests H and M and has L only at position 5? So no duplicate L? So we can avoid duplication issue.

HEMAL: H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5)? So L at position 5. If the word has L at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? And if not, a '-'? But we know L is present? So if L is at position 5, it's the correct position? Otherwise, if L is at position 1, in HEMAL we have no L at position 1? So we'll get feedback for L at position 5: if it's not position 5, then '-'? But since we have L only once in the guess, then we'll know L is not at position 5? Then L must be at position 1? And then for position 5, we have L in HEMAL? So it might not match.

But if we want to test if L is at position 5, we can use HEMAL? Because it puts L in position 5. If we get L correct at position 5, great? If we get L present but in wrong position? That must mean L is at position 1? Because position 3 is not possible? And position 2 and 4 are fixed? So for the real word, L can only be at position 1 or 5? So if we put L at position 5 and it's not correct, we'll get a '-'? Then we know L is at position 1? So we can infer.

Therefore, guessing HEMAL will give us:

- If L is at position 5: then we get L(✓) at position 5? And also, M at position 3 and H at position 1? 
- If L is not at position 5: then we get L(-) meaning L is in another position? But we only have position 1 left? So it should be at position 1? And then position 5 is something else? But in HEMAL, position 5 is L? So the feedback will mark that L as '-'? And then we know L must be at position 1?

So yes, we'll get clear feedback.

Similarly, for the other letters: H at position 1, M at position 3.

We also test for the presence of H and M? We don't know about them yet.

So HEMAL is a good guess? Even though HEMAL is a medical term? But it's in English? Yes.

Alternative: we could try a different word? But we don't have many options.

We could try for Scenario A a word like ""LEM?A""? No word? 

Another word: ""PEAL""? Too short?  

Or ""LEVEL""? But E duplicate? 

I think HEMAL is acceptable.

So let's go with HEMAL.

Guess: H E M A L

But we have to write a word? So ""HEMAL"" is the word.

<guess>hemal</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Based on the previous feedback:

1. **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y (marked ""x"" in past guesses: C, R, N from Guess 1; S, T, D from Guess 2; B, Y from Guess 3).
2. **Confirmed Fixed Positions:**
   - **Position 2: E (✓)** confirmed by Guess 3 (""belay"").
   - **Position 4: A (✓)** confirmed by Guess 2 (""stead"").
3. **Present Letters with Restrictions:**
   - **L (-):** Present in the word, but not in position 3 (per Guess 3 feedback).
   - **E (-):** Position 3 is invalid (per Guess 2 feedback) and position 5 is invalid (per Guess 1 feedback). Since position 2 is confirmed E, no further E positions need testing.
4. **Word Structure:**  
   The word follows: **[Pos1] E [Pos3] A [Pos5]**:
   - **Pos1:** Must contain a new letter or L (since L cannot be in position 3, and positions 2/4 are fixed, L must be in position 1 or 5).
   - **Pos3:** Any available letter except absent ones and L (L not allowed here).
   - **Pos5:** Must contain a new letter or L (if L is not in position 1).
   - **Available letters:** F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding known absent letters).
5. **Guessing Strategy:**
   - Test ""HEMAL"" to:
     - Put **L in position 5** to check if it matches the correct position. If L is ""x"" or ""-"", we can deduce L must be in position 1.
     - Test new letters **H (position 1)** and **M (position 3)**.
   - ""HEMAL"" (meaning ""relating to the blood"") fits the pattern and uses common rules for narrowing down possibilities.

It covers common consonants and two vowels (A and E).\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess:\n Word: C R A N E\n Feedback: x, x, -, x, -\n Meaning:\n   C: not in the word (x)\n   R: not in the word (x)\n   A: in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n   N: not in the word (x)\n   E: in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n\n So we know:\n   The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position (since we had it in the 3rd and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   The word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since we had it at the end and got \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   Letters C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, N in our next guess.\n\n Since A and E are in the word, we should include them again, but in different positions.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.\n\n Now, let\'s think about positions:\n   We put A in position 3 and E in position 5 and both were wrong. So A cannot be at position 3 and E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We should try to place A and E in other positions.\n\n Common vowels: A, E (we already have these) and other vowels are I, O, U (but sometimes Y). We might try to include other vowels to test.\n\n But since we only have two confirmed letters (A and E), we should try a word that has A and E, and avoid C, R, N.\n\n Also, we can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let me think of a word that:\n   - Doesn\'t contain C, R, N\n   - Contains A and E (and we\'ll put them in positions that are not 3 and 5 from the first guess, respectively)\n\n Possible positions for A: can be 1, 2, 4? Because it was in 3 and was wrong.\n Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4?\n\n Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us where they are, only that they are not in the position we guessed.\n\n So we should try A in a new position and E in a new position.\n\n Example: put A in the 1st position and E in the 2nd? Or A in the 2nd and E in the 4th? Anywhere except their previously tried positions.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and E and no C, R, N.\n\n Possible words: \n   SAUTE? S, A, U, T, E -> positions: S in 1, A in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 and we were told E is not in position 5? Actually the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can try E in position 5 again? No, because we know it\'s not at position 5? Actually, no: the \'-\' means it\'s in the word but not in that position. So E might be in positions 1,2,3,4? But we don\'t know. However, since we tried position 5 and it was wrong, we should avoid putting E at the 5th again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to get more information.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be in position 3? But it might be in 3 if there are multiple A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, since we only had one A and it was marked as in the word but wrong position, we assume there\'s an A somewhere else. But it could be that the word has an A in position 3 and we didn\'t get a ✓ only because we didn\'t have enough information? No, if the A were in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓. So we know for sure position 3 is not A.\n\n So we should try A in positions 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, we haven\'t tried A in position 5? Actually, we had E in position 5, not A. So A could be anywhere except 3.\n\n Similarly, E could be anywhere except 5? But that was from guess 1. Actually, we tried E in the 5th and it was wrong, so we know E is not at the end. But it might be in other positions.\n\n So for our next word, let\'s try to put A at the beginning or in the middle (but not position 3) and E somewhere in the middle or start (but not position 5).\n\n I\'ll try to pick a word that has A in a different position and E in a different position.\n\n Example: \n   Let\'s put A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be a word like ""A__E_"".\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters. Since we have S left? We had S in ""crane"" but we didn\'t test S? Wait, in the first guess we didn\'t have S. We had C,R,A,N,E. So we haven\'t tested S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that includes S and T.\n\n Consider the word: ""SAFEY""? But ""SAFEY"" isn\'t a word. ""SAFES""? 5 letters? SAFES is a word? Plural form? Maybe not the best. \n   How about ""SLATE""? But we must avoid R? But SLATE has no R? And no C or N? But we do have to consider that R is ruled out.\n\n But wait: SLATE has S, L, A, T, E -> so let\'s check:\n   S: new\n   L: new\n   A: we know A is in the word\n   T: new\n   E: we know E is in the word\n\n And avoid positions where we know A and E are wrong? \n   For A: we are putting it in position 3? But wait, in our first guess we put A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting it again in position 3? That would be bad. So let\'s rearrange: we need to put A in a new position.\n\n We know A can\'t be in position 3? So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So SLATE has A at position 3? Actually: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But position 3 is where we put A and got it wrong last time? So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again.\n\n Therefore, we must not use SLATE? Because it puts A at position 3 and we know that is wrong.\n\n Alternative: how about ""STEAD""? \n   S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) -> avoids A at position 3 and avoids E at position 5? Yes.\n   And letters: S, T, E, A, D -> all okay, no C,R,N.\n\n Let me check if STEAD is a valid English word: yes, it means a position or a place.\n\n So STEAD:\n   S is at 1\n   T is at 2\n   E is at 3 (we don\'t know if E is at position 3? We only know E is at the wrong position in position 5? So position 3 is new for E.)\n   A is at 4 (new for A, didn\'t try position 4 before)\n   D is at 5\n\n This way we test:\n   E: in position 3 (previously we only tried position 5 and it was wrong, so position 3 hasn\'t been tested for E)\n   A: in position 4 (previously tried in position 3 and wrong, so new position)\n\n Also, we test S, T, D.\n\n I think this is a good candidate.\n\n Another option: ""STALE""? But then A is at position 3? We know position 3 isn\'t A? So STALE is bad because A is at position 3.\n\n Another: ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but E at position 5? We know that position 5 is wrong for E? So if we put E at position 5 again, we know we\'ll get a \'-\'? And we already know E is in the word? So we don\'t get new information? We should avoid that.\n\n And also, we have duplicate T? Not the best because we are wasting a position? But we don\'t know about T? It\'s acceptable? But STEAD has unique letters? Better.\n\n So I choose STEAD.\n\n<guess>stead</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **C**, **R**, and **N** are **absent** (marked ""x"")\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"")\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"")\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **E** (since they\'re in the word) but in new positions (not 3 for A, not 5 for E).\n- Exclude **C**, **R**, and **N**.\n- Test new common consonants like **S**, **T**, and **D**.\n\nA suitable word is **""STEAD""**:\n- Positions: **S** (1), **T** (2), **E** (3), **A** (4), **D** (5).  \n  This places **A** in position 4 (new) and **E** in position 3 (not tested before), while introducing **S**, **T**, and **D**.\n\n<guess>stead</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: x (absent)\n- A: - (present, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: STEAD\n- S: x (absent)\n- T: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not in position 3)  [since we put E in position 3 and got \'-\']\n- A: ✓ (correct position! so A is in position 4)\n- D: x (absent)\n\nSo what we know:\n- A is in position 4 (from STEAD: A at position 4 is correct).\n- E is in the word, but not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from STEAD). So E must be in position 1 or 2? (since position 4 is taken by A, and position 5 we know it\'s not). The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know E is not in 3 or 5. And position 4 is A, so E must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, we know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, D.\n\nWe have two positions left to find: positions 1,2,3 and 5? Actually, position 4 is fixed as A. So we need positions 1,2,3,5. But E is in one of 1 or 2? And we have one more letter that we don\'t know.\n\nThe word has 5 letters. We know:\n- Position 4: A\n- E is present and must be in position 1 or 2.\n- The other three positions (if E is in 1, then 2,3,5; if E is in 2, then 1,3,5) must be filled with letters that are not C,R,N,S,T,D and also not A (since A is already placed, and we don\'t know about duplicates? But we haven\'t seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we can\'t be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, without any indication, we might assume no duplicates for now.)\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we only have one A and one E so far. So let\'s assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\nSo the word has: \n- Position 4: A\n- E in position 1 or 2.\n- The remaining three positions: three new letters that are not in {C,R,N,S,T,D} and not A or E.\n\nWe also know that from the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong, so position 3 is not A (which we already know because position 4 is A and no duplicates?).\n\nNow, we need to think of words that have:\n- Position 4: A\n- E in position 1 or 2.\n- The other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D.\n\nSo available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we have two positions to test: we need to find where E is and what the other letters are.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to test both possibilities for E? Or we can try a word that covers common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 left.\n\nWe can try to put E in position 1 and then test some common letters for the other positions? Or put E in position 2 and test.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we might choose a word that has E in position 1 and then other common letters, and if it\'s wrong, we\'ll know E is in position 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in position 2 and then test.\n\nBut we also need to test the other positions.\n\nLet me think of words that have A in position 4 and E in position 1 or 2.\n\nFirst, if E is in position 1: then the word is E _ _ A _ \nWe need to fill positions 2,3,5.\n\nIf E is in position 2: then the word is _ E _ A _\n\nWe can try to cover both possibilities? But that might be hard.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 1 and then if we get feedback that E is not in position 1, then we know it must be in position 2? But wait, we know E is in the word and only positions 1 and 2 are possible? So if we try a word with E in position 1 and we get a \'-\' for E, that would mean E is not in position 1? But that would be inconsistent because we know E must be in 1 or 2? Actually, if we put E in position 1 and it\'s not the correct position, we would get a \'-\' and then we know E must be in position 2? But we don\'t get new information about other letters? We want to maximize information.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 1: words like E _ _ A _\nExamples: \n  E L U L A? Not 5. \n  E C H O A? But C is absent. \n  E G G A R? R absent. \n  E V A D E? But D is absent and we have duplicate E? Not allowed? We don\'t know. \n  E X A M P? But M and P are possible? But position 4 is A? So E X ? A M -> EXAM? But EXAM is 4 letters? We need 5. EXAM is 4. \n  How about ""EXAMS""? But S is absent? S is absent from STEAD feedback.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nSo let\'s think: E _ _ A _ with letters from available set.\n\nAvailable: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nPossible words: \n  E L B O A? Not a word.\n  E L I A L? Not 5? ELIAL? Not a word.\n  E M B A R? R absent.\n  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? We don\'t know, but let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nThis is hard. Maybe E in position 2 is more common?\n\nOption 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _\nExamples: \n  B E A C H? But C is absent and A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So the word must have A in position 4. So the pattern is _ E _ A _\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: some letter\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: some letter\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: some letter\n\nAnd we know position 3 cannot be A (from first guess) and we have A in 4, so that\'s fine.\n\nCommon words: \n  L E A K Y? But K and Y are possible? And L is available? \n  But let\'s check: L E A K Y -> but A is in position 3? We need A in position 4? So that\'s L E A (position3) K Y -> not matching.\n\nWe need A in position 4. So the word must have the fourth letter as A.\n\nExamples: \n  B E L A H? Not a word.\n  H E A R T? But R is absent and A is in position 3? No, HEART: H E A R T -> A is position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A. So:\n\n  Position 1: ?\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 3: ?\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: ?\n\nWords: \n  P E B A K? Not a word.\n  F E L A ? -> F E L A ? -> FELA is not 5 letters? \n  How about ""FELAS""? But S is absent and not 5? FELAS is not a word.\n\n  B E T A S? S absent.\n  M E T A L? M E T A L -> positions: M(1), E(2), T(3), A(4), L(5). T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.\n\nT is absent, so we cannot use T.\n\n  L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. \n  G E M A ? -> GEMA? Not 5.\n\n  How about ""BEVUE""? But that has E in position 2? B E V U E -> but duplicate E? And U? And A is not in position 4? No.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe we should consider that E might be in position 1.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that has A in position 4 and E in position 1: E _ _ A _\n\nWords: \n  E C H A O? C absent.\n  E L U A ? -> not 5.\n  E V A D E? D absent and duplicate E? Not allowed? \n  E X I A ? -> EXI A? Not 5. \n  E X A M P? But P is at position 5? EXAM is 4, so ""EXPAT""? But EXPAT: E X P A T -> A is in position 4? Yes: E(1), X(2), P(3), A(4), T(5). But T is absent? From STEAD, T is absent? So we cannot use T.\n\n  E B O A T? T absent and O? E B O A T -> A in position 4? E(1), B(2), O(3), A(4), T(5). T absent? So no.\n\n  E M A I L? But A is in position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need A in position 4. So the third letter must not be A? And then A at 4.\n\n  E L M I A? Not a word.\n\n  E P O A K? Not a word.\n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe we should try a word that has E in position 1 and also tests other common letters, even if it doesn\'t have A in position 4? But we know A is in position 4, so we must have A in position 4 in the word? Otherwise, we would get a \'-\' for A? But we already know A is in position 4, so we should keep it there to confirm? Or we can move it to test? But we know it\'s fixed? The feedback from STEAD says A is correct at position 4, so we should keep A in position 4 in all subsequent guesses? Because it\'s fixed.\n\nSo in every future guess, we must have A in position 4.\n\nSo the word pattern must be: _ _ _ A _\n\nAnd we know E is in position 1 or 2.\n\nSo we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _\nCase 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding C,R,N,S,T,D)\n\nLet\'s try to find a word for case 2: _ E _ A _\n\nPossible words:\n  B E L A Y? B E L A Y -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5). This is a word (to secure with a rope). And letters: B, L, Y are available? Yes. And no duplicates.\n\n  G E M A L? Not a word.\n\n  H E A L M? But A is in position 3? No, HEALM is not a word? HEALM? No.\n\n  K E B A B? K E B A B -> duplicate B? And B at position 3 and 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates? But let\'s avoid for now.\n\n  L E V A ? -> LEV A? Not 5.\n\n  M E L B A? M E L B A -> M(1), E(2), L(3), B(4), A(5)? But we need A in position 4? Here A is in position 5? No.\n\n  P E L A U? P E L A U -> U at 5? But PELAU is a word? It\'s a dish. But let\'s check: P(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), U(5). Yes, and U is available.\n\n  V E G A N? But N is absent? N is in the absent list.\n\n  W E L A ? -> WELA? Not 5.\n\n  Y E L P A? Y E L P A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n  B E Z A L? Not a word.\n\n  F E L A ? -> FELA? Not 5.\n\n  H E J A B? H E J A B -> J at 3? And B at 5? HIJAB is a word? H I J A B? But we have H E J A B? That\'s not HIJAB. HIJAB has I, not E.\n\n  L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not 5.\n\n  M E W L A? M E W L A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n  P E K A ? -> PEKA? Not 5.\n\n  Q E P A ? -> not a word.\n\n  V E X A ? -> VEXA? Not 5.\n\n  Z E B A ? -> ZEBA? Not a word.\n\nSo from above, ""BELAY"" and ""PELAU"" are options.\n\nBELAY: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y\nPELAU: P E L A U -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:U\n\nBoth have E in position 2 and L in position 3.\n\nNow, for case 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _\n\nWords:\n  E B O A ? -> EBOA? Not 5.\n  E C A ? -> not.\n  E F A ? -> not.\n  E G A ? -> not.\n  E H A ? -> not.\n  E J A ? -> not.\n  E K A ? -> not.\n  E L A ? -> ELA? Not 5, but if we add one more: E L A P ? -> ELAP? Not. E L A P S? S absent.\n  E M A ? -> EMA? Not 5.\n  E P A ? -> EPA? Not.\n  E Q A ? -> not.\n  E U O A ? -> not.\n  E V A ? -> EVA? Not 5.\n  E W A ? -> EWA? Not.\n  E X A ? -> EXA? Not.\n  E Z A ? -> not.\n\n  E L U L A? Not 5.\n\n  E L M A ? -> ELMA? Not 5.\n\n  E L O A ? -> ELOA? Not a word.\n\n  E L Y A ? -> ELYA? Not.\n\n  E M I A ? -> EMIA? Not 5.\n\n  E P O A ? -> EPOA? Not.\n\n  E V O A ? -> EVOA? Not.\n\n  E X P A ? -> EXP A? EXP is 3, so EXPAT? But T absent.\n\n  E X P O A? Not 5.\n\nSo I cannot find a common word for case 1. Therefore, it\'s more likely that E is in position 2.\n\nSo we can try either BELAY or PELAU.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters. We haven\'t tested L, U, Y, P, B, etc.\n\nBELAY has B, L, Y.\nPELAU has P, L, U.\n\nBoth have L in position 3. We don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nWe can choose one that has more common letters? But common letters left: L, O, U, M, P, etc.\n\nI think both are valid. Let me choose BELAY because it has Y which is less common? Or PELAU has U which is less common? We want to test more common ones first? But we don\'t have many common letters left.\n\nAnother word: what about ""MEDAL""? But D is absent? D is absent from STEAD.\n\nOr ""HELLO""? But L is duplicated? And O? And no A in position 4? We must have A in position 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""WHEAL""? But W H E A L -> A in position 4? W(1), H(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). But E is in position 3? But we know E cannot be in position 3? From STEAD, we put E in position 3 and got \'-\', so E is not in position 3. So we cannot put E in position 3.\n\nSo WHEAL is invalid because E is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLEAK"" has E in position 3? B L E A K -> E at 3, which is not allowed? And K at 5? But also, we know E is not in position 3.\n\nSo we must avoid position 3 for E.\n\nTherefore, for case 1 (E in position 1) we didn\'t find a word, and for case 2 we have BELAY and PELAU.\n\nLet me try to find more words for case 2.\n\nWhat about ""JEWEL""? But J E W E L -> duplicate E? And A not present? We must have A in position 4.\n\n""BELGA""? B E L G A -> A in position 5? Not 4.\n\n""VELA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""VELAR""? V E L A R -> but R is absent.\n\n""PEDAL""? D absent.\n\n""LEGAL""? L E G A L -> positions: L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). This has duplicate L? But it\'s a word. And we have L in position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we haven\'t tested L, G.\n\nBut in LEGAL, we have E in position 2, A in position 4, and L at 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nBut we can try LEGAL? However, it has L at position 1 and 5, which might be inefficient? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: if we try LEGAL, and if L is not in the word, we get two x\'s? Or if L is in the word, we might get one - and one x? Or both -? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we have to choose a word.\n\nAnother word: ""PEKOE""? P E K O E -> duplicate E? And A not present.\n\n""BEVAT""? V and T? T absent.\n\nI think BELAY or PELAU are better because they have unique letters.\n\nI\'ll go with BELAY.\n\nSo guess: BELAY\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: B E L A Y -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:A, 5:Y\n\nWe have A in position 4, E in position 2 (which is a candidate), and we test B, L, Y.\n\nIf E is not in position 2, then we know it must be in position 1? But we couldn\'t find a word for position 1, so if BELAY fails for E, we might have to try a different word for position 1? But we\'ll see.\n\nSo I\'ll guess BELAY.\n\n<guess>belay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A is confirmed in position 4** (from Guess 2: ""stead"" had A(✓)).\n- **E is present** but not in position 3 (from Guess 2: E(-) in position 3) or position 5 (from Guess 1: E(-) in position 5). Since position 4 is occupied by A, E must be in position 1 or 2.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, D (from Guess 1 and 2 feedback).\n- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters and confirmed A/E).\n\nGiven this, the next guess should:\n- Place **A in position 4** (confirmed).\n- Test **E in position 2** (since no valid words with E in position 1 were found, and position 3/5 are invalid for E).\n- Test new common consonants (e.g., B, L, Y) to gather more information.\n- Avoid absent letters and duplicates (for efficiency).\n\nThe word **""BELAY""** fits these criteria:\n- **B** (position 1): Tests a new consonant.\n- **E** (position 2): Tests E in a valid candidate position.\n- **L** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.\n- **A** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.\n- **Y** (position 5): Tests a less common letter.\n\nIf E is not in position 2, the feedback will confirm E must be in position 1 for future guesses. This maximizes information gain.\n\n<guess>belay</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: belay -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) A(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 5 was wrong]\n\nGuess 2: STEAD\n- S: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]\n- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]\n- D: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: BELAY\n- B: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) [position 2 is E]\n- L: present, wrong position (-) [position 3 was wrong]\n- A: correct position (✓) [position 4 is A]\n- Y: absent (x)\n\nSummary of what we know now:\n\n- Position 2: E is correct (from BELAY: E✓)\n- Position 4: A is correct (from STEAD and BELAY: A✓)\n- E is in position 2, which we just confirmed.\n\nNow, from BELAY feedback:\n- L is present but not in position 3 (since we got \'-\' for L at position 3).\n\nAlso, from previous feedback:\n- E is now confirmed at position 2, so the E in the word is fixed at position 2.\n- A is fixed at position 4.\n- We know L is in the word, but not at position 3.\n\nAlso, we have the following absent letters from all guesses:\n- C (absent, G1)\n- R (absent, G1)\n- N (absent, G1)\n- S (absent, G2)\n- T (absent, G2)\n- D (absent, G2)\n- B (absent, G3)\n- Y (absent, G3)\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y.\n\nWe also have E and A fixed.\n\nThe word pattern so far:\nPosition 1: unknown (but cannot be any absent letter)\nPosition 2: E (fixed)\nPosition 3: unknown (but not L? because L is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere? However, L is present so must be in position 1 or 5? Since position 3 is not L and positions 2 and 4 are fixed).\nPosition 4: A (fixed)\nPosition 5: unknown (but cannot be absent letters)\n\nNow, L is present and not in position 3. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, L must be in either position 1 or position 5? Because those are the only positions left.\n\nWord structure: _ E _ A _ \nWe have to fill positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nWe know L is one of the missing letters and must be in position 1 or 5? Because position 3 is available but L cannot be at position 3 according to BELAY feedback? The \'-\' for L in position 3 means L is in the word but not at position 3. So yes, L must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we have one more letter to find (since there are three positions: 1,3,5 and one of them is L? Not necessarily: L is one letter, but the other two positions are another letter? Or possibly duplicate? But we have no indication so far.\n\nSo, let the letters to find: let position 1, 3, and 5 be filled with letters that are not absent.\n\nAvailable letters: we\'ve ruled out C,R,N,S,T,D,B,Y.\n\nSo available: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? (and A and E are already used? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, since L is already accounted for, and the word might have another L? But we have L only once so far? The word may have duplicates, but not indicated? We\'ll assume no duplicates unless needed? But we have to consider possibilities.\n\nBut L is present, so if L is at position 1 or 5, that\'s one position. The other two positions must be two new letters? Or one of them could be L? No, because L is one letter, and if we put L at position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L unless there are duplicate Ls? But the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates? Actually, the feedback for BELAY showed only one L? We haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates? So perhaps no duplicates? We\'ll assume no duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore:\n- L must be in either position 1 or position 5.\n- The other two positions: one letter for position 3 and one for the remaining position (1 or 5) and they must be from the available letters, excluding L? Because if L is in position 1, then position 3 and 5 cannot be L? Similarly if L is in position 5, then positions 1 and 3 cannot be L? So the letters are distinct: two more letters besides L? Actually, we have three positions but only one L? So positions 1,3,5: one of them is L, and the other two are two other distinct letters from the available set.\n\nSo available letters excluding L: F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. (and we have 16 letters? But that\'s too many.)\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: _ E _ A _ \nWith the first blank being either L or one of the other available letters? But L must fill one of the blanks in position 1 or 5.\n\nTwo scenarios:\n\nScenario A: L in position 1 -> word: L E _ A _ \nThen we need to fill position 3 and 5 with two letters from available (F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z). \n\nScenario B: L in position 5 -> word: _ E _ A L \nThen we need to fill position 1 and 3 with two letters from available set (same as above).\n\nWe can try to guess a word that tests one scenario.\n\nBut we also know from the first guess: A was present but not at position 3. But A is now fixed at position 4? So that doesn\'t affect position 3 now. The A information is already used.\n\nAlso, we need to consider common words.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n\nFor Scenario A: L E _ A _ \nThe word must be L E ? A ? \nPossible words: \n  L E A K ? -> but absent letters? L E A K Y? No, Y absent. And K? But we need to fill position 5? LEAK is 4 letters? So not.\n  L E G A L? But position 3: G, position 5: L -> duplicate L? And we have LEGAL? But we are assuming no duplicates? Alternatively, LEGAL has two Ls? So we cannot assume no duplicates? We have to consider it? But in this case, we know L is present? But in BELAY we had L at position 3 and now we are putting L at position 1? But the word LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? And we know L is present? Then in the feedback, for BELAY we had only one L? But if the word has L in multiple positions, and we guess only one? So it might not show? I\'m confused.\n\nTo avoid complexity, let\'s try to think of words without duplicates first? But let\'s list.\n\nAlternative: maybe L can be in position 3? But no, BELAY feedback: L at position 3 was wrong? So L is not in position 3. Therefore, for the current pattern, position 3 cannot be L.\n\nSo Scenario A and B are the options.\n\nLet me search for words:\n\nFor Scenario A: L E _ A _\n- L E M A ? -> LEMA? Not 5. \n- L E V A ? -> LEVA? Not. \n- L E G A ? -> LEGA? Not. \n- L E M A L? But that\'s 5 if LEMAL? Not a word. \n- L E T A ? -> T absent? T is absent? \n- L E P A ? -> LEPA? Not a word? \n- LEGAL? But LEGAL: L E G A L -> position 5: L? Duplicate L? And word? Yes? And it has L at position 1 and L at position 5? We don\'t know? We can try? But we might get feedback for two Ls? However, in our guess BELAY we had only one L? So we don\'t know? So we can try LEGAL? But position 3: G? And available? Yes.\n\nFor Scenario B: _ E _ A L\n- Words: ? E ? A L\n- Examples: V E X A L? Not a word. \n- R E A L L? But R absent? \n- F E L L A? But L duplicate? And F E L L A -> positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4)? But position 4 is A? So not. \n- B E Z A L? Not. \n- G E M A L? Not a word? \n- H E M A L? HEMAL is a word? Yes? H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5). This fits? And H, M available? Yes. \n- M E T A L? T absent? \n- P E P A L? PEPAL? Not a word? \n- V E A L? VEAL is 4? \n- J E W A L? JEWEL with A? Not? J E W A L? Not a word? \n- K E P A L? Not. \n- D E V A L? D absent? and V? \n- L E V E L? But E duplicate? And A not at position 4. \n\nSo from Scenario B, we have ""HEMAL"" which is a word? Meaning relating to the blood.\n\nAlso, in Scenario A, ""LEGAL"" is a word.\n\nBut LEGAL has L at position 1 and L at position 5? So if we guess LEGAL, and the word has only one L? Then we\'ll get L in position 1 maybe \'-\' and position 5 \'x\'? Or vice versa? But that\'s messy? We\'ll see.\n\nBut we also know that the word must have only one L? Or we don\'t know? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? So we need to test.\n\nBut we have two potential words: LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL uses H, M, L.\n\nWe have another clue: from the first guess, E was present but not in position 5? But now E is at position 2? So that doesn\'t help.\n\nWe also have position 3: from BELAY, we put L at position 3 and it was wrong. So position 3 might be any available letter.\n\nTo decide between Scenario A and B? We don\'t know? We can try a word that potentially fits one scenario? And test more common letters? \n\nBut let\'s see available letters: many? We need to narrow down.\n\nAnother idea: we have to test a new set of letters? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try one.\n\nLet me suggest guessing ""LEGAL""? Because it tests the scenario A? And includes G, which is common? And if it\'s wrong, we\'ll know more? But LEGAL has L at position 1 and position 5? If the word has only one L? Then one of them might be correct? Or both wrong? But we know L is present? So at least one L should be marked \'-\' or \'✓\'? But not both \'x\'? Unless the L is in position 3? But we know it\'s not? So at least one L would be marked \'-\'?\n\nBut if we guess LEGAL: L E G A L? Feedback? \n\nBut position 2 E is fixed, position 4 A is fixed? So we\'ll get feedback for position 1 L, position 3 G, position 5 L.\n\nIf the word has L in position 1: then L at position 1: if correct, we get ✓, else if wrong, we get -? But position 1 is L? And if L is at position 1, then ✓? Or if not, then -? And if L is in position 5? Then for position 5: ✓? But we\'ll see.\n\nThe problem is that if the word has L in position 5, then position 1 L would be \'-\' because it\'s not there? But duplicate? But we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses L only once? And tests more letters? Because if we guess LEGAL, it has two Ls? Maybe not efficient? We should test L only in one position to avoid confusion.\n\nSo better to test Scenario A with L at position 1 and a new letter at position 3 and 5? Or Scenario B with L at position 5 and new at position 1 and 3.\n\nBut if we test Scenario A: L E ? A ? \nThen we need to choose a word that fills position 3 and 5 with new letters?\n\nSimilarly for Scenario B.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nWe know from the first guess that A was in the word? But we used that? Also, E in the word? Fixed.\n\nAnother common letter? We can try to fill with vowels? But we have O, I, U, etc.\n\nLet\'s list quick words:\n\nFor L E _ A _ : \n  LEV?A -> not? \n  LEF?A -> LEFTA? T absent? \n  LEG?A -> LEGUA? Not.\n  LEHA? LEHGA? Not a word? \n  LEI?A -> LEI A? Not.\n  LEK?A -> not? \n  LEM?A LEM A? -> not. \n  LEP?A -> LEP A? Not.\n  LEQ?A -> not.\n  LEU?A LEUMA? Not? \n  LEV?A LEV A? -> LEVAN? Not? \n  LEW?A LEW A? Not.\n  LEX?A LEX A? -> LEXIA? L E X I A? But I at position 5? The word would be L E X I A? Positions: L(1) E(2) X(3) I(4)? Wait, position 4 is A? So it must be L E X ? A ? -> L E X A ? -> LEXA? Not 5. \n\nFor the other scenario: _ E _ A L\nWe have HEMAL? Which is a word? H E M A L -> meaning relating to the blood? Also, JEMAL? Not a word? FEMAL? Not? GEMAL? Not? \n\nAnother word: V E X A L? Not a word? \nP E C A L? C absent? \nP E K A L? PEKAL? Not? \nP E P A L? Not? \nP E Z A L? Not? \nW E B A L? Not? \nX E B A L? Not? \n\nSo only HEMAL is a clear word.\n\nWhat about ""METAL""? Not? T absent? \n\n""PEDAL""? D absent? \n\n""VENAL""? V E N A L? N absent? \n\n""MEDIA""? M E D I A? D absent? \n\n""REALM""? R E A L M? R absent? \n\nSo HEMAL is a valid option? Or LEGAL? Or maybe ""KOALA""? But K O A L A? No E? We have E fixed at position 2? So not.\n\nWait, another word for Scenario B: ""VELLAL""? Not a word? \n\nOr ""CELLAR""? But C and R absent? \n\nI think the only common words are LEGAL and HEMAL? But HEMAL is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""FECAL""? But C absent.\n\nAnother word: ""FEIAL""? Not a word? \n\nWe might have to use LEGAL or HEMAL? But let\'s choose HEMAL because it tests H and M and has L only at position 5? So no duplicate L? So we can avoid duplication issue.\n\nHEMAL: H E M A L -> positions: H(1), E(2), M(3), A(4), L(5)? So L at position 5. If the word has L at position 5, we\'ll get ✓ at position 5? And if not, a \'-\'? But we know L is present? So if L is at position 5, it\'s the correct position? Otherwise, if L is at position 1, in HEMAL we have no L at position 1? So we\'ll get feedback for L at position 5: if it\'s not position 5, then \'-\'? But since we have L only once in the guess, then we\'ll know L is not at position 5? Then L must be at position 1? And then for position 5, we have L in HEMAL? So it might not match.\n\nBut if we want to test if L is at position 5, we can use HEMAL? Because it puts L in position 5. If we get L correct at position 5, great? If we get L present but in wrong position? That must mean L is at position 1? Because position 3 is not possible? And position 2 and 4 are fixed? So for the real word, L can only be at position 1 or 5? So if we put L at position 5 and it\'s not correct, we\'ll get a \'-\'? Then we know L is at position 1? So we can infer.\n\nTherefore, guessing HEMAL will give us:\n\n- If L is at position 5: then we get L(✓) at position 5? And also, M at position 3 and H at position 1? \n- If L is not at position 5: then we get L(-) meaning L is in another position? But we only have position 1 left? So it should be at position 1? And then position 5 is something else? But in HEMAL, position 5 is L? So the feedback will mark that L as \'-\'? And then we know L must be at position 1?\n\nSo yes, we\'ll get clear feedback.\n\nSimilarly, for the other letters: H at position 1, M at position 3.\n\nWe also test for the presence of H and M? We don\'t know about them yet.\n\nSo HEMAL is a good guess? Even though HEMAL is a medical term? But it\'s in English? Yes.\n\nAlternative: we could try a different word? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe could try for Scenario A a word like ""LEM?A""? No word? \n\nAnother word: ""PEAL""? Too short?  \n\nOr ""LEVEL""? But E duplicate? \n\nI think HEMAL is acceptable.\n\nSo let\'s go with HEMAL.\n\nGuess: H E M A L\n\nBut we have to write a word? So ""HEMAL"" is the word.\n\n<guess>hemal</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\nBased on the previous feedback:\n\n1. **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y (marked ""x"" in past guesses: C, R, N from Guess 1; S, T, D from Guess 2; B, Y from Guess 3).\n2. **Confirmed Fixed Positions:**\n   - **Position 2: E (✓)** confirmed by Guess 3 (""belay"").\n   - **Position 4: A (✓)** confirmed by Guess 2 (""stead"").\n3. **Present Letters with Restrictions:**\n   - **L (-):** Present in the word, but not in position 3 (per Guess 3 feedback).\n   - **E (-):** Position 3 is invalid (per Guess 2 feedback) and position 5 is invalid (per Guess 1 feedback). Since position 2 is confirmed E, no further E positions need testing.\n4. **Word Structure:**  \n   The word follows: **[Pos1] E [Pos3] A [Pos5]**:\n   - **Pos1:** Must contain a new letter or L (since L cannot be in position 3, and positions 2/4 are fixed, L must be in position 1 or 5).\n   - **Pos3:** Any available letter except absent ones and L (L not allowed here).\n   - **Pos5:** Must contain a new letter or L (if L is not in position 1).\n   - **Available letters:** F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding known absent letters).\n5. **Guessing Strategy:**\n   - Test ""HEMAL"" to:\n     - Put **L in position 5** to check if it matches the correct position. If L is ""x"" or ""-"", we can deduce L must be in position 1.\n     - Test new letters **H (position 1)** and **M (position 3)**.\n   - ""HEMAL"" (meaning ""relating to the blood"") fits the pattern and uses common rules for narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>hemal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: stead -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: belay -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(-) A(✓) Y(x)\nGuess 4: hemal -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Guess 2: stead -> S(x), T(x), E(-), A(✓), D(x)
Guess 3: belay -> B(x), E(✓), L(-), A(✓), Y(x)
Guess 4: hemal -> H(x), E(✓), M(x), A(✓), L(✓)

From this feedback, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed positions:
   - Position 2: E (from Guess 3: E(✓) and Guess 4: E(✓))
   - Position 4: A (from Guess 2: A(✓) and others)
   - Position 5: L (from Guess 4: L(✓)) -> This is new and crucial.

In Guess 4 (hemal): H E M A L
- H(x) -> absent
- E(✓) -> correct position (position 2)
- M(x) -> absent
- A(✓) -> correct position (position 4)
- L(✓) -> correct position (position 5)

Therefore, the word must have the format: _ E _ A L

Also, we have confirmed that L is now fixed at position 5.

Moreover, from Guess 3 (belay): 
- L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Now we know it is at position 5.

2. Absent letters:
From all feedback, we can compile the following absent letters:
- Guess 1: C, R, N (x)
- Guess 2: S, T, D (x)
- Guess 3: B, Y (x)
- Guess 4: H, M (x)

Total absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y, H, M

3. Present letters in previous positions:
- From Guess 1: A and E were present but in wrong positions. But now E and A are fixed at positions 2 and 4. Also, we have L fixed at 5. So we don't have any other known present letters from past feedback? Wait, in Guess 3, we had L present (wrong position) and now fixed at 5. So no other floating letters.

4. The word structure is: [Position 1] E [Position 3] A L

We need to find letters for Position 1 and Position 3.

Given the absent letters, we have remaining letters to choose from: F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We must avoid duplicates? There has been no indication of duplicates so far.

We have two new letters to find: one for position 1 and one for position 3.

We can try to form a word with these constraints.

List of possible words: 
Pattern: ? E ? A L

Consider common words matching this pattern with letters from the available set:

- J E W A L ? -> JEWAL is not a word (compare to JEWEL, but that doesn't match)
- V E X A L ? -> VEXAL not a word
- F E A L ? -> FEAL is 4 letters? Then FEALL? Not a word.
- F E L L A ? -> F E L L A -> but position 4 must be A? We have FELLA (positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), A(5)) -> but position 4 is L? Not A? So no.
- G E D A L? GEDAL? Not common word? And D is absent? D is absent.
- K E B A L? K E B A L -> KEBAL? Not a word? Also B absent? So B is absent? Yes.
- P E A L? PEAL is 4 letters? Then PEALY? But Y absent? Or PEAL with 5? Not.
- O V E A L? O V E A L -> O(1), V(2), E(3)... but we need E at position 2? So OVEAL would have E at position 3? Not 2? Not matching.

Another thought: Is ""PETAL"" possible? But T is absent? From Guess 2: T(x) absent. So no.

""METAL""? M and T absent? M and T absent? So no.

""ZEAL""? 4 letters? Then ""Z E A L S""? S absent? Or ""ZEALY""? Y absent? Not.

Try with G: ""G E A L L"" -> GEALL not a word? Or ""G E W A L""? Not.

""J E C A L""? C absent? 

Available consonants: F, G, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z? And vowels: O, U? We can and need to use vowels? Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant? 

Word: ""J E L A L"" -> but duplicate L? and pattern position 3 must be ? and then A at 4? J E L A L? That would be J(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), L(5). But we have fixed: position 5 is L? So position 3 is L? But we already know L cannot be in position 3? From Guess 3: L(-) at position 3? So position 3 cannot be L? So we cannot put L at position 3? So ""J E L A L"" has L at position 3? Invalid.

Alternative: try with U and V? 

Word: ""V E X A L""? not a word? 
Or ""F E U A L""? FEUAL not a word? 

Another word: ""V E G A L""? V E G A L -> vegan? VEGAL? Not really? But formal: VEGAL? Not common? 

Or ""W E E A L""? W E E A L -> duplicate E? And pattern? W(1), E(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). Does WE E A L? ""WE E A L"" -> W E E A L? That's not a standard word? 

But what about ""WHEAL""? W H E A L -> but H is absent? and pattern: we have positions: W(1), H(2) but we need E at position 2? Not. 

Another idea: ""F E A L D""? D absent? 

We have ""PETAL""? T absent? 

""SKYAL""? S absent? 

But we have few options. Maybe we should try a word that uses common letters? 

Consider ""O V A L""? OVAL is 4? So 5 letter? 

How about ""J E D I A L"" ? Not 5? 

Wait, look for words ending with ""AL"" and E at position 2? 

Common words: 
- FEDERAL? But longer? 
- METAL? Absent letters? 
- DEAL: too short? 
- S E A L? S absent? 

Another: ""P E R A L""? Not a word? And R is absent? 

Not many common words. 

What about ""V E I L A L""? Not 5? 

Wait, perhaps ""J E W E L"" has E at wrong position? 

But we found a candidate: earlier I thought of ""WE E A L"" doesn't exist? 

Perhaps ""G E M A L"" ? But GEMAL not a word? 

Or ""K E P A L"" not? 

But wait: ""VEAL"" is 4, but ""VEALS"" S absent? 

""OVALS""? O V A L S -> O(1), V(2), A(3), L(4), S(5)? But we need E at position 2? Not V? 

So pattern is ? E ? A L 

We need the third letter to be a letter that forms a word? 

Possible words:
- ""J E W A L"" -> Jewآl? Not English? 
- ""B E Z A L"" -> BEZAL? Not common? 

Maybe ""F U E L S"" -> but position 3 U? And then not A at 4? 

Let's think with dictionary: 
- FECAL? C absent? 
- FELON? But not A at 4? 

Perhaps ""VIGAL"" doesn't have E? 

Maybe ""KEVEL""? But no A? 

Or ""J E A L"" -> JEAL? 4 letters? Then add: but pattern not matching? 

Another word: ""Q E R A L"" not and Q? And R absent?

This is hard. We might have overlooked a common word? 

What about ""REALM""? R and M absent? 

Or ""IDEAL""? I D E A L -> positions: I(1), D(2) but we need E at position 2? So D is at position 2? That's not E? 

But in our pattern, position 2 is E? Fixed? So words like ""IDEAL"" would have E at position 3? Not 2? 

Similarly, ""DEALT"" has E at position 2? ""DE ALT""? But positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), T(5)? But T absent? and D absent? 

But we have the pattern: _ E _ A L -> so for ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> but A is at position 3? and L at position 4? But we need A at position 4? So not matching: there position 4 is L? Not A? 

We need specifically: Position 4 is A and Position 5 is L? 

So words like:

- ""STEAL""? But S and T absent? 
- ""CHEAP""? But not ending with AL? 

Wait, a better idea: think of words ending with ""AL"" that have E as second letter.

Examples:
- ""V E A L M""? Not? 
- ""J E A L S""? S absent? 
- ""F E G A L""? Not a word? 
- ""P E P A L"" - If allowed, ""PEPAL""? Not standard? 
- ""W E F A L""? Not? 
- ""K E F A L""? KEFAL? Not English? 

But we have found one candidate: ""LEGAL"" (from previous reasoning: L E G A L), but in that case, L is at position 1? And position 5 is L? And in Guess 4 we have L at position 5 fixed? So if position 5 is L, then L at position 1 might be acceptable? But ""LEGAL"" has L at position 1 and position 5? Position 1 L and position 5 L? And E at 2, G at 3, A at 4? So the pattern: L E G A L? 

But we have fixed position 5 as L from Guess 4? So the real word must have position 5 as L? And position 4 as A and position 2 as E? So LEGAL matches that? L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). 

And G is available? And L is at position 1? But does that mean we have two L's? The word has two L's? Now, in the feedback for Guess 3 (belay) we had only one L marked as present?  But if the word has two L's, then when we guess ""belay"" which has one L, we may not see the second L? So it's possible.

Also, in Guess 4 (hemal) we have L at position 5 correct, and they didn't mark the first L? But we didn't have L at position 1 in hemal? So we don't care.

So now, we have LEGAL? And it matches: _ E _ A L -> L E G A L? And the absent letters for G? We have not used G? G is not in the absent list? 

Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y, H, M -> G is not among them? So yes.

And LEGAL is a valid English word? Yes.

But wait, in Guess 4, we got L(✓) at position 5? And Position 3 M was absent? So LEGAL has G at position 3? Which we haven't tested.

Also, what about Position 1: L? In LEGAL, L is at position 1 and position 5? When we guess LEGAL, for position 1 L: if the word also has L at position 1? Or not? Or only at position 5? But we don't know? 

But we need to find a word? So we can guess LEGAL and see.

But we have only 2 tries left? We did 4 guesses? So we have 2 more?

Alternatively, there might be other words? For example, ""PEAL"" is short? Or ""PECAN"" not matching.

Another word: ""FJORD""? But no E at 2? 

After careful thought, LEGAL seems to fit the pattern and available letters? And it's a common word.

So let's guess LEGAL.

But Feedback from Guess 4: hemal had H(x) and M(x), so H and M are absent? LEGAL has no H or M? So it's okay.

So the guess is ""LEGAL""?

But Pattern: Position 1: L? But we think L is at position 5, and position 1 might be something else? But we don't have information about position 1 yet? 

In the real word, position 1 might not be L? We thought position 1 could be L? But with position 5 also L? Or not? 

We have the word as: ? E ? A L

We found LEGAL: which is L E G A L

Is it the only word left? Probably yes? So we'll guess LEGAL.

So <guess>legal</guess>

To confirm, with the pattern: Positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:G, 4:A, 5:L? And G is available? Yes.

We'll see if it's correct? If not, we get more feedback? But let's hope.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

After analyzing all feedback:

1. **Fixed Positions Confirmed:**
   - Position 2: **E** (✓ from Guess 3 and Guess 4)
   - Position 4: **A** (✓ from Guess 2, Guess 3, and Guess 4)
   - Position 5: **L** (✓ from Guess 4 — new confirmation)

2. **Absent Letters (×):** C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y, H, M (compiled from all guesses).  
   - Total absent: 10 letters.

3. **Remaining Letters:** Position 1 and Position 3 must be filled from available letters: F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
   - No duplicates are indicated (based on prior feedback), so positions 1 and 3 likely have distinct letters.

4. **Word Structure:**  
   The word follows: **[Pos1] E [Pos3] A L**.  
   - **Pos1**: Unknown (not L? but L is fixed at position 5; no confirmation yet on position 1).
   - **Pos3**: Unknown (cannot be L per Guess 3’s L(-) at position 3).

5. **Deductions from Feedback:**
   - Guess 4 (hemal) showed L is fixed at position 5, so L cannot be in position 1 for consistency (unless duplicates exist, but no prior hints).
   - Position 3 must be a vowel or consonant from the available set that forms a valid English word.
   - Since position 5 is L and position 3 cannot be L, **position 1 remains** the only slot that could potentially host another instance of L (if duplicates exist), but it is safer to test new letters.

6. **Candidate Words:**
   - Pattern: `? E ? A L`
   - Word must use available letters. Options considered:
     - **LEGAL**: L at position 1 (testing for L duplication?), G at position 3 (available). Valid English word.
     - **VEGAL?/PEAL?**: Not valid/too short.
     - **HEMAL** was tried and rejected due to H/M absence.
   - **Why LEGAL?**
     - It fits `L E G A L` with E(2), A(4), L(5) fixed.
     - Tests G (position 3) and potential L duplication (position 1).
     - If incorrect, feedback will clarify if L can be at position 1, or G is valid.

Given the constraints and common word patterns, **LEGAL** is a strong candidate to test position 1/3 letters while respecting fixed positions.

<guess>legal</guess>",legal,"We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
Guess 2: stead -> S(x), T(x), E(-), A(✓), D(x)
Guess 3: belay -> B(x), E(✓), L(-), A(✓), Y(x)
Guess 4: hemal -> H(x), E(✓), M(x), A(✓), L(✓)

From this feedback, we can deduce:

1. Confirmed positions:
   - Position 2: E (from Guess 3: E(✓) and Guess 4: E(✓))
   - Position 4: A (from Guess 2: A(✓) and others)
   - Position 5: L (from Guess 4: L(✓)) -> This is new and crucial.

In Guess 4 (hemal): H E M A L
- H(x) -> absent
- E(✓) -> correct position (position 2)
- M(x) -> absent
- A(✓) -> correct position (position 4)
- L(✓) -> correct position (position 5)

Therefore, the word must have the format: _ E _ A L

Also, we have confirmed that L is now fixed at position 5.

Moreover, from Guess 3 (belay): 
- L(-) meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. Now we know it is at position 5.

2. Absent letters:
From all feedback, we can compile the following absent letters:
- Guess 1: C, R, N (x)
- Guess 2: S, T, D (x)
- Guess 3: B, Y (x)
- Guess 4: H, M (x)

Total absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, D, B, Y, H, M

3. Present letters in previous positions:
- From Guess 1: A and E were present but in wrong positions. But now E and A are fixed at positions 2 and 4. Also, we have L fixed at 5. So we don't have any other known present letters from past feedback? Wait, in Guess 3, we had L present (wrong position) and now fixed at 5. So no other floating letters.

4. The word structure is: [Position 1] E [Position 3] A L

We need to find letters for Position 1 and Position 3.

Given the absent letters, we have remaining letters to choose from: F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We must avoid duplicates? There has been no indication of duplicates so far.

We have two new letters to find: one for position 1 and one for position 3.

We can try to form a word with these constraints.

List of possible words: 
Pattern: ? E ? A L

Consider common words matching this pattern with letters from the available set:

- J E W A L ? -> JEWAL is not a word (compare to JEWEL, but that doesn't match)
- V E X A L ? -> VEXAL not a word
- F E A L ? -> FEAL is 4 letters? Then FEALL? Not a word.
- F E L L A ? -> F E L L A -> but position 4 must be A? We have FELLA (positions: F(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), A(5)) -> but position 4 is L? Not A? So no.
- G E D A L? GEDAL? Not common word? And D is absent? D is absent.
- K E B A L? K E B A L -> KEBAL? Not a word? Also B absent? So B is absent? Yes.
- P E A L? PEAL is 4 letters? Then PEALY? But Y absent? Or PEAL with 5? Not.
- O V E A L? O V E A L -> O(1), V(2), E(3)... but we need E at position 2? So OVEAL would have E at position 3? Not 2? Not matching.

Another thought: Is ""PETAL"" possible? But T is absent? From Guess 2: T(x) absent. So no.

""METAL""? M and T absent? M and T absent? So no.

""ZEAL""? 4 letters? Then ""Z E A L S""? S absent? Or ""ZEALY""? Y absent? Not.

Try with G: ""G E A L L"" -> GEALL not a word? Or ""G E W A L""? Not.

""J E C A L""? C absent? 

Available consonants: F, G, J, K, P, V, W, X, Z? And vowels: O, U? We can and need to use vowels? Position 3 can be a vowel or consonant? 

Word: ""J E L A L"" -> but duplicate L? and pattern position 3 must be ? and then A at 4? J E L A L? That would be J(1), E(2), L(3), A(4), L(5). But we have fixed: position 5 is L? So position 3 is L? But we already know L cannot be in position 3? From Guess 3: L(-) at position 3? So position 3 cannot be L? So we cannot put L at position 3? So ""J E L A L"" has L at position 3? Invalid.

Alternative: try with U and V? 

Word: ""V E X A L""? not a word? 
Or ""F E U A L""? FEUAL not a word? 

Another word: ""V E G A L""? V E G A L -> vegan? VEGAL? Not really? But formal: VEGAL? Not common? 

Or ""W E E A L""? W E E A L -> duplicate E? And pattern? W(1), E(2), E(3), A(4), L(5). Does WE E A L? ""WE E A L"" -> W E E A L? That's not a standard word? 

But what about ""WHEAL""? W H E A L -> but H is absent? and pattern: we have positions: W(1), H(2) but we need E at position 2? Not. 

Another idea: ""F E A L D""? D absent? 

We have ""PETAL""? T absent? 

""SKYAL""? S absent? 

But we have few options. Maybe we should try a word that uses common letters? 

Consider ""O V A L""? OVAL is 4? So 5 letter? 

How about ""J E D I A L"" ? Not 5? 

Wait, look for words ending with ""AL"" and E at position 2? 

Common words: 
- FEDERAL? But longer? 
- METAL? Absent letters? 
- DEAL: too short? 
- S E A L? S absent? 

Another: ""P E R A L""? Not a word? And R is absent? 

Not many common words. 

What about ""V E I L A L""? Not 5? 

Wait, perhaps ""J E W E L"" has E at wrong position? 

But we found a candidate: earlier I thought of ""WE E A L"" doesn't exist? 

Perhaps ""G E M A L"" ? But GEMAL not a word? 

Or ""K E P A L"" not? 

But wait: ""VEAL"" is 4, but ""VEALS"" S absent? 

""OVALS""? O V A L S -> O(1), V(2), A(3), L(4), S(5)? But we need E at position 2? Not V? 

So pattern is ? E ? A L 

We need the third letter to be a letter that forms a word? 

Possible words:
- ""J E W A L"" -> Jewآl? Not English? 
- ""B E Z A L"" -> BEZAL? Not common? 

Maybe ""F U E L S"" -> but position 3 U? And then not A at 4? 

Let's think with dictionary: 
- FECAL? C absent? 
- FELON? But not A at 4? 

Perhaps ""VIGAL"" doesn't have E? 

Maybe ""KEVEL""? But no A? 

Or ""J E A L"" -> JEAL? 4 letters? Then add: but pattern not matching? 

Another word: ""Q E R A L"" not and Q? And R absent?

This is hard. We might have overlooked a common word? 

What about ""REALM""? R and M absent? 

Or ""IDEAL""? I D E A L -> positions: I(1), D(2) but we need E at position 2? So D is at position 2? That's not E? 

But in our pattern, position 2 is E? Fixed? So words like ""IDEAL"" would have E at position 3? Not 2? 

Similarly, ""DEALT"" has E at position 2? ""DE ALT""? But positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), T(5)? But T absent? and D absent? 

But we have the pattern: _ E _ A L -> so for ""DEALT"": D E A L T -> but A is at position 3? and L at position 4? But we need A at position 4? So not matching: there position 4 is L? Not A? 

We need specifically: Position 4 is A and Position 5 is L? 

So words like:

- ""STEAL""? But S and T absent? 
- ""CHEAP""? But not ending with AL? 

Wait, a better idea: think of words ending with ""AL"" that have E as second letter.

Examples:
- ""V E A L M""? Not? 
- ""J E A L S""? S absent? 
- ""F E G A L""? Not a word? 
- ""P E P A L"" - If allowed, ""PEPAL""? Not standard? 
- ""W E F A L""? Not? 
- ""K E F A L""? KEFAL? Not English? 

But we have found one candidate: ""LEGAL"" (from previous reasoning: L E G A L), but in that case, L is at position 1? And position 5 is L? And in Guess 4 we have L at position 5 fixed? So if position 5 is L, then L at position 1 might be acceptable? But ""LEGAL"" has L at position 1 and position 5? Position 1 L and position 5 L? And E at 2, G at 3, A at 4? So the pattern: L E G A L? 

But we have fixed position 5 as L from Guess 4? So the real word must have position 5 as L? And position 4 as A and position 2 as E? So LEGAL matches that? L(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5). 

And G is available? And L is at position 1? But does that mean we have two L's? The word has two L's? Now, in the feedback for Guess 3 (belay) we had only one L marked as present?
