We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- The letters C, R, E are not in the word.
- The word pattern is: _ _ A N _

We need to make a second guess. We want to try to figure out the other letters.

Since we know A and N are in positions 3 and 4, we can focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.

We should avoid using C, R, E again because they are not in the word.

We also don't know the first, second, and fifth letters.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried yet, and that can help us narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, U, etc.

We also have to consider that the word ends with N, so the fifth letter is still unknown.

We cannot use C, R, E.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _.

We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

For example, let's try to use a word that has S and T because they are common.

Possible words: 
- We want to have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

For our guess, we don't necessarily need to have A and N in the same positions because we are trying to get information about the other letters. But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.

But the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn't give new information. However, that's acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.

But note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.

But in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.

But we cannot be sure until we test.

However, to keep it simple, let's assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.

Therefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.

We can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So the pattern is: ? ? A N ?

We need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.

For example:
- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.

Other words: 
We cannot use E at the end.

We need a word that ends with a letter that isn't E, C, R.

Common words: 
- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.
- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let's spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.

The pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.

So we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?

Examples:
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.

Correct patterns:
- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.
So: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Words:
- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.
- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.
- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.

""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

We haven't tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""FLAWN""? Not common. 
- ""DAINT""? Rare.

How about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn't have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.

Therefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: 
C-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
Similarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.

But we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn't the correct place (we know it's position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.

But for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get '-' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it's only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we'll get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A's, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a '-'. But we have no evidence of that.

But to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don't know, let's try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.

So ideally, for the second guess, let's use a word that has:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.

And avoid C, R, E.

So candidate words? 
""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.

Other words:
""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.

""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.

""DRAIN"": same, has R.

""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don't know.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.

Another: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don't know if P, L, T are used.

Among these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?

We want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.

Also, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don't know about them yet.

Another candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.

We need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.

So the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]

Possible words: 
- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it's less common.)

""BALMY""? Not pattern.

""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.

Common words: 
- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.
- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T
- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T
- SHANT: not common.

Also, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.

We must have A at pos 3.

So I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.

Let me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.

But let's see which letters we can cover.

In ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.
In ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.
Both test T at the end? Position 5.

We know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.

We don't know what else is in the word? So it's fine.

But we might want to cover different letters.

Another word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.

""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.

""TRAIN"": has R.

So let's choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?

I think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don't know. Alternatively, let's consider ""BAITS""? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Since we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.

But let's go with ""SLANT"".

But make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.

So let's guess ""SLANT"".

Feedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don't know about them.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don't put A at position 3, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we don't expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get '-', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let's see.

For example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": 
- S at position 1: could be correct or not?
- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get '-' if there's no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we'll get A marked as '-'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?

That way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.

But let's compare:

Option 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.

Option 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": 
- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as '-'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.

But so we'd get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.

By doing this, we can confirm that there's no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two '-' or something, but we don't have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get '-' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don't know.

But also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a '-' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.

So I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.

Another word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.

But that has D? Which is also good.

Of course, we have many choices.

But ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.

But I'll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.

So guess: ""slant""

But let me write it: S-L-A-N-T

We are using S,L,T? Which are common.

So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' at position 3 and 'N' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).
- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.
- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.
- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is ""slant"".

<guess>slant</guess>",slant,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)

E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- The letters C, R, E are not in the word.
- The word pattern is: _ _ A N _

We need to make a second guess. We want to try to figure out the other letters.

Other possibilities:

- ""DAINT""? Rare.

How about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn't have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.

Therefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: 
C-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
Similarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.

But we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn't the correct place (we know it's position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.

But for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get '-' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it's only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we'll get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A's, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a '-'. But we have no evidence of that.

But to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don't know, let's try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.

So ideally, for the second guess, let's use a word that has:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.

And avoid C, R, E.

So candidate words? 
""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.

Other words:
""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.

""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.

""DRAIN"": same, has R.

""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don't know.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.

Another: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don't know if P, L, T are used.

Among these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?

We want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.

Also, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don't know about them yet.

Another candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.

We need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.

So the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]

Possible words: 
- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it's less common.)

""BALMY""? Not pattern.

""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.

Common words: 
- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.
- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T
- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T
- SHANT: not common.

Also, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.

We must have A at pos 3.

So I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.

Let me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.

But let's see which letters we can cover.

In ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.
In ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.
Both test T at the end? Position 5.

We know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.

We don't know what else is in the word? So it's fine.

But we might want to cover different letters.

Another word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.

""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.

""TRAIN"": has R.

So let's choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?

I think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don't know. Alternatively, let's consider ""BAITS""? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Since we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.

But let's go with ""SLANT"".

But make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.

So let's guess ""SLANT"".

Feedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don't know about them.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don't put A at position 3, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we don't expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get '-', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let's see.

For example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": 
- S at position 1: could be correct or not?
- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get '-' if there's no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we'll get A marked as '-'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?

That way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.

But let's compare:

Option 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.

Option 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": 
- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as '-'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.

But so we'd get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.

By doing this, we can confirm that there's no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two '-' or something, but we don't have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get '-' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don't know.

But also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a '-' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.

So I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.

Another word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.

But that has D? Which is also good.

Of course, we have many choices.

But ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.

But I'll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.

So guess: ""slant""

But let me write it: S-L-A-N-T

We are using S,L,T? Which are common.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' at position 3 and 'N' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).
- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.
- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.
- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is ""slant"".",Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,flank,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- The letters C, R, E are not in the word.
- The word pattern is: _ _ A N _

We need to make a second guess. We want to try to figure out the other letters.

Since we know A and N are in positions 3 and 4, we can focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.

We should avoid using C, R, E again because they are not in the word.

We also don't know the first, second, and fifth letters.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried yet, and that can help us narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, U, etc.

We also have to consider that the word ends with N, so the fifth letter is still unknown.

We cannot use C, R, E.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _.

We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

For example, let's try to use a word that has S and T because they are common.

Possible words: 
- We want to have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

For our guess, we don't necessarily need to have A and N in the same positions because we are trying to get information about the other letters. But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.

But the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn't give new information. However, that's acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.

But note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.

But in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.

But we cannot be sure until we test.

However, to keep it simple, let's assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.

Therefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.

We can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So the pattern is: ? ? A N ?

We need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.

For example:
- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.

Other words: 
We cannot use E at the end.

We need a word that ends with a letter that isn't E, C, R.

Common words: 
- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.
- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let's spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.

The pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.

So we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?

Examples:
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.

Correct patterns:
- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.
So: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Words:
- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.
- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.
- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.

""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

We haven't tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""FLAWN""? Not common. 
- ""DAINT""? Rare.

How about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn't have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.

Therefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: 
C-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
Similarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.

But we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn't the correct place (we know it's position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.

But for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get '-' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it's only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we'll get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A's, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a '-'. But we have no evidence of that.

But to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don't know, let's try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.

So ideally, for the second guess, let's use a word that has:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.

And avoid C, R, E.

So candidate words? 
""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.

Other words:
""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.

""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.

""DRAIN"": same, has R.

""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don't know.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.

Another: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don't know if P, L, T are used.

Among these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?

We want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.

Also, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don't know about them yet.

Another candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.

We need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.

So the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]

Possible words: 
- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it's less common.)

""BALMY""? Not pattern.

""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.

Common words: 
- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.
- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T
- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T
- SHANT: not common.

Also, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.

We must have A at pos 3.

So I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.

Let me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.

But let's see which letters we can cover.

In ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.
In ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.
Both test T at the end? Position 5.

We know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.

We don't know what else is in the word? So it's fine.

But we might want to cover different letters.

Another word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.

""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.

""TRAIN"": has R.

So let's choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?

I think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don't know. Alternatively, let's consider ""BAITS""? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Since we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.

But let's go with ""SLANT"".

But make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.

So let's guess ""SLANT"".

Feedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don't know about them.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don't put A at position 3, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we don't expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get '-', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let's see.

For example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": 
- S at position 1: could be correct or not?
- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get '-' if there's no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we'll get A marked as '-'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?

That way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.

But let's compare:

Option 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.

Option 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": 
- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as '-'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.

But so we'd get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.

By doing this, we can confirm that there's no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two '-' or something, but we don't have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get '-' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don't know.

But also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a '-' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.

So I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.

Another word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.

But that has D? Which is also good.

Of course, we have many choices.

But ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.

But I'll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.

So guess: ""slant""

But let me write it: S-L-A-N-T

We are using S,L,T? Which are common.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' at position 3 and 'N' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).
- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.
- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.
- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is ""slant"".

But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.\n\nBut the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn\'t give new information. However, that\'s acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.\n\nBut note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.\n\nBut in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.\n\nBut we cannot be sure until we test.\n\nHowever, to keep it simple, let\'s assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.\n\nTherefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.\n\nWe can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nSo the pattern is: ? ? A N ?\n\nWe need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.\n\nFor example:\n- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.\n\nOther words: \nWe cannot use E at the end.\n\nWe need a word that ends with a letter that isn\'t E, C, R.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.\n- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.\n- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let\'s spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.\n\nThe pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.\n\nSo we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?\n\nExamples:\n- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.\n\nCorrect patterns:\n- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.\nSo: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.\n\nWords:\n- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.\n- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.\n- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.\n\n""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.\n\nOther possibilities: \n- ""FLAWN""? Not common. \n- ""DAINT""? Rare.\n\nHow about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn\'t have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.\n\nTherefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nSo ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: \nC-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\nSimilarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.\n\nBut we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn\'t the correct place (we know it\'s position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.\n\nBut for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get \'-\' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it\'s only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we\'ll get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A\'s, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a \'-\'. But we have no evidence of that.\n\nBut to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don\'t know, let\'s try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.\n\nSo ideally, for the second guess, let\'s use a word that has:\n- A in position 3\n- N in position 4\n- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.\n\nAnd avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo candidate words? \n""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.\n\nOther words:\n""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.\n\n""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.\n\n""DRAIN"": same, has R.\n\n""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don\'t know.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.\n\nAnother: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don\'t know if P, L, T are used.\n\nAmong these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?\n\nWe want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.\n\nAlso, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don\'t know about them yet.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.\n\nWe need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.\n\nSo the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]\n\nPossible words: \n- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it\'s less common.)\n\n""BALMY""? Not pattern.\n\n""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.\n\nCommon words: \n- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.\n- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T\n- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T\n- SHANT: not common.\n\nAlso, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.\n\nWe must have A at pos 3.\n\nSo I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.\n\nLet me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.\n\nBut let\'s see which letters we can cover.\n\nIn ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.\nIn ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.\nBoth test T at the end? Position 5.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.\n\nWe don\'t know what else is in the word? So it\'s fine.\n\nBut we might want to cover different letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.\n\n""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.\n\n""TRAIN"": has R.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?\n\nI think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don\'t know. Alternatively, let\'s consider ""BAITS""? Doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSince we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SLANT"".\n\nFeedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don\'t know about them.\n\nSo I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don\'t put A at position 3, we might get \'-\' if A is elsewhere? But we don\'t expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get \'-\', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it\'s at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let\'s see.\n\nFor example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": \n- S at position 1: could be correct or not?\n- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get \'-\' if there\'s no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we\'ll get A marked as \'-\'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?\n\nThat way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.\n\nOption 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": \n- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as \'-\'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.\n\nBut so we\'d get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.\n\nBy doing this, we can confirm that there\'s no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two \'-\' or something, but we don\'t have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get \'-\' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a \'-\' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nSo I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.\n\nAnother word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.\n\nBut that has D? Which is also good.\n\nOf course, we have many choices.\n\nBut ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.\n\nBut I\'ll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.\n\nSo guess: ""slant""\n\nBut let me write it: S-L-A-N-T\n\nWe are using S,L,T? Which are common.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' at position 3 and \'N\' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).\n- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.\n- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.\n- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""slant"".\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: x (not in word)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it's marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]
- T: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Also, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven't encountered any.

We need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?

Possible words:
- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that's 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.
- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.
- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.
- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.
- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.

We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.

So let's list possible words:
- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)
- ""GLAND""
- ""FLANK""
- ""PLANK""
- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.
- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.

Also, ""CLAMP"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.

So we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.

Now, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.

We know the pattern is _ L A N _

We can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.

But note: we don't know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven't guessed? We need to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried? For example, vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.

Is there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.

""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.

So probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.

We can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.

So let's pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.

But we don't know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.

Let me think: after this guess, we might get more information.

We can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it's the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.

For example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.

So I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.

Now, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let's choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""bland"" is also valid.

But let's see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.

We can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.

So I think ""blank"" is a good choice.

But let's write it: B L A N K

We are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.

If we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.

If not, we eliminate them.

But we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we'll see.

So I'll go with ""blank"".

But wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.

But let's pick ""blank"".

Alternatively, to cover a vowel? We don't have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven't tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don't have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""blank"" is fine.

But let's check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?

Guess: ""blank""

<guess>blank</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)
- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.
- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"". ""Blank"" is chosen to test new common letters (B and K) and could be a potential solution.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- ""Blank"" fits the pattern `_ L A N _` with B in position 1 and K in position 5.
- B and K are high-frequency consonants not yet tested, providing valuable information:
  - If B is correct, it confirms position 1.
  - If K is correct, it confirms position 5.
  - If either is marked as present but wrong position (e.g., `-`), it indicates a duplicate letter or a different position (though duplicates are less likely based on prior feedback).
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while avoiding eliminated letters.

<guess>blank</guess>",blank,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: x (not in word)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it's marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]
- T: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Also, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven't encountered any.

We need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?

Possible words:
- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that's 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.
- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.
- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.
- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.
- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.

We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.

So let's list possible words:
- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)
- ""GLAND""
- ""FLANK""
- ""PLANK""
- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.
- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.

Also, ""CLAMP"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.

So we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.

Now, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.

We know the pattern is _ L A N _

We can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.

But note: we don't know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven't guessed? We need to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried? For example, vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.

Is there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.

""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.

So probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.

We can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.

So let's pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.

But we don't know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.

Let me think: after this guess, we might get more information.

We can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it's the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.

For example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.

So I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.

Now, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let's choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""bland"" is also valid.

But let's see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.

We can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.

So I think ""blank"" is a good choice.

But let's write it: B L A N K

We are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.

If we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.

If not, we eliminate them.

But we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we'll see.

So I'll go with ""blank"".

But wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.

But let's pick ""blank"".

Alternatively, to cover a vowel? We don't have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven't tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don't have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""blank"" is fine.

But let's check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?

Guess: ""blank""

<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)
- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.
- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"". ""Blank"" is chosen to test new common letters (B and K) and could be a potential solution.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- ""Blank"" fits the pattern `_ L A N _` with B in position 1 and K in position 5.
- B and K are high-frequency consonants not yet tested, providing valuable information:
  - If B is correct, it confirms position 1.
  - If K is correct, it confirms position 5.
  - If either is marked as present but wrong position (e.g., `-`), it indicates a duplicate letter or a different position (though duplicates are less likely based on prior feedback).
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while avoiding eliminated letters.",Guess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- The letters C, R, E are not in the word.
- The word pattern is: _ _ A N _

We need to make a second guess. We want to try to figure out the other letters.

Since we know A and N are in positions 3 and 4, we can focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.

We should avoid using C, R, E again because they are not in the word.

We also don't know the first, second, and fifth letters.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried yet, and that can help us narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, U, etc.

We also have to consider that the word ends with N, so the fifth letter is still unknown.

We cannot use C, R, E.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _.

We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

For example, let's try to use a word that has S and T because they are common.

Possible words: 
- We want to have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

For our guess, we don't necessarily need to have A and N in the same positions because we are trying to get information about the other letters. But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.

But the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn't give new information. However, that's acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.

But note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.

But in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.

But we cannot be sure until we test.

However, to keep it simple, let's assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.

Therefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.

We can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So the pattern is: ? ? A N ?

We need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.

For example:
- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.

Other words: 
We cannot use E at the end.

We need a word that ends with a letter that isn't E, C, R.

Common words: 
- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.
- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let's spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.

The pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.

So we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?

Examples:
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.

Correct patterns:
- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.
So: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Words:
- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.
- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.
- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.

""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

We haven't tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""FLAWN""? Not common. 
- ""DAINT""? Rare.

How about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn't have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.

Therefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: 
C-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
Similarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.

But we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn't the correct place (we know it's position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.

But for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get '-' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it's only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we'll get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A's, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a '-'. But we have no evidence of that.

But to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don't know, let's try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.

So ideally, for the second guess, let's use a word that has:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.

And avoid C, R, E.

So candidate words? 
""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.

Other words:
""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.

""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.

""DRAIN"": same, has R.

""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don't know.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.

Another: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don't know if P, L, T are used.

Among these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?

We want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.

Also, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don't know about them yet.

Another candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.

We need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.

So the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]

Possible words: 
- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it's less common.)

""BALMY""? Not pattern.

""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.

Common words: 
- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.
- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T
- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T
- SHANT: not common.

Also, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.

We must have A at pos 3.

So I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.

Let me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.

But let's see which letters we can cover.

In ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.
In ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.
Both test T at the end? Position 5.

We know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.

We don't know what else is in the word? So it's fine.

But we might want to cover different letters.

Another word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.

""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.

""TRAIN"": has R.

So let's choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?

I think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don't know. Alternatively, let's consider ""BAITS""? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Since we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.

But let's go with ""SLANT"".

But make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.

So let's guess ""SLANT"".

Feedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don't know about them.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don't put A at position 3, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we don't expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get '-', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let's see.

For example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": 
- S at position 1: could be correct or not?
- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get '-' if there's no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we'll get A marked as '-'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?

That way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.

But let's compare:

Option 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.

Option 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": 
- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as '-'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.

But so we'd get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.

By doing this, we can confirm that there's no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two '-' or something, but we don't have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get '-' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don't know.

But also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a '-' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.

So I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.

Another word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.

But that has D? Which is also good.

Of course, we have many choices.

But ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.

But I'll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.

So guess: ""slant""

But let me write it: S-L-A-N-T

We are using S,L,T? Which are common.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' at position 3 and 'N' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).
- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.
- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.
- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is ""slant"".

<guess>slant</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: x (not in word)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it's marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]
- T: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Also, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven't encountered any.

We need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?

Possible words:
- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that's 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.
- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.
- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.
- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.
- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.

We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.

So let's list possible words:
- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)
- ""GLAND""
- ""FLANK""
- ""PLANK""
- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.
- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.

Also, ""CLAMP"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.

So we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.

Now, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.

We know the pattern is _ L A N _

We can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.

But note: we don't know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven't guessed? We need to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried? For example, vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.

Is there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.

""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.

So probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.

We can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.

So let's pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.

But we don't know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.

Let me think: after this guess, we might get more information.

We can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it's the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.

For example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.

So I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.

Now, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let's choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""bland"" is also valid.

But let's see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.

We can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.

So I think ""blank"" is a good choice.

But let's write it: B L A N K

We are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.

If we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.

If not, we eliminate them.

But we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we'll see.

So I'll go with ""blank"".

But wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.

But let's pick ""blank"".

Alternatively, to cover a vowel? We don't have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven't tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don't have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""blank"" is fine.

But let's check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?

Guess: ""blank""

<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)
- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.
- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"". ""Blank"" is chosen to test new common letters (B and K) and could be a potential solution.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- ""Blank"" fits the pattern `_ L A N _` with B in position 1 and K in position 5.
- B and K are high-frequency consonants not yet tested, providing valuable information:
  - If B is correct, it confirms position 1.
  - If K is correct, it confirms position 5.
  - If either is marked as present but wrong position (e.g., `-`), it indicates a duplicate letter or a different position (though duplicates are less likely based on prior feedback).
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while avoiding eliminated letters.

We want to try to figure out the other letters.\n\nSince we know A and N are in positions 3 and 4, we can focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nWe should avoid using C, R, E again because they are not in the word.\n\nWe also don\'t know the first, second, and fifth letters.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word that includes common letters that we haven\'t tried yet, and that can help us narrow down possibilities.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, U, etc.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word ends with N, so the fifth letter is still unknown.\n\nWe cannot use C, R, E.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _.\n\nWe don\'t know the fifth letter, so we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to use a word that has S and T because they are common.\n\nPossible words: \n- We want to have A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nFor our guess, we don\'t necessarily need to have A and N in the same positions because we are trying to get information about the other letters. But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.\n\nBut the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn\'t give new information. However, that\'s acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.\n\nBut note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.\n\nBut in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.\n\nBut we cannot be sure until we test.\n\nHowever, to keep it simple, let\'s assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.\n\nTherefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.\n\nWe can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nSo the pattern is: ? ? A N ?\n\nWe need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.\n\nFor example:\n- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.\n\nOther words: \nWe cannot use E at the end.\n\nWe need a word that ends with a letter that isn\'t E, C, R.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.\n- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.\n- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let\'s spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.\n\nThe pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.\n\nSo we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?\n\nExamples:\n- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.\n\nCorrect patterns:\n- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.\nSo: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.\n\nWords:\n- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.\n- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.\n- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.\n\n""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.\n\nWe haven\'t tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.\n\nOther possibilities: \n- ""FLAWN""? Not common. \n- ""DAINT""? Rare.\n\nHow about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn\'t have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.\n\nTherefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nSo ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: \nC-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\nSimilarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.\n\nBut we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn\'t the correct place (we know it\'s position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.\n\nBut for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get \'-\' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it\'s only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we\'ll get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A\'s, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a \'-\'. But we have no evidence of that.\n\nBut to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don\'t know, let\'s try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.\n\nSo ideally, for the second guess, let\'s use a word that has:\n- A in position 3\n- N in position 4\n- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.\n\nAnd avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo candidate words? \n""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.\n\nOther words:\n""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.\n\n""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.\n\n""DRAIN"": same, has R.\n\n""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don\'t know.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.\n\nAnother: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don\'t know if P, L, T are used.\n\nAmong these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?\n\nWe want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.\n\nAlso, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don\'t know about them yet.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.\n\nWe need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.\n\nSo the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]\n\nPossible words: \n- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it\'s less common.)\n\n""BALMY""? Not pattern.\n\n""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.\n\nCommon words: \n- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.\n- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T\n- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T\n- SHANT: not common.\n\nAlso, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.\n\nWe must have A at pos 3.\n\nSo I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.\n\nLet me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.\n\nBut let\'s see which letters we can cover.\n\nIn ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.\nIn ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.\nBoth test T at the end? Position 5.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.\n\nWe don\'t know what else is in the word? So it\'s fine.\n\nBut we might want to cover different letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.\n\n""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.\n\n""TRAIN"": has R.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?\n\nI think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don\'t know. Alternatively, let\'s consider ""BAITS""? Doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSince we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SLANT"".\n\nFeedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don\'t know about them.\n\nSo I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don\'t put A at position 3, we might get \'-\' if A is elsewhere? But we don\'t expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get \'-\', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it\'s at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let\'s see.\n\nFor example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": \n- S at position 1: could be correct or not?\n- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get \'-\' if there\'s no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we\'ll get A marked as \'-\'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?\n\nThat way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.\n\nOption 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": \n- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as \'-\'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.\n\nBut so we\'d get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.\n\nBy doing this, we can confirm that there\'s no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two \'-\' or something, but we don\'t have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get \'-\' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a \'-\' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nSo I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.\n\nAnother word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.\n\nBut that has D? Which is also good.\n\nOf course, we have many choices.\n\nBut ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.\n\nBut I\'ll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.\n\nSo guess: ""slant""\n\nBut let me write it: S-L-A-N-T\n\nWe are using S,L,T? Which are common.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' at position 3 and \'N\' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).\n- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.\n- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.\n- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""slant"".\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)\n- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""slant""\n- S: x (not in word)\n- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it\'s marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]\n- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _\n- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]\n\nWe know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven\'t encountered any.\n\nWe need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nLetters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.\n- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that\'s 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.\n- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.\n- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.\n- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.\n- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nWe can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.\n\nWe must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)\n- ""GLAND""\n- ""FLANK""\n- ""PLANK""\n- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.\n- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.\n\nAlso, ""CLAMP"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.\n\nSo we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.\n\nNow, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.\n\nWe know the pattern is _ L A N _\n\nWe can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven\'t guessed? We need to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tried? For example, vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.\n\nIs there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.\n\n""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.\n\nSo probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.\n\nSo let\'s pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.\n\nLet me think: after this guess, we might get more information.\n\nWe can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it\'s the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.\n\nFor example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.\n\nSo I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.\n\nNow, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""bland"" is also valid.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.\n\nWe can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.\n\nSo I think ""blank"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s write it: B L A N K\n\nWe are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.\n\nIf not, we eliminate them.\n\nBut we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we\'ll see.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""blank"".\n\nBut wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""blank"".\n\nAlternatively, to cover a vowel? We don\'t have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven\'t tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don\'t have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo I think ""blank"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?\n\nGuess: ""blank""\n\n<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)\n- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.\n- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).\n- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"".

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
  - A is in position 3, N in position 4.
  - C, R, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""slant"" -> S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)
  - L is in position 2 (since in ""slant"", L is at position 2 and marked ✓).
  - S and T are not in the word.
  - Now the pattern is: _ L A N _

Guess 3: ""blank"" -> B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)
  - B is not in the word (x).
  - L, A, N are correct in their positions (positions 2, 3, 4).
  - K is marked ✓, but note that in ""blank"", K is at position 5. So K is correct at position 5.

Therefore, the feedback from guess 3 tells us:
- B is not in the word (eliminated).
- K is correct at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word is: ? L A N K
  Specifically: position 1: ?, position 2: L, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: K.
  So the word ends with ""K"", making it: _ L A N K

- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, B (from previous feedbacks).

We need to find a word that matches the pattern: [letter] L A N K

The first letter must be a letter not eliminated and not used in previous guesses (except L, A, N, K which are confirmed).

Available letters: We must use a letter for position 1 that hasn't been eliminated and isn't L, A, N, K (which are already placed).

Eliminated: C, E, R, S, T, B

The word is almost solved: we have "" L A N K"" at positions 2-5, so we only need the first letter.

Possible letters for position 1: All letters except the eliminated ones and except L, A, N, K (but L,A,N,K are already placed elsewhere, so they can't be in position 1 unless duplicated? But feedback hasn't shown any duplicates so far).

Check for duplicates: In feedback, when we guessed words, we only had one instance marked per position. For example, in ""blank"", B was x and others were ✓. Similarly, no '-' for duplicate, so likely no duplicates.

Therefore, the first letter must be a new letter, not eliminated and not previously used? Actually, the letters we have used and not eliminated are L, A, N, K? But we can reuse letters? No, in Wordle, duplicates can exist, but in this case, we don't have evidence.

Given the feedback:
- In ""crane"": only A and N were correct at positions 3 and 4? If there were duplicates, we might have seen extra '-' for letters that are in the word but not in position. For example, if the word had two A's, and we put A at a wrong position, we'd get '-'. But in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and got ✓, so if there were another A, and we didn't put it elsewhere, we wouldn't see it? Similarly, in ""slant"" and ""blank"", we put L, A, N in the correct positions? And no duplicate marks? So it's likely no duplicates.

Thus, the first letter must be a consonant (probably) that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word: ? L A N K

What words end with ""LANK""? 
- ""blank"" was already guessed? But we guessed it, and feedback showed B(x) but K(✓) so the word is not ""blank""? Because B was wrong? And K was right? So the word has K at the end? So it must be a word ending with ""LANK"", with a letter that is not B? And not eliminated.

Common words:
- ""plank"": P L A N K
- ""flank"": F L A N K
- ""clank"": but C eliminated? So not.
- ""slank"": S eliminated? Not.
- ""trunk"": Doesn't match pattern? No, we need L A N.

""plank"" and ""flank"" are both valid? Also ""alank""? Not common. Or ""glank""? Not common? Not real word.

So realistic possibilities: 
- plank (with P at position 1)
- flank (with F at position 1)

Other options? ""blink"" but that has I? Positions? ""blink"" is B L I N K -> not A at position 3? Our word has A at position 3? So not.

Therefore, we have two candidates: ""plank"" and ""flank"".

We have used P? Not? We haven't guessed P? Or F? So both are available.

We need to test one of them? But we have only one guess? Actually, we are on guess 4? We started with guess 1: crane, 2: slant, 3: blank? Now guess 4.

We can guess either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Let's pick one? And hope it's correct? Or is there a better guess that can distinguish? But we only have two possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? Since we get 6 tries? So we can guess one? If it's wrong, then we know the other? But we don't want to waste a guess? But there is no way to test both with one? Because we don't have a word that would include extra letters? We have to test one of them?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both F and P? But that might be inefficient? But our pattern is fixed? Positions 2-5 are known? So we cannot change them? We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5? And only position 1 varies? So our guess must be either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Or other rare words? But probably not.

So I think we should guess ""plank""? Because P is a common letter? Or ""flank""? Both are equally common? We can arbitrarily pick one.

But note: from ""blank"", we had B x? So not B? So ""plank"" or ""flank""?

Let me guess ""plank""? Or to be systematic? We can guess ""flank"" to test F? Same difference.

But we don't have information on F? We have to pick one? So let's guess ""plank"".

So guess: ""plank""

If it's wrong, then we know it's ""flank""? And we use guess 5.

But let me confirm: word ""plank"": P L A N K? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)? Yes.

Similarly, ""flank"": F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)

So now, I'll guess ""plank"".

But in the feedback for ""blank"", we saw K(✓) at position 5? So yes.

So <guess>plank</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Pattern**: The word must be in the form ? L A N K, where position 2 is L, position 3 is A, position 4 is N, and position 5 is K (confirmed in Guess 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, E, S, T, B (marked 'x' in feedback).
- **Known positions**: Only position 1 (first letter) is unknown. Given the common English words fitting this pattern, the only plausible candidates are:
  - **plank**: P at position 1
  - **flank**: F at position 1

To solve efficiently, we prioritize testing one of these candidates. ""Plank"" is a common word and tests the letter P, which has not been guessed yet. If incorrect, the solution must be ""flank"", allowing for a logical next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that can give us good information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common in English.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- The letters C, R, E are not in the word.
- The word pattern is: _ _ A N _

We need to make a second guess. We want to try to figure out the other letters.

Since we know A and N are in positions 3 and 4, we can focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.

We should avoid using C, R, E again because they are not in the word.

We also don't know the first, second, and fifth letters.

A good strategy is to use a word that includes common letters that we haven't tried yet, and that can help us narrow down possibilities.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, U, etc.

We also have to consider that the word ends with N, so the fifth letter is still unknown.

We cannot use C, R, E.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _.

We don't know the fifth letter, so we can try a word that has different letters in positions 1, 2, and 5.

For example, let's try to use a word that has S and T because they are common.

Possible words: 
- We want to have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

For our guess, we don't necessarily need to have A and N in the same positions because we are trying to get information about the other letters. But note that in the feedback, if we put A and N again, we will get ✓ for them, but that might be less informative for other positions.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat A and N? But wait, we know A and N are in the word, and we know their correct positions. So if we use them again in the same positions, we can focus on the other letters.

But the feedback will show ✓ for A and N again, which doesn't give new information. However, that's acceptable because we are primarily testing the new letters.

But note: We can also put A or N in a different position? But we know A is only in the 3rd position? Not necessarily. It could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say there are no repeated letters, so we must consider that possibility.

But in our feedback, we had one A and one N, and they were marked correct. If there were duplicates, we might see additional marks. However, the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates, so for now, we assume the word does not have duplicate letters? Not necessarily, because if we had guessed a duplicate, the feedback would show accordingly. But since our first guess had no duplicates, and the feedback showed one A and one N as correct, it might be that these letters appear only once.

But we cannot be sure until we test.

However, to keep it simple, let's assume for now that there are no duplicates. So A and N appear exactly once.

Therefore, in our second guess, we should avoid C, R, E and try other consonants and vowels.

We can choose a word that has new letters in positions 1,2,5 and keep A in position 3 and N in position 4.

So the pattern is: ? ? A N ?

We need a word that ends with something but has A in third and N in fourth.

For example:
- ""PLANE"": but P and L are new? Then E is at the end, but E was already not present. E is eliminated. So we cannot use E. So ""PLANE"" has E, which is dead.

Other words: 
We cannot use E at the end.

We need a word that ends with a letter that isn't E, C, R.

Common words: 
- ""TRAIN"": but T, R in it? R was eliminated, so we cannot use R.
- ""GRAIN"": same, R is eliminated.
- ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N -> then I is new? But this ends with N? A is at position 3? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4)? But we need N at position 4. In ""PLAIN"", position 4 is I, not N? Wait, let's spell: P-L-A-I-N? Then positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N -> so N is at 5th, not 4th. But we need N at 4th.

The pattern must have A at 3 and N at 4: so positions 3 and 4 are A and N. Then position 5 must be a different letter.

So we need words of the form: ? ? A N ?

Examples:
- ""MANGO"": M(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? Here: M-A-N-G-O: position 3 is N? Not A. We need A at third.

Correct patterns:
- Position 3: A, Position 4: N.
So: letter1, letter2, A, N, letter5.

Words:
- ""MEANT"": M(1), E(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). But E is eliminated. So not.
- ""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). This works: new letters G,I,T. And E,C,R not present.
- ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? No, P-A-I-N-T? Position 1:P, 2:A? But we need A at third? Then position 3:I? Not A? So no.

""GIANT"": G,I,A,N,T -> positions: G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

We haven't tested G, I, T. So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.

Other possibilities: 
- ""FLAWN""? Not common. 
- ""DAINT""? Rare.

How about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn't have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.

Therefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.

So ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: 
C-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
Similarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.

But we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn't the correct place (we know it's position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.

But for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get '-' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it's only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we'll get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A's, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a '-'. But we have no evidence of that.

But to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don't know, let's try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.

So ideally, for the second guess, let's use a word that has:
- A in position 3
- N in position 4
- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.

And avoid C, R, E.

So candidate words? 
""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.

Other words:
""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.

""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.

""DRAIN"": same, has R.

""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don't know.

""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.

Another: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don't know if P, L, T are used.

Among these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?

We want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.

Also, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don't know about them yet.

Another candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.

We need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.

So the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]

Possible words: 
- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it's less common.)

""BALMY""? Not pattern.

""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.

Common words: 
- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.
- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T
- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T
- SHANT: not common.

Also, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.

We must have A at pos 3.

So I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.

Let me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.

But let's see which letters we can cover.

In ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.
In ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.
Both test T at the end? Position 5.

We know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.

We don't know what else is in the word? So it's fine.

But we might want to cover different letters.

Another word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.

""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.

""TRAIN"": has R.

So let's choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?

I think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don't know. Alternatively, let's consider ""BAITS""? Doesn't fit the pattern.

Since we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.

But let's go with ""SLANT"".

But make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.

So let's guess ""SLANT"".

Feedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don't know about them.

So I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn't necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don't put A at position 3, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we don't expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get '-', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it's at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let's see.

For example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": 
- S at position 1: could be correct or not?
- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get '-' if there's no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we'll get A marked as '-'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?

That way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.

But let's compare:

Option 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.

Option 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": 
- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as '-'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.

But so we'd get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.

By doing this, we can confirm that there's no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two '-' or something, but we don't have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get '-' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don't know.

But also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a '-' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.

So I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLANT"".

But let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.

Another word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.

But that has D? Which is also good.

Of course, we have many choices.

But ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.

But I'll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.

So guess: ""slant""

But let me write it: S-L-A-N-T

We are using S,L,T? Which are common.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:
- The secret word has 'A' at position 3 and 'N' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).
- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.
- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.
- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.

Therefore, the next guess is ""slant"".

<guess>slant</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""slant""
- S: x (not in word)
- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it's marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]
- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]
- T: x (not in word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Also, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven't encountered any.

We need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?

Possible words:
- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.
- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that's 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.
- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.
- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.
- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.
- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.

But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.

We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.

So let's list possible words:
- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)
- ""GLAND""
- ""FLANK""
- ""PLANK""
- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.
- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.

Also, ""CLAMP"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.

So we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.

Now, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.

We know the pattern is _ L A N _

We can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.

But note: we don't know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven't guessed? We need to cover possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tried? For example, vowels? We haven't tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.

Is there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.

""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.

So probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.

We can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.

So let's pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.

But we don't know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.

Let me think: after this guess, we might get more information.

We can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it's the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.

For example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.

So I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.

Now, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.

So let's choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""bland"" is also valid.

But let's see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.

We can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.

So I think ""blank"" is a good choice.

But let's write it: B L A N K

We are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.

If we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.

If not, we eliminate them.

But we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we'll see.

So I'll go with ""blank"".

But wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.

But let's pick ""blank"".

Alternatively, to cover a vowel? We don't have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven't tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don't have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn't fit.

So I think ""blank"" is fine.

But let's check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?

Guess: ""blank""

<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)
- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.
- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).
- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"". ""Blank"" is chosen to test new common letters (B and K) and could be a potential solution.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- ""Blank"" fits the pattern `_ L A N _` with B in position 1 and K in position 5.
- B and K are high-frequency consonants not yet tested, providing valuable information:
  - If B is correct, it confirms position 1.
  - If K is correct, it confirms position 5.
  - If either is marked as present but wrong position (e.g., `-`), it indicates a duplicate letter or a different position (though duplicates are less likely based on prior feedback).
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while avoiding eliminated letters.

<guess>blank</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
  - A is in position 3, N in position 4.
  - C, R, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""slant"" -> S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)
  - L is in position 2 (since in ""slant"", L is at position 2 and marked ✓).
  - S and T are not in the word.
  - Now the pattern is: _ L A N _

Guess 3: ""blank"" -> B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)
  - B is not in the word (x).
  - L, A, N are correct in their positions (positions 2, 3, 4).
  - K is marked ✓, but note that in ""blank"", K is at position 5. So K is correct at position 5.

Therefore, the feedback from guess 3 tells us:
- B is not in the word (eliminated).
- K is correct at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word is: ? L A N K
  Specifically: position 1: ?, position 2: L, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: K.
  So the word ends with ""K"", making it: _ L A N K

- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, B (from previous feedbacks).

We need to find a word that matches the pattern: [letter] L A N K

The first letter must be a letter not eliminated and not used in previous guesses (except L, A, N, K which are confirmed).

Available letters: We must use a letter for position 1 that hasn't been eliminated and isn't L, A, N, K (which are already placed).

Eliminated: C, E, R, S, T, B

The word is almost solved: we have "" L A N K"" at positions 2-5, so we only need the first letter.

Possible letters for position 1: All letters except the eliminated ones and except L, A, N, K (but L,A,N,K are already placed elsewhere, so they can't be in position 1 unless duplicated? But feedback hasn't shown any duplicates so far).

Check for duplicates: In feedback, when we guessed words, we only had one instance marked per position. For example, in ""blank"", B was x and others were ✓. Similarly, no '-' for duplicate, so likely no duplicates.

Therefore, the first letter must be a new letter, not eliminated and not previously used? Actually, the letters we have used and not eliminated are L, A, N, K? But we can reuse letters? No, in Wordle, duplicates can exist, but in this case, we don't have evidence.

Given the feedback:
- In ""crane"": only A and N were correct at positions 3 and 4? If there were duplicates, we might have seen extra '-' for letters that are in the word but not in position. For example, if the word had two A's, and we put A at a wrong position, we'd get '-'. But in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and got ✓, so if there were another A, and we didn't put it elsewhere, we wouldn't see it? Similarly, in ""slant"" and ""blank"", we put L, A, N in the correct positions? And no duplicate marks? So it's likely no duplicates.

Thus, the first letter must be a consonant (probably) that we haven't tried yet.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word: ? L A N K

What words end with ""LANK""? 
- ""blank"" was already guessed? But we guessed it, and feedback showed B(x) but K(✓) so the word is not ""blank""? Because B was wrong? And K was right? So the word has K at the end? So it must be a word ending with ""LANK"", with a letter that is not B? And not eliminated.

Common words:
- ""plank"": P L A N K
- ""flank"": F L A N K
- ""clank"": but C eliminated? So not.
- ""slank"": S eliminated? Not.
- ""trunk"": Doesn't match pattern? No, we need L A N.

""plank"" and ""flank"" are both valid? Also ""alank""? Not common. Or ""glank""? Not common? Not real word.

So realistic possibilities: 
- plank (with P at position 1)
- flank (with F at position 1)

Other options? ""blink"" but that has I? Positions? ""blink"" is B L I N K -> not A at position 3? Our word has A at position 3? So not.

Therefore, we have two candidates: ""plank"" and ""flank"".

We have used P? Not? We haven't guessed P? Or F? So both are available.

We need to test one of them? But we have only one guess? Actually, we are on guess 4? We started with guess 1: crane, 2: slant, 3: blank? Now guess 4.

We can guess either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Let's pick one? And hope it's correct? Or is there a better guess that can distinguish? But we only have two possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? Since we get 6 tries? So we can guess one? If it's wrong, then we know the other? But we don't want to waste a guess? But there is no way to test both with one? Because we don't have a word that would include extra letters? We have to test one of them?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both F and P? But that might be inefficient? But our pattern is fixed? Positions 2-5 are known? So we cannot change them? We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5? And only position 1 varies? So our guess must be either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Or other rare words? But probably not.

So I think we should guess ""plank""? Because P is a common letter? Or ""flank""? Both are equally common? We can arbitrarily pick one.

But note: from ""blank"", we had B x? So not B? So ""plank"" or ""flank""?

Let me guess ""plank""? Or to be systematic? We can guess ""flank"" to test F? Same difference.

But we don't have information on F? We have to pick one? So let's guess ""plank"".

So guess: ""plank""

If it's wrong, then we know it's ""flank""? And we use guess 5.

But let me confirm: word ""plank"": P L A N K? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)? Yes.

Similarly, ""flank"": F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)

So now, I'll guess ""plank"".

But in the feedback for ""blank"", we saw K(✓) at position 5? So yes.

So <guess>plank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Pattern**: The word must be in the form ? L A N K, where position 2 is L, position 3 is A, position 4 is N, and position 5 is K (confirmed in Guess 3).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, E, S, T, B (marked 'x' in feedback).
- **Known positions**: Only position 1 (first letter) is unknown. Given the common English words fitting this pattern, the only plausible candidates are:
  - **plank**: P at position 1
  - **flank**: F at position 1

To solve efficiently, we prioritize testing one of these candidates. ""Plank"" is a common word and tests the letter P, which has not been guessed yet. If incorrect, the solution must be ""flank"", allowing for a logical next guess.

So ""giant"" seems a good candidate.\n\nOther possibilities: \n- ""FLAWN""? Not common. \n- ""DAINT""? Rare.\n\nHow about ""SAINT"": S(1), A(2)? Wait, SAINT: S-A-I-N-T. Then position 1:S, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T. Here A is at position 2, not position 3. But we need A at position 3? So that wouldn\'t have A in third? But we know from feedback that A is at position 3? Yes, because in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and it was correct.\n\nTherefore, we must have a word with A at position 3 and N at position 4.\n\nSo ""SAINT"" has A at position 2? No: \nC-R-A-N-E: positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\nSimilarly, SAINT: S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so A is at 2, I at 3, N at 4.\n\nBut we need A at 3 and N at 4? So in ""SAINT"", if we guess it, then A would be at position 2? Which isn\'t the correct place (we know it\'s position 3). Similarly, N is at 4, which is correct.\n\nBut for our guess, we want to test other positions? We are not constrained to having A and N in the same positions? Actually, we know A must be at position 3 and N at 4, so if we put A at position 2 in a guess, we will get \'-\' if it were in the word elsewhere, but we know it\'s only at position 3? So if we put A at a wrong position, we\'ll get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But we know A is only present at position 3? Not necessarily, but we only found one A? The feedback for ""crane"" showed one A as correct, but if the word had two A\'s, and one was in position 3 and another elsewhere, then when we put an A in another position we would get a \'-\'. But we have no evidence of that.\n\nBut to be safe, we can avoid putting A and N in wrong positions because we know they are fixed? Actually, putting them in wrong positions might help detect duplicates? But since we don\'t know, let\'s try to keep them in the correct positions so that we can focus on other letters.\n\nSo ideally, for the second guess, let\'s use a word that has:\n- A in position 3\n- N in position 4\n- And new letters in positions 1,2,5.\n\nAnd avoid C, R, E.\n\nSo candidate words? \n""GIANT"": G(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> uses G,I,T. All new.\n\nOther words:\n""PAINT"": P(1), A(2)? P-A-I-N-T: positions? P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> A is at position 2, not 3. So not.\n\n""GRANT"": G(1), R(2)? But R is eliminated? We cannot use R.\n\n""DRAIN"": same, has R.\n\n""QUANT"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> Q and U are less common, but possible? But we don\'t know.\n\n""SLANT"": S(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> S,L,T are new.\n\nAnother: ""PLANT"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), T(5) -> but we don\'t know if P, L, T are used.\n\nAmong these, ""SLANT"" or ""GIANT"" or ""PLANT""?\n\nWe want to use common letters? T is common, S is common, L is common, etc.\n\nAlso, we should avoid letters that might be eliminated? For example, we don\'t know about them yet.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MAINS""? But that ends with S? And has M,A,I,N,S? Positions: M(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), S(5) -> again, A is at pos 2? Not 3.\n\nWe need specifically ...A in third and ...N in fourth.\n\nSo the words must have the form: [letter][letter]AN[letter]\n\nPossible words: \n- Giant, Slant, Plant, Quart? (Quart is 4 letters? ""QUANT"" might be acceptable? But it\'s less common.)\n\n""BALMY""? Not pattern.\n\n""WANLY""? W(1), A(2), N(3)? But we need A at 3? And N at 4? So no.\n\nCommon words: \n- PLANT: P-L-A-N-T -> yes, A at 3, N at 4.\n- SLANT: S-L-A-N-T\n- GIANT: G-I-A-N-T\n- SHANT: not common.\n\nAlso, ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> I at 3? Not A? So no.\n\nWe must have A at pos 3.\n\nSo I think ""GIANT"", ""SLANT"", ""PLANT"" are good choices.\n\nLet me pick ""SLANT"" because S and L are very common.\n\nBut let\'s see which letters we can cover.\n\nIn ""GIANT"", we test G, I, T.\nIn ""SLANT"", we test S, L, T.\nBoth test T at the end? Position 5.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is not E? Because E was eliminated. So T is a good candidate.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests vowels? Because in positions 1 and 2, if we can test a vowel? In ""SLANT"", L is a consonant, S consonant. In ""GIANT"", I is a vowel (or a consonant?) I is a vowel. So ""GIANT"" has one vowel I, while ""SLANT"" has no vowels? A is vowel? But we already have A. So position 1 and 2 can be consonants or vowels.\n\nWe don\'t know what else is in the word? So it\'s fine.\n\nBut we might want to cover different letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TAINT""? T(1), A(2)? No, we need A at 3? T-A-I-N-T: A at 2.\n\n""STAIN"": S(1), T(2), A(3)? ...S-T-A-I-N: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) -> then N is at 5, not 4? So not.\n\n""TRAIN"": has R.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SLANT"" for example? Or ""GIANT""?\n\nI think ""GIANT"" is a bit risky? But we don\'t know. Alternatively, let\'s consider ""BAITS""? Doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSince we need the fifth letter? We can also consider words that end with different letters.\n\nBut let\'s go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut make sure: We cannot use E? And S,L are new.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""SLANT"".\n\nFeedback from ""crane"": only A and N were correct? And C,R,E wrong. So using S,L,T is safe? We don\'t know about them.\n\nSo I think ""SLANT"" is a good guess.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have A and N? But wait, if we don\'t put A at position 3, we might get \'-\' if A is elsewhere? But we don\'t expect that? Because we know A is at position 3? So if we put A at another position, we might get \'-\', meaning A is somewhere else? But we know it\'s at position 3? So we will see if the word has another A? That could be useful? But let\'s see.\n\nFor example, suppose we guess ""SAINT"": \n- S at position 1: could be correct or not?\n- A at position 2: we know the word has A but at position 3? So this A at 2 would get \'-\' if there\'s no duplicate? Because the only A is at position 3? So we\'ll get A marked as \'-\'? And I at position 3: might be new? N at position 4: ✓? T at position 5: ?\n\nThat way we could test more letters? But we are repeating A and N? And possibly testing S and I and T.\n\nBut let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: Keep A and N at positions: then in ""GIANT"" or ""SLANT"", we expect ✓ for A and N? And then feedback for G,I,T? Or S,L,T.\n\nOption 2: Use a word that moves them? For example, ""SAINT"": \n- We put A at position 2? Then since actual A is at position 3, we might get A as \'-\'? Then I at position 3? Then N at position 4 ✓? T at position 5.\n\nBut so we\'d get feedback on S, A (positioning), I, N (should be ✓), T.\n\nBy doing this, we can confirm that there\'s no duplicate A? Because if there were, we might get two \'-\' or something, but we don\'t have that? Actually, feedback marks the occurrences correctly. But here, since we put A at position 2, and the correct one is at position 3, we should get \'-\' for A, and then the position 3 gets I? So we get feedback on I? Then if I is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also, by placing A at position 2, we might get a \'-\' which confirms the existence of an A? But we already know that? So it might not be as efficient? Plus, we use the known letter in a wrong position? It could help if we suspect duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nSo I think the first option is more efficient? Because we know A and N positions? So we can fix them and focus on the others.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SLANT"".\n\nBut let me think of another word? What about ""PAINT""? Wait, but P-A-I-N-T: A is at position 2, so not correct? We need A at 3? So not.\n\nAnother word: ""BLAND""? B-L-A-N-D -> B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). That works? And D is new.\n\nBut that has D? Which is also good.\n\nOf course, we have many choices.\n\nBut ""SLANT"" seems fine? Or ""GLAND""? G-L-A-N-D.\n\nBut I\'ll stick with ""SLANT"" for commonality.\n\nSo guess: ""slant""\n\nBut let me write it: S-L-A-N-T\n\nWe are using S,L,T? Which are common.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R not in word, A correct at position 3, N correct at position 4, E not in word), we know:\n- The secret word has \'A\' at position 3 and \'N\' at position 4 (pattern: _ _ A N _).\n- C, R, and E are eliminated — they are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Focus on positions 1, 2, and 5.\n- Use new letters to maximize information, avoiding C, R, E.\n- Common words fitting the pattern _ _ A N _ include ""slant"", ""giant"", and ""plant"". ""Slant"" uses S (common consonant), L (common consonant), and T (common at word-end), providing broad coverage.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""slant"".\n\n<guess>slant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)\n- N: ✓ (correct, position 4)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""slant""\n- S: x (not in word)\n- L: ✓ (correct, position 2)  [since in ""slant"", L is at position 2, and it\'s marked correct, so the secret word has L at position 2]\n- A: ✓ (correct, position 3) [as before]\n- N: ✓ (correct, position 4) [as before]\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has L at position 2, A at position 3, and N at position 4. So the pattern is: _ L A N _\n- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T (from both guesses, since both x means not in word)\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: [letter1] L A N [letter5]\n\nWe know letter1 and letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but so far we haven\'t encountered any.\n\nWe need to choose a word for the third guess. We can try to use common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nLetters eliminated: C, E, R, S, T\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we need to form a word of the form ? L A N ?\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PLAN"" + something? But it must be 5 letters: so ""PLANE"" but E is eliminated -> not possible.\n- ""BLAND"": B L A N D -> but that\'s 5 letters? B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). And D is not eliminated? So ""BLAND"" is a candidate.\n- ""GLAND"": G L A N D -> similarly, G and D available.\n- ""FLANK"": F L A N K -> F and K available.\n- ""CLANK"": but C is eliminated, so no.\n- ""PLANK"": P L A N K -> P and K available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nWe can also think of ""ALONG""? But ""ALONG"" is A(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), G(5) -> but we need A at position 3? Here A is at 1, which is not correct. And position 3 is O? So no.\n\nWe must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n- ""BLAND"" (if we consider it common)\n- ""GLAND""\n- ""FLANK""\n- ""PLANK""\n- ""SLANG"" but S is eliminated? S is not allowed.\n- ""BLANK"": B L A N K -> B and K available.\n\nAlso, ""CLAMP"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""ELAND"" but E is eliminated.\n\nSo we have: BLAND, GLAND, FLANK, PLANK, BLANK, etc.\n\nNow, for our guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we also want to get closer to the solution.\n\nWe know the pattern is _ L A N _\n\nWe can try ""BLANK"" to test B and K? Or ""PLANK"" to test P and K.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has a fifth letter that we haven\'t guessed? We need to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tried? For example, vowels? We haven\'t tested O, U, I? But in the pattern, position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But in the words above, we have consonants.\n\nIs there a word like ""OLIAN""? Not a word.\n\n""ULNAE""? But that has U and E? E eliminated, and positions: U(1), L(2), N(3)? Not A at 3? No.\n\nSo probably, the common words are with consonants at 1 and 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALANE""? But A at position 1? And E eliminated? Not.\n\nSo let\'s pick one that tests two new letters? For example, ""PLANK"" tests P and K? Or ""BLAND"" tests B and D.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one is more likely? We can choose based on frequency.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we might want to guess a word that could be the solution? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has multiple possibilities? But we have to choose one.\n\nLet me think: after this guess, we might get more information.\n\nWe can also consider that the fifth letter might be a vowel? But in the pattern, it\'s the last letter? Words ending with a vowel? But many words end with consonants.\n\nFor example, ""koan"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n""lanai"" is L at 1? Not.\n\nSo I think ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""FLANK"", ""GLAND"", etc. are the main options.\n\nNow, from the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""blank"" as a guess? It uses B and K, both new.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""bland"" is also valid.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: B is more common than P? Or K? Not sure.\n\nWe can also think of ""clans"" but C eliminated and S eliminated? And it ends with S? But we need 5th letter? ""clans"" is 5 letters: C L A N S? But C and S eliminated? So no.\n\nSo I think ""blank"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s write it: B L A N K\n\nWe are testing B at position 1 and K at position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that B is correct? Then we know the first letter? Similarly for K.\n\nIf not, we eliminate them.\n\nBut we might also get partial matches? But since we are putting them in specific positions, we\'ll see.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""blank"".\n\nBut wait, we have ""flank"" as well? F and K.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""blank"".\n\nAlternatively, to cover a vowel? We don\'t have a vowel in the new positions? But we know A is there? And we haven\'t tested other vowels? But in this pattern, the vowels are fixed? Position 1 and 5 can be vowels? But we don\'t have a word? For example, ""ilium"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo I think ""blank"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s check the previous feedback: we have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4? So the word is ? L A N ?\n\nGuess: ""blank""\n\n<guess>blank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(not in word), R(not in word), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), E(not in word)\n- **Guess 2: ""slant""** → S(not in word), L(correct position 2), A(correct position 3), N(correct position 4), T(not in word)\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **`_ L A N _`** (L in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4).\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): **C, E, R, S, T**.\n- Remaining letters to test: All letters except C, E, R, S, T (focus on common consonants like B, D, F, G, K, P, etc., as vowels are less likely in positions 1 and 5 for this pattern).\n- Possible words fitting the pattern include ""blank"", ""flank"", ""plank"", ""bland"", or ""gland"". ""Blank"" is chosen to test new common letters (B and K) and could be a potential solution.\n\n### Reasoning for the Guess:\n- ""Blank"" fits the pattern `_ L A N _` with B in position 1 and K in position 5.\n- B and K are high-frequency consonants not yet tested, providing valuable information:\n  - If B is correct, it confirms position 1.\n  - If K is correct, it confirms position 5.\n  - If either is marked as present but wrong position (e.g., `-`), it indicates a duplicate letter or a different position (though duplicates are less likely based on prior feedback).\n- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while avoiding eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>blank</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)\n  - A is in position 3, N in position 4.\n  - C, R, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""slant"" -> S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)\n  - L is in position 2 (since in ""slant"", L is at position 2 and marked ✓).\n  - S and T are not in the word.\n  - Now the pattern is: _ L A N _\n\nGuess 3: ""blank"" -> B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)\n  - B is not in the word (x).\n  - L, A, N are correct in their positions (positions 2, 3, 4).\n  - K is marked ✓, but note that in ""blank"", K is at position 5. So K is correct at position 5.\n\nTherefore, the feedback from guess 3 tells us:\n- B is not in the word (eliminated).\n- K is correct at position 5.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word is: ? L A N K\n  Specifically: position 1: ?, position 2: L, position 3: A, position 4: N, position 5: K.\n  So the word ends with ""K"", making it: _ L A N K\n\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, B (from previous feedbacks).\n\nWe need to find a word that matches the pattern: [letter] L A N K\n\nThe first letter must be a letter not eliminated and not used in previous guesses (except L, A, N, K which are confirmed).\n\nAvailable letters: We must use a letter for position 1 that hasn\'t been eliminated and isn\'t L, A, N, K (which are already placed).\n\nEliminated: C, E, R, S, T, B\n\nThe word is almost solved: we have "" L A N K"" at positions 2-5, so we only need the first letter.\n\nPossible letters for position 1: All letters except the eliminated ones and except L, A, N, K (but L,A,N,K are already placed elsewhere, so they can\'t be in position 1 unless duplicated? But feedback hasn\'t shown any duplicates so far).\n\nCheck for duplicates: In feedback, when we guessed words, we only had one instance marked per position. For example, in ""blank"", B was x and others were ✓. Similarly, no \'-\' for duplicate, so likely no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the first letter must be a new letter, not eliminated and not previously used? Actually, the letters we have used and not eliminated are L, A, N, K? But we can reuse letters? No, in Wordle, duplicates can exist, but in this case, we don\'t have evidence.\n\nGiven the feedback:\n- In ""crane"": only A and N were correct at positions 3 and 4? If there were duplicates, we might have seen extra \'-\' for letters that are in the word but not in position. For example, if the word had two A\'s, and we put A at a wrong position, we\'d get \'-\'. But in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and got ✓, so if there were another A, and we didn\'t put it elsewhere, we wouldn\'t see it? Similarly, in ""slant"" and ""blank"", we put L, A, N in the correct positions? And no duplicate marks? So it\'s likely no duplicates.\n\nThus, the first letter must be a consonant (probably) that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nCommon letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut it must form a word: ? L A N K\n\nWhat words end with ""LANK""? \n- ""blank"" was already guessed? But we guessed it, and feedback showed B(x) but K(✓) so the word is not ""blank""? Because B was wrong? And K was right? So the word has K at the end? So it must be a word ending with ""LANK"", with a letter that is not B? And not eliminated.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""plank"": P L A N K\n- ""flank"": F L A N K\n- ""clank"": but C eliminated? So not.\n- ""slank"": S eliminated? Not.\n- ""trunk"": Doesn\'t match pattern? No, we need L A N.\n\n""plank"" and ""flank"" are both valid? Also ""alank""? Not common. Or ""glank""? Not common? Not real word.\n\nSo realistic possibilities: \n- plank (with P at position 1)\n- flank (with F at position 1)\n\nOther options? ""blink"" but that has I? Positions? ""blink"" is B L I N K -> not A at position 3? Our word has A at position 3? So not.\n\nTherefore, we have two candidates: ""plank"" and ""flank"".\n\nWe have used P? Not? We haven\'t guessed P? Or F? So both are available.\n\nWe need to test one of them? But we have only one guess? Actually, we are on guess 4? We started with guess 1: crane, 2: slant, 3: blank? Now guess 4.\n\nWe can guess either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Let\'s pick one? And hope it\'s correct? Or is there a better guess that can distinguish? But we only have two possibilities? And we have 3 guesses left? Since we get 6 tries? So we can guess one? If it\'s wrong, then we know the other? But we don\'t want to waste a guess? But there is no way to test both with one? Because we don\'t have a word that would include extra letters? We have to test one of them?\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses both F and P? But that might be inefficient? But our pattern is fixed? Positions 2-5 are known? So we cannot change them? We must have L at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5? And only position 1 varies? So our guess must be either ""plank"" or ""flank""? Or other rare words? But probably not.\n\nSo I think we should guess ""plank""? Because P is a common letter? Or ""flank""? Both are equally common? We can arbitrarily pick one.\n\nBut note: from ""blank"", we had B x? So not B? So ""plank"" or ""flank""?\n\nLet me guess ""plank""? Or to be systematic? We can guess ""flank"" to test F? Same difference.\n\nBut we don\'t have information on F? We have to pick one? So let\'s guess ""plank"".\n\nSo guess: ""plank""\n\nIf it\'s wrong, then we know it\'s ""flank""? And we use guess 5.\n\nBut let me confirm: word ""plank"": P L A N K? Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""flank"": F(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5)\n\nSo now, I\'ll guess ""plank"".\n\nBut in the feedback for ""blank"", we saw K(✓) at position 5? So yes.\n\nSo <guess>plank</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:\n\n- **Pattern**: The word must be in the form ? L A N K, where position 2 is L, position 3 is A, position 4 is N, and position 5 is K (confirmed in Guess 3).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, E, S, T, B (marked \'x\' in feedback).\n- **Known positions**: Only position 1 (first letter) is unknown. Given the common English words fitting this pattern, the only plausible candidates are:\n  - **plank**: P at position 1\n  - **flank**: F at position 1\n\nTo solve efficiently, we prioritize testing one of these candidates. ""Plank"" is a common word and tests the letter P, which has not been guessed yet. If incorrect, the solution must be ""flank"", allowing for a logical next guess.\n\n<guess>plank</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: slant -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: blank -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓)\nGuess 4: plank -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)  
  - This showed A at position 3 and N at position 4 are correct. Eliminated C, R, E.

Guess 2: ""slant"" -> S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - L is correct at position 2. Eliminated S and T.  
  - Pattern so far: L at 2, A at 3, N at 4 → _ L A N _

Guess 3: ""blank"" -> B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)  
  - K is correct at position 5. Eliminated B.  
  - Pattern: ? L A N K

Guess 4: ""plank"" -> P(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)  
  - Eliminated P.  
  - Feedback confirms L, K in positions 2 and 5 still correct (as expected). 

Now we know:  
- The word is * L A N K, with positions 2,3,4,5 locked: L, A, N, K.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, B, P.  
- The unknown is only position 1 (first letter).

Considering the pattern: the word must start with a letter not eliminated. Must be a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ""LANK"":
- ""flank"" (F) — F not eliminated yet.
- Others? ""clank"" (C eliminated), ""slank"" (S eliminated), ""blank"" (B eliminated), ""plank"" (P eliminated).

Therefore, the only probable candidate is ""flank"".

Verify:
- ""flank"": F at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. F is not eliminated.

Thus, we guess ""flank"" as it is the sole remaining common word.

Final structure:
- Position 1: Not eliminated? F is available and not tested.

So, guess ""flank"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be in the form `_ L A N K`, with positions 2–5 confirmed as L, A, N, K respectively (per Guess 3).
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: C, R, E (from Guess 1), S, T (from Guess 2), B (from Guess 3), and P (from Guess 4). Total: **C, R, E, S, T, B, P**.
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 (the first letter) remains unresolved.

Given the pattern and eliminated letters, the only plausible English word fitting `_ L A N K` is **""flank""**, with F at position 1. F has not been eliminated in prior guesses and is a common consonant. This guess will either solve the puzzle or confirm if duplicates or edge cases exist (though unlikely based on feedback).

<guess>flank</guess>",flank,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)  
  - This showed A at position 3 and N at position 4 are correct. Eliminated C, R, E.

Guess 2: ""slant"" -> S(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - L is correct at position 2. Eliminated S and T.  
  - Pattern so far: L at 2, A at 3, N at 4 → _ L A N _

Guess 3: ""blank"" -> B(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)  
  - K is correct at position 5. Eliminated B.  
  - Pattern: ? L A N K

Guess 4: ""plank"" -> P(x), L(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓)  
  - Eliminated P.  
  - Feedback confirms L, K in positions 2 and 5 still correct (as expected). 

Now we know:  
- The word is * L A N K, with positions 2,3,4,5 locked: L, A, N, K.  
- Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, B, P.  
- The unknown is only position 1 (first letter).

Considering the pattern: the word must start with a letter not eliminated. Must be a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ""LANK"":
- ""flank"" (F) — F not eliminated yet.
- Others? ""clank"" (C eliminated), ""slank"" (S eliminated), ""blank"" (B eliminated), ""plank"" (P eliminated).

Therefore, the only probable candidate is ""flank"".

Verify:
- ""flank"": F at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, N at 4, K at 5. F is not eliminated.

Thus, we guess ""flank"" as it is the sole remaining common word.

Final structure:
- Position 1: Not eliminated? F is available and not tested.

So, guess ""flank"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be in the form `_ L A N K`, with positions 2–5 confirmed as L, A, N, K respectively (per Guess 3).
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: C, R, E (from Guess 1), S, T (from Guess 2), B (from Guess 3), and P (from Guess 4). Total: **C, R, E, S, T, B, P**.
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 (the first letter) remains unresolved.

Given the pattern and eliminated letters, the only plausible English word fitting `_ L A N K` is **""flank""**, with F at position 1. F has not been eliminated in prior guesses and is a common consonant. This guess will either solve the puzzle or confirm if duplicates or edge cases exist (though unlikely based on feedback).",Guess 5: flank -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) L(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
