First, I need to recall the game rules and the feedback from the previous guess.

The secret word is 5 letters long, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. I started with ""CRANE"", and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, E is in the word and it's in the fifth position. That means the secret word ends with E.

Since C, R, A, N are all not in the word, I need to avoid using these letters in my next guess.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N

Letters that are confirmed: E is in position 5.

E is the last letter, so the secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

Now, I need to choose a new 5-letter word that ends with E and doesn't contain C, R, A, or N.

It should include other common letters to gather more information.

Common vowels: Since A is out, remaining vowels are O, I, U. A is not in the word, so maybe I should consider other vowels.

E is already used, but it could appear elsewhere? The feedback shows E only in position 5 with a ✓, but it doesn't say that E isn't elsewhere. Since the feedback marks each position separately, it's possible that E could be in the word multiple times, but since only position 5 is marked correct and others would be marked if present, in this case, for ""CRANE"", only E got a ✓, others got x, meaning C, R, A, N are absent, and E is only at the end. If E were elsewhere, it might show up as '-' for wrong position, but here it didn't. So E is only in position 5, not duplicated.

For example, if the word was ""APPLE"" and I guessed ""EAGLE"", feedback might show first E as not present or? In this system, it's per position. Since only one E was in the guess and it matched position, and others got x, it confirms E is only at the end and not elsewhere.

Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓). So no E is indicated elsewhere because there's only one E in the guess. But it doesn't preclude multiple E's in the secret word. However, since I only guessed one E, I don't know about other positions. But for now, I assume E is only at position 5 since no conflicting feedback.

I can't assume E isn't duplicated unless I have evidence. But in my next guess, I should consider that possibility.

Now, I need to pick a word that ends with E and uses letters not in the exclusion list: C, R, A, N are out.

Available letters: let's list English consonants and vowels.

Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are—E is in, but only position known; A is not in).

A is not in the word, from the feedback.

Similarly, consonants: B, D, F, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I need to use common ones.

A good strategy is to use a word with varied letters to cover more ground.

Perhaps start with something like ""SLATE"" or similar, but S and L might be good.

But S, L, T, etc.

But E is fixed at the end.

So my word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, since A is not in the word, I should avoid A.

Similarly, vowels to consider: O, I, U.

Also, consonant clusters.

Let me think of common words ending with E.

For example: HOUSE, MOUSE, BLUFF, but BLUFF is 6 letters? No, 5-letter words.

5-letter words: like STYLE, PRIDE, GUIDE, etc.

But need English words.

Possible words: TIMES, LINES, but LINES has N, which is out since N, and R, etc., but N is excluded.

N is not in the word, from feedback.

Similarly, LINES contains N, which is bad.

Avoid letters C, R, A, N.

So, letters excluded: C, R, A, N.

Available: B, D, E (only at end), F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? X,Q less common.

Now, E is placed, so for other positions, I need letters that are not excluded.

Perhaps use S, T, L, P, etc. commonly.

For my next guess, I want to to test several vowels and common consonants.

Since E is fixed, I can focus on the first four positions.

I should try to include O, I, U to test vowels.

Also, consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

List: available vowels: O, I, U (A and E are known—E in, A out)

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,Y,Z — avoid C,R,A,N.

Q is less common, so maybe not.

Good starting letters.

A word like ""QUOTE"" but Q might not be good, and O,U are vowels.

""QUOTE"" – Q,U,O,T,E. But E is at end, which is good.

Q might not be common, but it's valid. But perhaps better to avoid rare letters.

""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E – ends with E, letters: H,O,U,S – none in excluded list? Excluded are C,R,A,N. H,O,U,S are all not excluded.

H is not excluded, O not, U not, S not.

Similarly, E is fixed.

"" HOUSE"" sounds good.

But let's confirm: ""HOUSE"" – H O U S E

Position: 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E

Compared to secret word ending with E.

No C,R,A,N used.

After feedback from ""CRANE"", I know E is last, and C,R,A,N not in word.

But in ""HOUSE"", there is S, which might be good to test.

Another option: ""MOUSE"" – M O U S E, but M is also available.

M not excluded.

""SOULE"" – not common.

""APPLE"" has A, excluded.

""TABLE"" has A, excluded.

""EAGLE"" but it starts with E, but E is in position 1, but we know E is at position 5, so if I guess a word starting with E, it might get '-' if E is elsewhere, but in this case, I don't think E is elsewhere probably.

For now, avoid guessing E in other positions since it might confuse, but I need to test if E is duplicated or not.

In this feedback, since only position 5 has E correct, positions 1-4 didn't have E, so if E were in other positions, and I guessed a word with E elsewhere, it might show.

But to save moves, perhaps assume no duplication for now.

"" SLIME"" – S L I M E, letters S,L,I,M – I is vowel, L and M consonants.

All good.

"" TIMER"" has R, excluded.

R is excluded.

"" GUIDE"" – G U I D E, letters G,U,I,D – D is consonant, U and I vowels.

""GUISE"" – G U I S E

Also good.

To maximize vowel coverage, ""OUPHE"" is rare; better to use common words.

""HOUSE"" is fine.

""PHONE"" has P,H,O,N,E – but N is excluded, N is in ""PHONE"", which is bad, since N not in word.

PHONE has N, so avoid.

""SHINE"" has S,H,I,N,E – N excluded, no.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M E S – S is not excluded? T,I,M,S.

TIMES: T,I,M,E,S – positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:S,5:E

Letters: T, I, M, S – all not excluded.

C,R,A,N are excluded, yes.

T,I,M,S are available.

""TIMES"" is a good one.

""LINES"" has N, excluded.

So ""TIMES"" or ""HOUSE""?

""HOUSE"" has O,U,S,E,H.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M,E,S.

Both test different sets.

""TIMES"" has I and M, while ""HOUSE"" has O and U.

Since I know E is at end, I should focus on consonants for the first part or vowels.

Perhaps use ""SLATE"" but it has A, excluded.

A is not in word.

So, let's go with ""TIMES"".

A common word ending with E with good letters.

""PRIDE"" has R, excluded.

R not in word.

""SMILE"" has S,M,I,L,E – L is good.

""WHILE"" has W,H,I,L,E.

All could work.

I think ""TIMES"" is fine.

But let's pick ""HOUSE"" to test O and U, which might be less common, but still.

Since A and E are handled—E known, A out, so test I,O,U.

""TIMES"" tests I, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U.

Perhaps ""HOUSE"" is better because it tests two new vowels: O and U.

""HOUSE"": positions: H, O, U, S, E

After guessing, I'll get feedback on H, O, U, S in relation to the secret word.

Similarly, S is a common consonant.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" doesn't end with E and has A.

Must end with E.

""JUICE"" – J,U,I,C,E – C is excluded? C is not required to be excluded? C is excluded? In previous feedback, C was x, meaning C not in word.

From ""CRANE"" feedback: C(x), so C is not in the secret word.

Similarly R not, A not, N not.

So in ""JUICE"", C is excluded, so bad.

""QUIET"" ends with T, not E.

So words must end with E for this guess, since E is correct position.

I can guess any word, not necessarily ending with E, but since E is confirmed at position 5, guessing a word without E at end might waste a position or give information, but better to confirm E or test other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to fix known positions once confirmed.

So probably better to keep E at position 5.

For example, if I guess ""STOMP"", it ends with P, not E, and position 5 would be incorrect, but I might get feedback that E is only at end or something, but since E is ✓ in position 5, it must be there, so guessing without E at end would likely have position 5 wrong.

For instance, secret ""BRISK"" example, but now I have E at 5, so if I, say, guess ""APPLE"", position 5 E would be ✓, and for others.

But in my case, to test other letters efficiently.

Since I have many unknowns, it might be faster to go with a word that ends with E.

Thus, ""HOUSE"" or ""TIMES"".

Let me choose ""HOUSE"" because it uses O and U, both vowels not tested yet.

Also S is common.

So I'll go with H O U S E.

Word: HOUSE

After guessing, I'll see feedback.

So for the response, I need to output in the format.

Thought process is done? I think I have reasoned it.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"", I know the following:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For my next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word ending with E to maintain the known position of E.
- I must avoid using C, R, A, or N to eliminate excluded letters.
- I should prioritize testing new vowels and common consonants to gather more information, as only E's position is confirmed. Vowels not yet tested are O, I, and U, and common consonants worth exploring include H, S, T, L, M, etc.
- A good word choice is ""HOUSE"" because:
  - It ends with E.
  - It uses entirely new letters: H, O, U, S (no C, R, A, N).
  - It tests three new positions (1-4) and includes O and U, which are untested vowels, as well as S, a common consonant.
- This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and positions efficiently.

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For my next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word ending with E to maintain the known position of E.
- I must avoid using C, R, A, or N to eliminate excluded letters.
- I should prioritize testing new vowels and common consonants to gather more information, as only E's position is confirmed. Vowels not yet tested are O, I, and U, and common consonants worth exploring include H, S, T, L, M, etc.
- A good word choice is ""HOUSE"" because:
  - It ends with E.
  - It uses entirely new letters: H, O, U, S (no C, R, A, N).
  - It tests three new positions (1-4) and includes O and U, which are untested vowels, as well as S, a common consonant.
- This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and positions efficiently.",Guess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SPITE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recall the game rules and the feedback from the previous guess.

The secret word is 5 letters long, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. I started with ""CRANE"", and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, E is in the word and it's in the fifth position. That means the secret word ends with E.

Since C, R, A, N are all not in the word, I need to avoid using these letters in my next guess.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N

Letters that are confirmed: E is in position 5.

E is the last letter, so the secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

Now, I need to choose a new 5-letter word that ends with E and doesn't contain C, R, A, or N.

It should include other common letters to gather more information.

Common vowels: Since A is out, remaining vowels are O, I, U. A is not in the word, so maybe I should consider other vowels.

E is already used, but it could appear elsewhere? The feedback shows E only in position 5 with a ✓, but it doesn't say that E isn't elsewhere. Since the feedback marks each position separately, it's possible that E could be in the word multiple times, but since only position 5 is marked correct and others would be marked if present, in this case, for ""CRANE"", only E got a ✓, others got x, meaning C, R, A, N are absent, and E is only at the end. If E were elsewhere, it might show up as '-' for wrong position, but here it didn't. So E is only in position 5, not duplicated.

For example, if the word was ""APPLE"" and I guessed ""EAGLE"", feedback might show first E as not present or? In this system, it's per position. Since only one E was in the guess and it matched position, and others got x, it confirms E is only at the end and not elsewhere.

Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓). So no E is indicated elsewhere because there's only one E in the guess. But it doesn't preclude multiple E's in the secret word. However, since I only guessed one E, I don't know about other positions. But for now, I assume E is only at position 5 since no conflicting feedback.

I can't assume E isn't duplicated unless I have evidence. But in my next guess, I should consider that possibility.

Now, I need to pick a word that ends with E and uses letters not in the exclusion list: C, R, A, N are out.

Available letters: let's list English consonants and vowels.

Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are—E is in, but only position known; A is not in).

A is not in the word, from the feedback.

Similarly, consonants: B, D, F, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I need to use common ones.

A good strategy is to use a word with varied letters to cover more ground.

Perhaps start with something like ""SLATE"" or similar, but S and L might be good.

But S, L, T, etc.

But E is fixed at the end.

So my word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, since A is not in the word, I should avoid A.

Similarly, vowels to consider: O, I, U.

Also, consonant clusters.

Let me think of common words ending with E.

For example: HOUSE, MOUSE, BLUFF, but BLUFF is 6 letters? No, 5-letter words.

5-letter words: like STYLE, PRIDE, GUIDE, etc.

But need English words.

Possible words: TIMES, LINES, but LINES has N, which is out since N, and R, etc., but N is excluded.

N is not in the word, from feedback.

Similarly, LINES contains N, which is bad.

Avoid letters C, R, A, N.

So, letters excluded: C, R, A, N.

Available: B, D, E (only at end), F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? X,Q less common.

Now, E is placed, so for other positions, I need letters that are not excluded.

Perhaps use S, T, L, P, etc. commonly.

For my next guess, I want to to test several vowels and common consonants.

Since E is fixed, I can focus on the first four positions.

I should try to include O, I, U to test vowels.

Also, consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

List: available vowels: O, I, U (A and E are known—E in, A out)

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,Y,Z — avoid C,R,A,N.

Q is less common, so maybe not.

Good starting letters.

A word like ""QUOTE"" but Q might not be good, and O,U are vowels.

""QUOTE"" – Q,U,O,T,E. But E is at end, which is good.

Q might not be common, but it's valid. But perhaps better to avoid rare letters.

""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E – ends with E, letters: H,O,U,S – none in excluded list? Excluded are C,R,A,N. H,O,U,S are all not excluded.

H is not excluded, O not, U not, S not.

Similarly, E is fixed.

"" HOUSE"" sounds good.

But let's confirm: ""HOUSE"" – H O U S E

Position: 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E

Compared to secret word ending with E.

No C,R,A,N used.

After feedback from ""CRANE"", I know E is last, and C,R,A,N not in word.

But in ""HOUSE"", there is S, which might be good to test.

Another option: ""MOUSE"" – M O U S E, but M is also available.

M not excluded.

""SOULE"" – not common.

""APPLE"" has A, excluded.

""TABLE"" has A, excluded.

""EAGLE"" but it starts with E, but E is in position 1, but we know E is at position 5, so if I guess a word starting with E, it might get '-' if E is elsewhere, but in this case, I don't think E is elsewhere probably.

For now, avoid guessing E in other positions since it might confuse, but I need to test if E is duplicated or not.

In this feedback, since only position 5 has E correct, positions 1-4 didn't have E, so if E were in other positions, and I guessed a word with E elsewhere, it might show.

But to save moves, perhaps assume no duplication for now.

"" SLIME"" – S L I M E, letters S,L,I,M – I is vowel, L and M consonants.

All good.

"" TIMER"" has R, excluded.

R is excluded.

"" GUIDE"" – G U I D E, letters G,U,I,D – D is consonant, U and I vowels.

""GUISE"" – G U I S E

Also good.

To maximize vowel coverage, ""OUPHE"" is rare; better to use common words.

""HOUSE"" is fine.

""PHONE"" has P,H,O,N,E – but N is excluded, N is in ""PHONE"", which is bad, since N not in word.

PHONE has N, so avoid.

""SHINE"" has S,H,I,N,E – N excluded, no.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M E S – S is not excluded? T,I,M,S.

TIMES: T,I,M,E,S – positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:S,5:E

Letters: T, I, M, S – all not excluded.

C,R,A,N are excluded, yes.

T,I,M,S are available.

""TIMES"" is a good one.

""LINES"" has N, excluded.

So ""TIMES"" or ""HOUSE""?

""HOUSE"" has O,U,S,E,H.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M,E,S.

Both test different sets.

""TIMES"" has I and M, while ""HOUSE"" has O and U.

Since I know E is at end, I should focus on consonants for the first part or vowels.

Perhaps use ""SLATE"" but it has A, excluded.

A is not in word.

So, let's go with ""TIMES"".

A common word ending with E with good letters.

""PRIDE"" has R, excluded.

R not in word.

""SMILE"" has S,M,I,L,E – L is good.

""WHILE"" has W,H,I,L,E.

All could work.

I think ""TIMES"" is fine.

But let's pick ""HOUSE"" to test O and U, which might be less common, but still.

Since A and E are handled—E known, A out, so test I,O,U.

""TIMES"" tests I, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U.

Perhaps ""HOUSE"" is better because it tests two new vowels: O and U.

""HOUSE"": positions: H, O, U, S, E

After guessing, I'll get feedback on H, O, U, S in relation to the secret word.

Similarly, S is a common consonant.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" doesn't end with E and has A.

Must end with E.

""JUICE"" – J,U,I,C,E – C is excluded? C is not required to be excluded? C is excluded? In previous feedback, C was x, meaning C not in word.

From ""CRANE"" feedback: C(x), so C is not in the secret word.

Similarly R not, A not, N not.

So in ""JUICE"", C is excluded, so bad.

""QUIET"" ends with T, not E.

So words must end with E for this guess, since E is correct position.

I can guess any word, not necessarily ending with E, but since E is confirmed at position 5, guessing a word without E at end might waste a position or give information, but better to confirm E or test other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to fix known positions once confirmed.

So probably better to keep E at position 5.

For example, if I guess ""STOMP"", it ends with P, not E, and position 5 would be incorrect, but I might get feedback that E is only at end or something, but since E is ✓ in position 5, it must be there, so guessing without E at end would likely have position 5 wrong.

For instance, secret ""BRISK"" example, but now I have E at 5, so if I, say, guess ""APPLE"", position 5 E would be ✓, and for others.

But in my case, to test other letters efficiently.

Since I have many unknowns, it might be faster to go with a word that ends with E.

Thus, ""HOUSE"" or ""TIMES"".

Let me choose ""HOUSE"" because it uses O and U, both vowels not tested yet.

Also S is common.

So I'll go with H O U S E.

Word: HOUSE

After guessing, I'll see feedback.

So for the response, I need to output in the format.

Thought process is done? I think I have reasoned it.Based on the previous feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"", I know the following:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For my next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word ending with E to maintain the known position of E.
- I must avoid using C, R, A, or N to eliminate excluded letters.
- I should prioritize testing new vowels and common consonants to gather more information, as only E's position is confirmed. Vowels not yet tested are O, I, and U, and common consonants worth exploring include H, S, T, L, M, etc.

  - It tests three new positions (1-4) and includes O and U, which are untested vowels, as well as S, a common consonant.
- This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and positions efficiently.

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: 
- E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""house"" → Feedback: H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (it could be in positions 1,2,3). Since position 4 was S in ""house"", it must be elsewhere.
- H, O, U are not in the word at all.
- E is still ✓ in position 5, confirmed.

Now, combining all information:
- Known letters: E (position 5) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U (not in the word).
- Positions: We know S is not in position 4.

The secret word is _ _ _ _ E, with S in one of positions 1,2,3.

Available letters: We need to choose from remaining letters not excluded. Excluded so far are C,R,A,N,H,O,U.

Letters that could be in the word: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But S is already confirmed present.

Since S is in the word but not position 4, and E at position 5, we need to find words ending in E that have S in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid H,O,U,C,R,A,N.

Also, the word must be valid English.

We need to test other letters. Since S is known, we can focus on placing S and finding other letters.

A good strategy: Try a word that uses S in a different position and tests new common letters.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3.

For example:
- If S is at position 1: words like S_ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ S _ _ E
- Position 3: _ _ S _ E

We also need to cover other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Since only two letters are known (S and E), and many are excluded, we have fewer to choose from.

List of available common letters: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y.

Q,X,Y,Z are less common, so focus on B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W.

Vowels left: I is available (since A,O,U out, E is in).

So important to test I, as it's the only vowel left, or Y can sometimes act as vowel.

But E is already in, so secret word has E and possibly another vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

Possible words:

Let me think of words ending in E containing S not in position 4.

For position 1: e.g., ""SLATE"" but excluded A -> bad.
""SMILE"": S M I L E
This uses S(position1), M,I,L,E. Letters S,M,I,L are all still available? S is known present, M,I,L not tested yet.

But feedback: S is -, meaning not position4 in ""house"", so for ""smile"" position1 might be correct or not.

Similarly, position1 possibility.

Another: ""STYLE"" : S T Y L E, again S position1.

Position 2: e.g., ""ASI E"" no A excluded; ""US I E"" U excluded. So words with _ S _ _ E, e.g., ""PSYCH"" not 5 letters; ""ASSET"" has S at 2 and 3, but A excluded; ""ISSUE"" I S S U E, but U is excluded, so no.

""BAS I E"" A excluded.

"" MUS I E"" M U S I E, U excluded.

Hard to find _ S _ _ E without A,U,O,R.

Possible: ""W I S E"" but only 4 letters; 5-letter: e.g., ""RAISE"" A excluded; "" NOISE"" O excluded.

So few options? Perhaps ""EX I S E"" not common word.

Better way: Think of common words.

Perhaps position 3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PUR S E"" U excluded; ""CAUSE"" A,U? C A U S E - multiple exclusions.

"" VERSE"" E R S E - R excluded? R in ""verse"" is position 1? ""VERSE"": V E R S E — position1:V,2:E, but E is already at position5? If V E R S E, E is at position2 and5, but in secret word E is at5, so only position5 E is fixed; position2 could have E or not? But E is present only at5? From first guess, in ""crane"", E was correct at5, and no other E, but it could have another E? For example, secret word could have E at position2 also? But in ""crane"", we guessed E only at position5 and it was correct, but positions 1-4 were C,R,A,N all wrong and exluded, no E elsewhere in guess. So secret word might have E elsewhere? We don't know yet. In ""house"", we have E at5 correct, and U at position3, but U was x, so not there. But E could be in other positions if not guessed.

To test if E is duplicated, I need to guess a word with E elsewhere.

But let's assume for simplicity that E is only at position5 to save guesses, but I should test.

Since S is ""-"" in position4 for ""house"", and secret word has S somewhere else, and E at5.

Possible words: let's think ""S L I P E"" SLIPE; not common. Slide? S L I D E, ends with E? SLIDE - S L I D E, yes.

Letters: S,L,I,D. L,D are available.

Also ""SMITE"" : S M I T E

Or ""SHIRE"" but H excluded.

""SMILE"" : S M I L E

""SPIKE"" : S P I K E

All good.

Now for position2, _ S _ _ E: e.g., "" O S I E R"" not 5 letters; ""ASI A N"" not E; difficult. ""ASSET"" A excluded; ""MESSY"" not E; "" ESSEX"" but X, and not standard.

Perhaps "" L I S T E"" = literate shortened? No, usually LIST. But LIST is 4 letters. LISTE not English word.

Accepted words: perhaps ""ISLE"" 4 letters. Or ""AISLE"" 5 letters but starts with A excluded.

So few words with S in position2 without A,U,O.

""USAGE"" U excluded.

So probably rare, so focus on S in position1 or 3.

For position3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PURSE"" U excluded; ""course"" C,O,U excluded; ""VERSE"" V E R S E — E at position2, R is excluded.

R not in word.

""TERSE"" T E R S E — E at2, R excluded.

""PARSE"" P A R S E — A and R excluded.

""NURSE"" N U R S E — N,U,R excluded.

""WORSE"" W O R S E — O,R excluded.

""MERSE""? Not word.

""ELSE"" E L S E, but 4 letters; 5-letters: "" P U L S E"" U excluded; ""W H I S E"" not; ""P R I S E"" P R I S E, R excluded.

""RAISE"" R,A excluded.

""ARISE"" A,R excluded.

Hard to find.

Perhaps "" D W I N D L E "" too long.

Another idea: "" A W A K E "" A excluded.

Perhaps S in position1 is easier.

For example: ""S L I D E"" , ""S L I M E"" , ""S P I K E"" , etc.

Or ""S T I L E"" , ""S M I L E"" , etc.

Now, I also need to test the vowel I, as it's the only one left besides E.

Similarly, consonants like T, L, M, P, etc.

For my guess, I can choose ""SMILE"": S M I L E

- Position1 S: could be correct or not, since S is somewhere in 1,2,3.
- If S is at position1, it might be ✓, else if not, '-' or 'x'. But S is present, so if not correct position, would be '-'.

Similarly, positions 2:M, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E

Letters tested: M, I, L

All new.

Another option: ""SPILE"", ""STILE"", etc.

""SMILE"" is common.

But I need to avoid guessing L in position4 if possible? Position4 is unknown.

Since S was not at position4 in house, but it could be in 1,2,3.

In ""SMILE"", position4 is L, which is fine.

Let's see feedback possibilities.

Perhaps choose a word that uses S in a different position relative to previous.

For example, in ""house"" S was at position4, wrong, so now try position1 or 2 or 3.

I'll go with ""SMILE"".

But there's another thing: from ""house"", S is -, so S is in the word but not position4, and since position4 was S, it must be in 1,2, or3.

In ""SMILE"", putting S at position1 will test if S is at1.

Similarly, if not, S must be at2 or3.

Also, it tests I at position3.

So I think ""SMILE"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""TIMES"" but in ""TIMES"", T,I,M,E,S, but E is position4? ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:E,5:S

But secret word is _ _ _ _ E, ending with E, so if I guess ""TIMES"", position4 is E, which might be wrong position, since E is supposed to be at position5.

Position5 is S in ""TIMES"", which is not E, so it would be incorrect.

And E at position4 would be compared: since secret E is at position5, E at position4 in guess might be different.

For example, if I guess ""TIMES"", feedback for position4:E might be '-' if E is elsewhere but not position4, since E is at position5, so position4 E might be marked as absent if no E there? But E is in word only at5, so position4 E would be wrong, and marked as '-' or 'x'? Since E is not at position4, it would be 'x'? No.

If the secret E is only at position5, then:

- Position4 (E in ""TIMES"") is not correct, and since the letter E is in the word but at different position, it should be marked '-'.

But E is already known to be at position5, and we don't know if it's duplicated.

If secret has E only at position5, then E at position4 in guess would be '-'.

Position5 S would be 'x' since not E.

But E at position4 would be '-', meaning E is present elsewhere.

But ""elsewhere"" could be position5.

Similarly, for other positions.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to keep E at position5 until we know more.

So I should guess a word with E at position5.

Therefore, ""TIMES"" is not good because it doesn't end with E; it ends with S.

""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so position5 S.

I need a word like S M I L E or similar.

""SMILE"" ends with E.

Similarly, ""SLIME"", ""SPIKE"", etc.

Let's choose ""SMILE"": letters S,M,I,L,E.

S at position1, L at position4.

Position4 in ""house"" had S but marked '-' because it wasn't position4, now L is at position4.

This will test if L is in the word or not.

Similarly, M and I new.

I think good.

So guess ""SMILE"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (""house""): S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3. Also, H, O, U are not in the word. E remains confirmed at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

This means the secret word has:
- E at position 5.
- S somewhere in positions 1–3 (since not position 4).
- No C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E (to maintain E at position 5).
- Should avoid excluded letters and include S in one of positions 1–3 to test S's position.
- Should introduce new common letters, especially the vowel I (not tested yet), and consonants like M, L, D, etc., to maximize information.
- ""SMILE"" is a strong choice:
  - Fits the pattern: S at position 1, M at position 2, I at position 3, L at position 4, E at position 5.
  - Tests S in position 1 (could confirm or rule out), which helps narrow S's location if position 1 is incorrect (S must then be in position 2 or 3).
  - Tests new vowels (I) and consonants (M, L), which are common and could reveal more letters/positions.

This will provide feedback on:
- Whether S is in position 1 (✓ or -).
- Whether M, I, L are in the word and in correct positions (or not).

<guess>smile</guess>",smile,"We have two guesses and their feedback:
Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: 
- E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""house"" → Feedback: H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (it could be in positions 1,2,3). Since position 4 was S in ""house"", it must be elsewhere.
- H, O, U are not in the word at all.
- E is still ✓ in position 5, confirmed.

Now, combining all information:
- Known letters: E (position 5) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U (not in the word).
- Positions: We know S is not in position 4.

The secret word is _ _ _ _ E, with S in one of positions 1,2,3.

Available letters: We need to choose from remaining letters not excluded. Excluded so far are C,R,A,N,H,O,U.

Letters that could be in the word: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But S is already confirmed present.

Since S is in the word but not position 4, and E at position 5, we need to find words ending in E that have S in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid H,O,U,C,R,A,N.

Also, the word must be valid English.

We need to test other letters. Since S is known, we can focus on placing S and finding other letters.

A good strategy: Try a word that uses S in a different position and tests new common letters.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3.

For example:
- If S is at position 1: words like S_ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ S _ _ E
- Position 3: _ _ S _ E

We also need to cover other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Since only two letters are known (S and E), and many are excluded, we have fewer to choose from.

List of available common letters: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y.

Q,X,Y,Z are less common, so focus on B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W.

Vowels left: I is available (since A,O,U out, E is in).

So important to test I, as it's the only vowel left, or Y can sometimes act as vowel.

But E is already in, so secret word has E and possibly another vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

Possible words:

Let me think of words ending in E containing S not in position 4.

For position 1: e.g., ""SLATE"" but excluded A -> bad.
""SMILE"": S M I L E
This uses S(position1), M,I,L,E. Letters S,M,I,L are all still available? S is known present, M,I,L not tested yet.

But feedback: S is -, meaning not position4 in ""house"", so for ""smile"" position1 might be correct or not.

Similarly, position1 possibility.

Another: ""STYLE"" : S T Y L E, again S position1.

Position 2: e.g., ""ASI E"" no A excluded; ""US I E"" U excluded. So words with _ S _ _ E, e.g., ""PSYCH"" not 5 letters; ""ASSET"" has S at 2 and 3, but A excluded; ""ISSUE"" I S S U E, but U is excluded, so no.

""BAS I E"" A excluded.

"" MUS I E"" M U S I E, U excluded.

Hard to find _ S _ _ E without A,U,O,R.

Possible: ""W I S E"" but only 4 letters; 5-letter: e.g., ""RAISE"" A excluded; "" NOISE"" O excluded.

So few options? Perhaps ""EX I S E"" not common word.

Better way: Think of common words.

Perhaps position 3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PUR S E"" U excluded; ""CAUSE"" A,U? C A U S E - multiple exclusions.

"" VERSE"" E R S E - R excluded? R in ""verse"" is position 1? ""VERSE"": V E R S E — position1:V,2:E, but E is already at position5? If V E R S E, E is at position2 and5, but in secret word E is at5, so only position5 E is fixed; position2 could have E or not? But E is present only at5? From first guess, in ""crane"", E was correct at5, and no other E, but it could have another E? For example, secret word could have E at position2 also? But in ""crane"", we guessed E only at position5 and it was correct, but positions 1-4 were C,R,A,N all wrong and exluded, no E elsewhere in guess. So secret word might have E elsewhere? We don't know yet. In ""house"", we have E at5 correct, and U at position3, but U was x, so not there. But E could be in other positions if not guessed.

To test if E is duplicated, I need to guess a word with E elsewhere.

But let's assume for simplicity that E is only at position5 to save guesses, but I should test.

Since S is ""-"" in position4 for ""house"", and secret word has S somewhere else, and E at5.

Possible words: let's think ""S L I P E"" SLIPE; not common. Slide? S L I D E, ends with E? SLIDE - S L I D E, yes.

Letters: S,L,I,D. L,D are available.

Also ""SMITE"" : S M I T E

Or ""SHIRE"" but H excluded.

""SMILE"" : S M I L E

""SPIKE"" : S P I K E

All good.

Now for position2, _ S _ _ E: e.g., "" O S I E R"" not 5 letters; ""ASI A N"" not E; difficult. ""ASSET"" A excluded; ""MESSY"" not E; "" ESSEX"" but X, and not standard.

Perhaps "" L I S T E"" = literate shortened? No, usually LIST. But LIST is 4 letters. LISTE not English word.

Accepted words: perhaps ""ISLE"" 4 letters. Or ""AISLE"" 5 letters but starts with A excluded.

So few words with S in position2 without A,U,O.

""USAGE"" U excluded.

So probably rare, so focus on S in position1 or 3.

For position3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PURSE"" U excluded; ""course"" C,O,U excluded; ""VERSE"" V E R S E — E at position2, R is excluded.

R not in word.

""TERSE"" T E R S E — E at2, R excluded.

""RAISE"" R,A excluded.

""ARISE"" A,R excluded.

Hard to find.

Perhaps "" D W I N D L E "" too long.

Another idea: "" A W A K E "" A excluded.

Perhaps S in position1 is easier.

For example: ""S L I D E"" , ""S L I M E"" , ""S P I K E"" , etc.

Or ""S T I L E"" , ""S M I L E"" , etc.

Now, I also need to test the vowel I, as it's the only one left besides E.

Similarly, consonants like T, L, M, P, etc.

For my guess, I can choose ""SMILE"": S M I L E

- Position1 S: could be correct or not, since S is somewhere in 1,2,3.
- If S is at position1, it might be ✓, else if not, '-' or 'x'. But S is present, so if not correct position, would be '-'.

Similarly, positions 2:M, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E

Letters tested: M, I, L

All new.

Another option: ""SPILE"", ""STILE"", etc.

""SMILE"" is common.

But I need to avoid guessing L in position4 if possible? Position4 is unknown.

Since S was not at position4 in house, but it could be in 1,2,3.

In ""SMILE"", position4 is L, which is fine.

Let's see feedback possibilities.

Perhaps choose a word that uses S in a different position relative to previous.

For example, in ""house"" S was at position4, wrong, so now try position1 or 2 or 3.

I'll go with ""SMILE"".

But there's another thing: from ""house"", S is -, so S is in the word but not position4, and since position4 was S, it must be in 1,2, or3.

In ""SMILE"", putting S at position1 will test if S is at1.

Similarly, if not, S must be at2 or3.

Also, it tests I at position3.

So I think ""SMILE"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""TIMES"" but in ""TIMES"", T,I,M,E,S, but E is position4? ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:E,5:S

But secret word is _ _ _ _ E, ending with E, so if I guess ""TIMES"", position4 is E, which might be wrong position, since E is supposed to be at position5.

Position5 is S in ""TIMES"", which is not E, so it would be incorrect.

And E at position4 would be compared: since secret E is at position5, E at position4 in guess might be different.

For example, if I guess ""TIMES"", feedback for position4:E might be '-' if E is elsewhere but not position4, since E is at position5, so position4 E might be marked as absent if no E there? But E is in word only at5, so position4 E would be wrong, and marked as '-' or 'x'? Since E is not at position4, it would be 'x'? No.

If the secret E is only at position5, then:

- Position4 (E in ""TIMES"") is not correct, and since the letter E is in the word but at different position, it should be marked '-'.

But E is already known to be at position5, and we don't know if it's duplicated.

If secret has E only at position5, then E at position4 in guess would be '-'.

Position5 S would be 'x' since not E.

But E at position4 would be '-', meaning E is present elsewhere.

But ""elsewhere"" could be position5.

Similarly, for other positions.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to keep E at position5 until we know more.

So I should guess a word with E at position5.

Therefore, ""TIMES"" is not good because it doesn't end with E; it ends with S.

""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so position5 S.

I need a word like S M I L E or similar.

""SMILE"" ends with E.

Similarly, ""SLIME"", ""SPIKE"", etc.

Let's choose ""SMILE"": letters S,M,I,L,E.

S at position1, L at position4.

Position4 in ""house"" had S but marked '-' because it wasn't position4, now L is at position4.

This will test if L is in the word or not.

Similarly, M and I new.

I think good.

So guess ""SMILE"".After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (""house""): S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3. Also, H, O, U are not in the word. E remains confirmed at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

This means the secret word has:
- E at position 5.
- S somewhere in positions 1–3 (since not position 4).
- No C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E (to maintain E at position 5).
- Should avoid excluded letters and include S in one of positions 1–3 to test S's position.
- Should introduce new common letters, especially the vowel I (not tested yet), and consonants like M, L, D, etc., to maximize information.
- ""SMILE"" is a strong choice:

  - Tests new vowels (I) and consonants (M, L), which are common and could reveal more letters/positions.

This will provide feedback on:

- Whether M, I, L are in the word and in correct positions (or not).",Guess 3: smile -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SPITE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to recall the game rules and the feedback from the previous guess.

The secret word is 5 letters long, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. I started with ""CRANE"", and the feedback was:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, E is in the word and it's in the fifth position. That means the secret word ends with E.

Since C, R, A, N are all not in the word, I need to avoid using these letters in my next guess.

Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N

Letters that are confirmed: E is in position 5.

E is the last letter, so the secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

Now, I need to choose a new 5-letter word that ends with E and doesn't contain C, R, A, or N.

It should include other common letters to gather more information.

Common vowels: Since A is out, remaining vowels are O, I, U. A is not in the word, so maybe I should consider other vowels.

E is already used, but it could appear elsewhere? The feedback shows E only in position 5 with a ✓, but it doesn't say that E isn't elsewhere. Since the feedback marks each position separately, it's possible that E could be in the word multiple times, but since only position 5 is marked correct and others would be marked if present, in this case, for ""CRANE"", only E got a ✓, others got x, meaning C, R, A, N are absent, and E is only at the end. If E were elsewhere, it might show up as '-' for wrong position, but here it didn't. So E is only in position 5, not duplicated.

For example, if the word was ""APPLE"" and I guessed ""EAGLE"", feedback might show first E as not present or? In this system, it's per position. Since only one E was in the guess and it matched position, and others got x, it confirms E is only at the end and not elsewhere.

Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓). So no E is indicated elsewhere because there's only one E in the guess. But it doesn't preclude multiple E's in the secret word. However, since I only guessed one E, I don't know about other positions. But for now, I assume E is only at position 5 since no conflicting feedback.

I can't assume E isn't duplicated unless I have evidence. But in my next guess, I should consider that possibility.

Now, I need to pick a word that ends with E and uses letters not in the exclusion list: C, R, A, N are out.

Available letters: let's list English consonants and vowels.

Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are—E is in, but only position known; A is not in).

A is not in the word, from the feedback.

Similarly, consonants: B, D, F, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But I need to use common ones.

A good strategy is to use a word with varied letters to cover more ground.

Perhaps start with something like ""SLATE"" or similar, but S and L might be good.

But S, L, T, etc.

But E is fixed at the end.

So my word must be ? ? ? ? E.

Now, since A is not in the word, I should avoid A.

Similarly, vowels to consider: O, I, U.

Also, consonant clusters.

Let me think of common words ending with E.

For example: HOUSE, MOUSE, BLUFF, but BLUFF is 6 letters? No, 5-letter words.

5-letter words: like STYLE, PRIDE, GUIDE, etc.

But need English words.

Possible words: TIMES, LINES, but LINES has N, which is out since N, and R, etc., but N is excluded.

N is not in the word, from feedback.

Similarly, LINES contains N, which is bad.

Avoid letters C, R, A, N.

So, letters excluded: C, R, A, N.

Available: B, D, E (only at end), F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? X,Q less common.

Now, E is placed, so for other positions, I need letters that are not excluded.

Perhaps use S, T, L, P, etc. commonly.

For my next guess, I want to to test several vowels and common consonants.

Since E is fixed, I can focus on the first four positions.

I should try to include O, I, U to test vowels.

Also, consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

List: available vowels: O, I, U (A and E are known—E in, A out)

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,Y,Z — avoid C,R,A,N.

Q is less common, so maybe not.

Good starting letters.

A word like ""QUOTE"" but Q might not be good, and O,U are vowels.

""QUOTE"" – Q,U,O,T,E. But E is at end, which is good.

Q might not be common, but it's valid. But perhaps better to avoid rare letters.

""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E – ends with E, letters: H,O,U,S – none in excluded list? Excluded are C,R,A,N. H,O,U,S are all not excluded.

H is not excluded, O not, U not, S not.

Similarly, E is fixed.

"" HOUSE"" sounds good.

But let's confirm: ""HOUSE"" – H O U S E

Position: 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E

Compared to secret word ending with E.

No C,R,A,N used.

After feedback from ""CRANE"", I know E is last, and C,R,A,N not in word.

But in ""HOUSE"", there is S, which might be good to test.

Another option: ""MOUSE"" – M O U S E, but M is also available.

M not excluded.

""SOULE"" – not common.

""APPLE"" has A, excluded.

""TABLE"" has A, excluded.

""EAGLE"" but it starts with E, but E is in position 1, but we know E is at position 5, so if I guess a word starting with E, it might get '-' if E is elsewhere, but in this case, I don't think E is elsewhere probably.

For now, avoid guessing E in other positions since it might confuse, but I need to test if E is duplicated or not.

In this feedback, since only position 5 has E correct, positions 1-4 didn't have E, so if E were in other positions, and I guessed a word with E elsewhere, it might show.

But to save moves, perhaps assume no duplication for now.

"" SLIME"" – S L I M E, letters S,L,I,M – I is vowel, L and M consonants.

All good.

"" TIMER"" has R, excluded.

R is excluded.

"" GUIDE"" – G U I D E, letters G,U,I,D – D is consonant, U and I vowels.

""GUISE"" – G U I S E

Also good.

To maximize vowel coverage, ""OUPHE"" is rare; better to use common words.

""HOUSE"" is fine.

""PHONE"" has P,H,O,N,E – but N is excluded, N is in ""PHONE"", which is bad, since N not in word.

PHONE has N, so avoid.

""SHINE"" has S,H,I,N,E – N excluded, no.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M E S – S is not excluded? T,I,M,S.

TIMES: T,I,M,E,S – positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:S,5:E

Letters: T, I, M, S – all not excluded.

C,R,A,N are excluded, yes.

T,I,M,S are available.

""TIMES"" is a good one.

""LINES"" has N, excluded.

So ""TIMES"" or ""HOUSE""?

""HOUSE"" has O,U,S,E,H.

""TIMES"" has T,I,M,E,S.

Both test different sets.

""TIMES"" has I and M, while ""HOUSE"" has O and U.

Since I know E is at end, I should focus on consonants for the first part or vowels.

Perhaps use ""SLATE"" but it has A, excluded.

A is not in word.

So, let's go with ""TIMES"".

A common word ending with E with good letters.

""PRIDE"" has R, excluded.

R not in word.

""SMILE"" has S,M,I,L,E – L is good.

""WHILE"" has W,H,I,L,E.

All could work.

I think ""TIMES"" is fine.

But let's pick ""HOUSE"" to test O and U, which might be less common, but still.

Since A and E are handled—E known, A out, so test I,O,U.

""TIMES"" tests I, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U.

Perhaps ""HOUSE"" is better because it tests two new vowels: O and U.

""HOUSE"": positions: H, O, U, S, E

After guessing, I'll get feedback on H, O, U, S in relation to the secret word.

Similarly, S is a common consonant.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" doesn't end with E and has A.

Must end with E.

""JUICE"" – J,U,I,C,E – C is excluded? C is not required to be excluded? C is excluded? In previous feedback, C was x, meaning C not in word.

From ""CRANE"" feedback: C(x), so C is not in the secret word.

Similarly R not, A not, N not.

So in ""JUICE"", C is excluded, so bad.

""QUIET"" ends with T, not E.

So words must end with E for this guess, since E is correct position.

I can guess any word, not necessarily ending with E, but since E is confirmed at position 5, guessing a word without E at end might waste a position or give information, but better to confirm E or test other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to fix known positions once confirmed.

So probably better to keep E at position 5.

For example, if I guess ""STOMP"", it ends with P, not E, and position 5 would be incorrect, but I might get feedback that E is only at end or something, but since E is ✓ in position 5, it must be there, so guessing without E at end would likely have position 5 wrong.

For instance, secret ""BRISK"" example, but now I have E at 5, so if I, say, guess ""APPLE"", position 5 E would be ✓, and for others.

But in my case, to test other letters efficiently.

Since I have many unknowns, it might be faster to go with a word that ends with E.

Thus, ""HOUSE"" or ""TIMES"".

Let me choose ""HOUSE"" because it uses O and U, both vowels not tested yet.

Also S is common.

So I'll go with H O U S E.

Word: HOUSE

After guessing, I'll see feedback.

So for the response, I need to output in the format.

Thought process is done? I think I have reasoned it.Based on the previous feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"", I know the following:

- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.

For my next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word ending with E to maintain the known position of E.
- I must avoid using C, R, A, or N to eliminate excluded letters.
- I should prioritize testing new vowels and common consonants to gather more information, as only E's position is confirmed. Vowels not yet tested are O, I, and U, and common consonants worth exploring include H, S, T, L, M, etc.
- A good word choice is ""HOUSE"" because:
  - It ends with E.
  - It uses entirely new letters: H, O, U, S (no C, R, A, N).
  - It tests three new positions (1-4) and includes O and U, which are untested vowels, as well as S, a common consonant.
- This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and positions efficiently.

<guess>house</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:
Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: 
- E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""house"" → Feedback: H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (it could be in positions 1,2,3). Since position 4 was S in ""house"", it must be elsewhere.
- H, O, U are not in the word at all.
- E is still ✓ in position 5, confirmed.

Now, combining all information:
- Known letters: E (position 5) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U (not in the word).
- Positions: We know S is not in position 4.

The secret word is _ _ _ _ E, with S in one of positions 1,2,3.

Available letters: We need to choose from remaining letters not excluded. Excluded so far are C,R,A,N,H,O,U.

Letters that could be in the word: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But S is already confirmed present.

Since S is in the word but not position 4, and E at position 5, we need to find words ending in E that have S in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid H,O,U,C,R,A,N.

Also, the word must be valid English.

We need to test other letters. Since S is known, we can focus on placing S and finding other letters.

A good strategy: Try a word that uses S in a different position and tests new common letters.

Possible positions for S: 1,2,3.

For example:
- If S is at position 1: words like S_ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ S _ _ E
- Position 3: _ _ S _ E

We also need to cover other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Since only two letters are known (S and E), and many are excluded, we have fewer to choose from.

List of available common letters: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y.

Q,X,Y,Z are less common, so focus on B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W.

Vowels left: I is available (since A,O,U out, E is in).

So important to test I, as it's the only vowel left, or Y can sometimes act as vowel.

But E is already in, so secret word has E and possibly another vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

Possible words:

Let me think of words ending in E containing S not in position 4.

For position 1: e.g., ""SLATE"" but excluded A -> bad.
""SMILE"": S M I L E
This uses S(position1), M,I,L,E. Letters S,M,I,L are all still available? S is known present, M,I,L not tested yet.

But feedback: S is -, meaning not position4 in ""house"", so for ""smile"" position1 might be correct or not.

Similarly, position1 possibility.

Another: ""STYLE"" : S T Y L E, again S position1.

Position 2: e.g., ""ASI E"" no A excluded; ""US I E"" U excluded. So words with _ S _ _ E, e.g., ""PSYCH"" not 5 letters; ""ASSET"" has S at 2 and 3, but A excluded; ""ISSUE"" I S S U E, but U is excluded, so no.

""BAS I E"" A excluded.

"" MUS I E"" M U S I E, U excluded.

Hard to find _ S _ _ E without A,U,O,R.

Possible: ""W I S E"" but only 4 letters; 5-letter: e.g., ""RAISE"" A excluded; "" NOISE"" O excluded.

So few options? Perhaps ""EX I S E"" not common word.

Better way: Think of common words.

Perhaps position 3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PUR S E"" U excluded; ""CAUSE"" A,U? C A U S E - multiple exclusions.

"" VERSE"" E R S E - R excluded? R in ""verse"" is position 1? ""VERSE"": V E R S E — position1:V,2:E, but E is already at position5? If V E R S E, E is at position2 and5, but in secret word E is at5, so only position5 E is fixed; position2 could have E or not? But E is present only at5? From first guess, in ""crane"", E was correct at5, and no other E, but it could have another E? For example, secret word could have E at position2 also? But in ""crane"", we guessed E only at position5 and it was correct, but positions 1-4 were C,R,A,N all wrong and exluded, no E elsewhere in guess. So secret word might have E elsewhere? We don't know yet. In ""house"", we have E at5 correct, and U at position3, but U was x, so not there. But E could be in other positions if not guessed.

To test if E is duplicated, I need to guess a word with E elsewhere.

But let's assume for simplicity that E is only at position5 to save guesses, but I should test.

Since S is ""-"" in position4 for ""house"", and secret word has S somewhere else, and E at5.

Possible words: let's think ""S L I P E"" SLIPE; not common. Slide? S L I D E, ends with E? SLIDE - S L I D E, yes.

Letters: S,L,I,D. L,D are available.

Also ""SMITE"" : S M I T E

Or ""SHIRE"" but H excluded.

""SMILE"" : S M I L E

""SPIKE"" : S P I K E

All good.

Now for position2, _ S _ _ E: e.g., "" O S I E R"" not 5 letters; ""ASI A N"" not E; difficult. ""ASSET"" A excluded; ""MESSY"" not E; "" ESSEX"" but X, and not standard.

Perhaps "" L I S T E"" = literate shortened? No, usually LIST. But LIST is 4 letters. LISTE not English word.

Accepted words: perhaps ""ISLE"" 4 letters. Or ""AISLE"" 5 letters but starts with A excluded.

So few words with S in position2 without A,U,O.

""USAGE"" U excluded.

So probably rare, so focus on S in position1 or 3.

For position3: _ _ S _ E, e.g., ""PURSE"" U excluded; ""course"" C,O,U excluded; ""VERSE"" V E R S E — E at position2, R is excluded.

R not in word.

""TERSE"" T E R S E — E at2, R excluded.

""PARSE"" P A R S E — A and R excluded.

""NURSE"" N U R S E — N,U,R excluded.

""WORSE"" W O R S E — O,R excluded.

""MERSE""? Not word.

""ELSE"" E L S E, but 4 letters; 5-letters: "" P U L S E"" U excluded; ""W H I S E"" not; ""P R I S E"" P R I S E, R excluded.

""RAISE"" R,A excluded.

""ARISE"" A,R excluded.

Hard to find.

Perhaps "" D W I N D L E "" too long.

Another idea: "" A W A K E "" A excluded.

Perhaps S in position1 is easier.

For example: ""S L I D E"" , ""S L I M E"" , ""S P I K E"" , etc.

Or ""S T I L E"" , ""S M I L E"" , etc.

Now, I also need to test the vowel I, as it's the only one left besides E.

Similarly, consonants like T, L, M, P, etc.

For my guess, I can choose ""SMILE"": S M I L E

- Position1 S: could be correct or not, since S is somewhere in 1,2,3.
- If S is at position1, it might be ✓, else if not, '-' or 'x'. But S is present, so if not correct position, would be '-'.

Similarly, positions 2:M, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E

Letters tested: M, I, L

All new.

Another option: ""SPILE"", ""STILE"", etc.

""SMILE"" is common.

But I need to avoid guessing L in position4 if possible? Position4 is unknown.

Since S was not at position4 in house, but it could be in 1,2,3.

In ""SMILE"", position4 is L, which is fine.

Let's see feedback possibilities.

Perhaps choose a word that uses S in a different position relative to previous.

For example, in ""house"" S was at position4, wrong, so now try position1 or 2 or 3.

I'll go with ""SMILE"".

But there's another thing: from ""house"", S is -, so S is in the word but not position4, and since position4 was S, it must be in 1,2, or3.

In ""SMILE"", putting S at position1 will test if S is at1.

Similarly, if not, S must be at2 or3.

Also, it tests I at position3.

So I think ""SMILE"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""TIMES"" but in ""TIMES"", T,I,M,E,S, but E is position4? ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:E,5:S

But secret word is _ _ _ _ E, ending with E, so if I guess ""TIMES"", position4 is E, which might be wrong position, since E is supposed to be at position5.

Position5 is S in ""TIMES"", which is not E, so it would be incorrect.

And E at position4 would be compared: since secret E is at position5, E at position4 in guess might be different.

For example, if I guess ""TIMES"", feedback for position4:E might be '-' if E is elsewhere but not position4, since E is at position5, so position4 E might be marked as absent if no E there? But E is in word only at5, so position4 E would be wrong, and marked as '-' or 'x'? Since E is not at position4, it would be 'x'? No.

If the secret E is only at position5, then:

- Position4 (E in ""TIMES"") is not correct, and since the letter E is in the word but at different position, it should be marked '-'.

But E is already known to be at position5, and we don't know if it's duplicated.

If secret has E only at position5, then E at position4 in guess would be '-'.

Position5 S would be 'x' since not E.

But E at position4 would be '-', meaning E is present elsewhere.

But ""elsewhere"" could be position5.

Similarly, for other positions.

But to avoid confusion, it's better to keep E at position5 until we know more.

So I should guess a word with E at position5.

Therefore, ""TIMES"" is not good because it doesn't end with E; it ends with S.

""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so position5 S.

I need a word like S M I L E or similar.

""SMILE"" ends with E.

Similarly, ""SLIME"", ""SPIKE"", etc.

Let's choose ""SMILE"": letters S,M,I,L,E.

S at position1, L at position4.

Position4 in ""house"" had S but marked '-' because it wasn't position4, now L is at position4.

This will test if L is in the word or not.

Similarly, M and I new.

I think good.

So guess ""SMILE"".After analyzing the feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- From Guess 2 (""house""): S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3. Also, H, O, U are not in the word. E remains confirmed at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

This means the secret word has:
- E at position 5.
- S somewhere in positions 1–3 (since not position 4).
- No C, R, A, N, H, O, U.

For the next guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E (to maintain E at position 5).
- Should avoid excluded letters and include S in one of positions 1–3 to test S's position.
- Should introduce new common letters, especially the vowel I (not tested yet), and consonants like M, L, D, etc., to maximize information.
- ""SMILE"" is a strong choice:
  - Fits the pattern: S at position 1, M at position 2, I at position 3, L at position 4, E at position 5.
  - Tests S in position 1 (could confirm or rule out), which helps narrow S's location if position 1 is incorrect (S must then be in position 2 or 3).
  - Tests new vowels (I) and consonants (M, L), which are common and could reveal more letters/positions.

This will provide feedback on:
- Whether S is in position 1 (✓ or -).
- Whether M, I, L are in the word and in correct positions (or not).

No, 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words: like STYLE, PRIDE, GUIDE, etc.\n\nBut need English words.\n\nPossible words: TIMES, LINES, but LINES has N, which is out since N, and R, etc., but N is excluded.\n\nN is not in the word, from feedback.\n\nSimilarly, LINES contains N, which is bad.\n\nAvoid letters C, R, A, N.\n\nSo, letters excluded: C, R, A, N.\n\nAvailable: B, D, E (only at end), F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? X,Q less common.\n\nNow, E is placed, so for other positions, I need letters that are not excluded.\n\nPerhaps use S, T, L, P, etc. commonly.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to to test several vowels and common consonants.\n\nSince E is fixed, I can focus on the first four positions.\n\nI should try to include O, I, U to test vowels.\n\nAlso, consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.\n\nList: available vowels: O, I, U (A and E are known—E in, A out)\n\nConsonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,S,T,V,W,Y,Z — avoid C,R,A,N.\n\nQ is less common, so maybe not.\n\nGood starting letters.\n\nA word like ""QUOTE"" but Q might not be good, and O,U are vowels.\n\n""QUOTE"" – Q,U,O,T,E. But E is at end, which is good.\n\nQ might not be common, but it\'s valid. But perhaps better to avoid rare letters.\n\n""HOUSE"": H,O,U,S,E – ends with E, letters: H,O,U,S – none in excluded list? Excluded are C,R,A,N. H,O,U,S are all not excluded.\n\nH is not excluded, O not, U not, S not.\n\nSimilarly, E is fixed.\n\n"" HOUSE"" sounds good.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""HOUSE"" – H O U S E\n\nPosition: 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E\n\nCompared to secret word ending with E.\n\nNo C,R,A,N used.\n\nAfter feedback from ""CRANE"", I know E is last, and C,R,A,N not in word.\n\nBut in ""HOUSE"", there is S, which might be good to test.\n\nAnother option: ""MOUSE"" – M O U S E, but M is also available.\n\nM not excluded.\n\n""SOULE"" – not common.\n\n""APPLE"" has A, excluded.\n\n""TABLE"" has A, excluded.\n\n""EAGLE"" but it starts with E, but E is in position 1, but we know E is at position 5, so if I guess a word starting with E, it might get \'-\' if E is elsewhere, but in this case, I don\'t think E is elsewhere probably.\n\nFor now, avoid guessing E in other positions since it might confuse, but I need to test if E is duplicated or not.\n\nIn this feedback, since only position 5 has E correct, positions 1-4 didn\'t have E, so if E were in other positions, and I guessed a word with E elsewhere, it might show.\n\nBut to save moves, perhaps assume no duplication for now.\n\n"" SLIME"" – S L I M E, letters S,L,I,M – I is vowel, L and M consonants.\n\nAll good.\n\n"" TIMER"" has R, excluded.\n\nR is excluded.\n\n"" GUIDE"" – G U I D E, letters G,U,I,D – D is consonant, U and I vowels.\n\n""GUISE"" – G U I S E\n\nAlso good.\n\nTo maximize vowel coverage, ""OUPHE"" is rare; better to use common words.\n\n""HOUSE"" is fine.\n\n""PHONE"" has P,H,O,N,E – but N is excluded, N is in ""PHONE"", which is bad, since N not in word.\n\nPHONE has N, so avoid.\n\n""SHINE"" has S,H,I,N,E – N excluded, no.\n\n""TIMES"" has T,I,M E S – S is not excluded? T,I,M,S.\n\nTIMES: T,I,M,E,S – positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:S,5:E\n\nLetters: T, I, M, S – all not excluded.\n\nC,R,A,N are excluded, yes.\n\nT,I,M,S are available.\n\n""TIMES"" is a good one.\n\n""LINES"" has N, excluded.\n\nSo ""TIMES"" or ""HOUSE""?\n\n""HOUSE"" has O,U,S,E,H.\n\n""TIMES"" has T,I,M,E,S.\n\nBoth test different sets.\n\n""TIMES"" has I and M, while ""HOUSE"" has O and U.\n\nSince I know E is at end, I should focus on consonants for the first part or vowels.\n\nPerhaps use ""SLATE"" but it has A, excluded.\n\nA is not in word.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""TIMES"".\n\nA common word ending with E with good letters.\n\n""PRIDE"" has R, excluded.\n\nR not in word.\n\n""SMILE"" has S,M,I,L,E – L is good.\n\n""WHILE"" has W,H,I,L,E.\n\nAll could work.\n\nI think ""TIMES"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""HOUSE"" to test O and U, which might be less common, but still.\n\nSince A and E are handled—E known, A out, so test I,O,U.\n\n""TIMES"" tests I, ""HOUSE"" tests O and U.\n\nPerhaps ""HOUSE"" is better because it tests two new vowels: O and U.\n\n""HOUSE"": positions: H, O, U, S, E\n\nAfter guessing, I\'ll get feedback on H, O, U, S in relation to the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, S is a common consonant.\n\nAnother option: ""ABOUT"" doesn\'t end with E and has A.\n\nMust end with E.\n\n""JUICE"" – J,U,I,C,E – C is excluded? C is not required to be excluded? C is excluded? In previous feedback, C was x, meaning C not in word.\n\nFrom ""CRANE"" feedback: C(x), so C is not in the secret word.\n\nSimilarly R not, A not, N not.\n\nSo in ""JUICE"", C is excluded, so bad.\n\n""QUIET"" ends with T, not E.\n\nSo words must end with E for this guess, since E is correct position.\n\nI can guess any word, not necessarily ending with E, but since E is confirmed at position 5, guessing a word without E at end might waste a position or give information, but better to confirm E or test other positions.\n\nIn Wordle strategy, it\'s often good to fix known positions once confirmed.\n\nSo probably better to keep E at position 5.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""STOMP"", it ends with P, not E, and position 5 would be incorrect, but I might get feedback that E is only at end or something, but since E is ✓ in position 5, it must be there, so guessing without E at end would likely have position 5 wrong.\n\nFor instance, secret ""BRISK"" example, but now I have E at 5, so if I, say, guess ""APPLE"", position 5 E would be ✓, and for others.\n\nBut in my case, to test other letters efficiently.\n\nSince I have many unknowns, it might be faster to go with a word that ends with E.\n\nThus, ""HOUSE"" or ""TIMES"".\n\nLet me choose ""HOUSE"" because it uses O and U, both vowels not tested yet.\n\nAlso S is common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with H O U S E.\n\nWord: HOUSE\n\nAfter guessing, I\'ll see feedback.\n\nSo for the response, I need to output in the format.\n\nThought process is done? I think I have reasoned it.Based on the previous feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"", I know the following:\n\n- The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.\n- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor my next guess:\n- I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word ending with E to maintain the known position of E.\n- I must avoid using C, R, A, or N to eliminate excluded letters.\n- I should prioritize testing new vowels and common consonants to gather more information, as only E\'s position is confirmed. Vowels not yet tested are O, I, and U, and common consonants worth exploring include H, S, T, L, M, etc.\n- A good word choice is ""HOUSE"" because:\n  - It ends with E.\n  - It uses entirely new letters: H, O, U, S (no C, R, A, N).\n  - It tests three new positions (1-4) and includes O and U, which are untested vowels, as well as S, a common consonant.\n- This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters and positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>house</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\nGuess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning: \n- E is in the word and in position 5 (so the word ends with E).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""house"" → Feedback: H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the word but not in position 4 (it could be in positions 1,2,3). Since position 4 was S in ""house"", it must be elsewhere.\n- H, O, U are not in the word at all.\n- E is still ✓ in position 5, confirmed.\n\nNow, combining all information:\n- Known letters: E (position 5) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U (not in the word).\n- Positions: We know S is not in position 4.\n\nThe secret word is _ _ _ _ E, with S in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nAvailable letters: We need to choose from remaining letters not excluded.

Since S is known, we can focus on placing S and finding other letters.\n\nA good strategy: Try a word that uses S in a different position and tests new common letters.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1,2,3.\n\nFor example:\n- If S is at position 1: words like S_ _ _ E\n- Position 2: _ S _ _ E\n- Position 3: _ _ S _ E\n\nWe also need to cover other common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nSince only two letters are known (S and E), and many are excluded, we have fewer to choose from.\n\nList of available common letters: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y.\n\nQ,X,Y,Z are less common, so focus on B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,T,W.\n\nVowels left: I is available (since A,O,U out, E is in).\n\nSo important to test I, as it\'s the only vowel left, or Y can sometimes act as vowel.\n\nBut E is already in, so secret word has E and possibly another vowel?

From first guess, in ""crane"", E was correct at5, and no other E, but it could have another E? For example, secret word could have E at position2 also? But in ""crane"", we guessed E only at position5 and it was correct, but positions 1-4 were C,R,A,N all wrong and exluded, no E elsewhere in guess. So secret word might have E elsewhere? We don\'t know yet. In ""house"", we have E at5 correct, and U at position3, but U was x, so not there.

But S is present, so if not correct position, would be \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, positions 2:M, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E\n\nLetters tested: M, I, L\n\nAll new.\n\nAnother option: ""SPILE"", ""STILE"", etc.\n\n""SMILE"" is common.\n\nBut I need to avoid guessing L in position4 if possible? Position4 is unknown.\n\nSince S was not at position4 in house, but it could be in 1,2,3.\n\nIn ""SMILE"", position4 is L, which is fine.\n\nLet\'s see feedback possibilities.\n\nPerhaps choose a word that uses S in a different position relative to previous.\n\nFor example, in ""house"" S was at position4, wrong, so now try position1 or 2 or 3.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SMILE"".\n\nBut there\'s another thing: from ""house"", S is -, so S is in the word but not position4, and since position4 was S, it must be in 1,2, or3.\n\nIn ""SMILE"", putting S at position1 will test if S is at1.\n\nSimilarly, if not, S must be at2 or3.\n\nAlso, it tests I at position3.\n\nSo I think ""SMILE"" is a good guess.\n\nAnother word: ""TIMES"" but in ""TIMES"", T,I,M,E,S, but E is position4? ""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so positions:1:T,2:I,3:M,4:E,5:S\n\nBut secret word is _ _ _ _ E, ending with E, so if I guess ""TIMES"", position4 is E, which might be wrong position, since E is supposed to be at position5.\n\nPosition5 is S in ""TIMES"", which is not E, so it would be incorrect.\n\nAnd E at position4 would be compared: since secret E is at position5, E at position4 in guess might be different.\n\nFor example, if I guess ""TIMES"", feedback for position4:E might be \'-\' if E is elsewhere but not position4, since E is at position5, so position4 E might be marked as absent if no E there? But E is in word only at5, so position4 E would be wrong, and marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Since E is not at position4, it would be \'x\'? No.\n\nIf the secret E is only at position5, then:\n\n- Position4 (E in ""TIMES"") is not correct, and since the letter E is in the word but at different position, it should be marked \'-\'.\n\nBut E is already known to be at position5, and we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated.\n\nIf secret has E only at position5, then E at position4 in guess would be \'-\'.\n\nPosition5 S would be \'x\' since not E.\n\nBut E at position4 would be \'-\', meaning E is present elsewhere.\n\nBut ""elsewhere"" could be position5.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, it\'s better to keep E at position5 until we know more.\n\nSo I should guess a word with E at position5.\n\nTherefore, ""TIMES"" is not good because it doesn\'t end with E; it ends with S.\n\n""TIMES"" is T-I-M-E-S, so position5 S.\n\nI need a word like S M I L E or similar.\n\n""SMILE"" ends with E.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLIME"", ""SPIKE"", etc.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SMILE"": letters S,M,I,L,E.\n\nS at position1, L at position4.\n\nPosition4 in ""house"" had S but marked \'-\' because it wasn\'t position4, now L is at position4.\n\nThis will test if L is in the word or not.\n\nSimilarly, M and I new.\n\nI think good.\n\nSo guess ""SMILE"".After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed in position 5, and C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n- From Guess 2 (""house""): S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 3. Also, H, O, U are not in the word. E remains confirmed at position 5.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, H, O, U.\n\nThis means the secret word has:\n- E at position 5.\n- S somewhere in positions 1–3 (since not position 4).\n- No C, R, A, N, H, O, U.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter English word ending in E (to maintain E at position 5).\n- Should avoid excluded letters and include S in one of positions 1–3 to test S\'s position.\n- Should introduce new common letters, especially the vowel I (not tested yet), and consonants like M, L, D, etc., to maximize information.\n- ""SMILE"" is a strong choice:\n  - Fits the pattern: S at position 1, M at position 2, I at position 3, L at position 4, E at position 5.\n  - Tests S in position 1 (could confirm or rule out), which helps narrow S\'s location if position 1 is incorrect (S must then be in position 2 or 3).\n  - Tests new vowels (I) and consonants (M, L), which are common and could reveal more letters/positions.\n\nThis will provide feedback on:\n- Whether S is in position 1 (✓ or -).\n- Whether M, I, L are in the word and in correct positions (or not).\n\n<guess>smile</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: house -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(x) U(x) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: smile -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) I(✓) L(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""house"" → H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S is in one of positions 1, 2, or 3).
- H, O, U are not in the word.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Guess 3: ""smile"" → S(✓), M(x), I(✓), L(x), E(✓)
- S is in the correct position (position 1).
- I is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- M and L are not in the word.

Now, combining all information:

- Confirmed positions:
  - Position 1: S (from ""smile"" feedback: S(✓))
  - Position 3: I (from ""smile"" feedback: I(✓))
  - Position 5: E (consistent from all guesses)

- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: S _ I _ E

- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L (from the x's in feedback)

- We also know that S is at position 1, so it cannot be elsewhere (but we already have it fixed).

- Letters that are in the word but position unknown: None new, but we have two positions to fill: position 2 and position 4.

- We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S _ I _ E, where the second and fourth letters are from the remaining available letters, excluding the known absent letters.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. Excluded: C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L (9 letters). So available: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S is already used and fixed at position 1, and we know it's not duplicated (since if it were, it might have been indicated in previous feedback, but in ""house"" S was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, but now in ""smile"" S is at position 1 and correct, so S is only at position 1, not elsewhere. Similarly, in ""smile"", we have S at 1 and no other S, so no duplication issue).

Similarly, I is at position 3, and E at 5.

So for positions 2 and 4, we need to choose from available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

Common words of the form S _ I _ E:

- Possible options:
  - ""SPIKE"": S P I K E → positions: 2=P, 4=K
  - ""SPIRE"": S P I R E → but R is excluded (from guess 1)
  - ""SPITE"": S P I T E → 2=P, 4=T
  - ""STILE"": S T I L E → but L is excluded (from guess 3, L(x))
  - ""SMITE"": S M I T E → but M is excluded (from guess 3, M(x))
  - ""SHINE"": S H I N E → H and N excluded
  - ""SWIPE"": S W I P E → 2=W, 4=P
  - ""SNIPE"": S N I P E → N excluded
  - ""SLIME"": S L I M E → L and M excluded
  - ""SUITE"": S U I T E → U excluded
  - ""SMILE"": already guessed, and L and M excluded

Now, with available letters:

- ""SPIKE"": uses P and K, both available.
- ""SPITE"": uses P and T, both available.
- ""SWIPE"": uses W and P, both available. But ""SWIPE"" has positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E. So position 4 is P.
- ""STIPE"": S T I P E → 2=T, 4=P. ""Stipe"" is a word (part of a fungus).
- ""SIDE"" is 4 letters; need 5.

Other possibilities: ""SKITE"" (not common), ""SBITE"" not word.

""SPIKE"" and ""SPITE"" are common.

Also, ""SHIRE"" but H excluded.

""SKIVE"": S K I V E → 2=K, 4=V. ""Skive"" means to avoid work, valid.

""SWIVE"" archaic, not common.

""STIVE"" rare.

So best options: ""SPIKE"", ""SPITE"", ""SWIPE"", ""SKIVE"", etc.

We need to choose one that tests likely letters.

Since we have two positions, we can guess one and see.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6.

We can try to solve.

Another word: ""SIXTE"" not word; ""SIZ E"" no.

""SIRE"" 4 letters.

""BESIDE"" too long.

So focus on S _ I _ E.

Available letters for position 2: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

For position 4: same, but must form word.

Common: position 2 often vowels? But we have I at 3, so position 2 is consonant usually.

For example, in ""SPIKE"", position 2 is P (consonant), position 4 is K (consonant).

Similarly, ""SPITE"": P and T.

""SWIPE"": W and P.

""SKITE"": not common.

""STIPE"": T and P.

""SPIEL"" ends with L, not E.

""SPIEL"" is S P I E L, but ends with L, not E, so position 5 is L, but we need E at 5.

So not.

Therefore, the main options are ""SPIKE"", ""SPITE"", ""SWIPE"", and ""SKIVE"".

""SKIVE"" might be less common, so perhaps avoid.

""SPINE"" has N, excluded.

So between ""SPIKE"" and ""SPITE"", both are good.

""SPITE"" uses T, which is common.

Similarly, ""SPIKE"" uses K.

But we don't know which.

We could also consider ""SMILE"" was guessed, but M and L excluded.

Another idea: ""SUITE"" U excluded.

So I think ""SPITE"" is a solid choice.

But let's see if we can get more information.

We have to fill position 2 and 4.

If I guess ""SPITE"", for example:

- If correct, we win.

- If not, we get feedback on P and T.

Similarly for ""SPIKE"".

But since we have limited guesses, and ""SPITE"" is common, I'll go with that.

But we need to confirm the word.

Pattern S _ I _ E.

""SPITE"": S P I T E

Position 2: P, position 4: T.

Both P and T are not excluded, so possible.

Similarly, ""SPIKE"": S P I K E, position 2:P, 4:K.

Now, in terms of feedback, if I guess ""SPITE"", and it's wrong, I might get:

- Position 2: P could be ✓, -, or x

- Position 4: T similarly.

But since we know the pattern, and only two positions unknown, we can solve.

But let's list all possible words to see how many.

Possible S _ I _ E words with available letters:

Position 2: can be B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 4: same, but must form English word.

- With P at position 2: ""SPI E"" with 4th letter: need word like SPIRE (R excluded), SPIEL (ends L), so only if position 4 is T or K or etc.

""SPITE"", ""SPIKE"", ""SPIRE"" (excluded), ""SPINE"" (N excluded), ""SPIEL"" not E end.

So ""SPITE"" and ""SPIKE"" are the only common ones with P at 2.

""SPIV E"" not word.

With T at position 2: ""STI E"" like ""STILE"" (L excluded), ""STIME"" not common, ""STIRE"" not word, ""STIPE"" (S T I P E) which is a word.

""STIPE"" is valid.

""STIVE"" not common.

With K at position 2: ""SKI E"" like ""SKITE"" (not common), ""SKIVE"" (S K I V E), which is valid.

""SKIMO"" not.

With W at position 2: ""SWIPE"" (S W I P E), valid.

""SWIVE"" archaic.

With B: ""SBI E"" no words.

D: ""SDI E"" no.

F: ""SFI E"" no.

G: ""SGI E"" no.

J: ""SJI E"" no.

Q: ""SQI E"" no.

V: ""SVI E"" no.

X: ""SXI E"" no.

Y: ""SYLI E"" no, ""SYCE"" not 5 letters.

Z: ""SZI E"" no.

So the possible common words are:

- ""SPITE"" (P at 2, T at 4)
- ""SPIKE"" (P at 2, K at 4)
- ""STIPE"" (T at 2, P at 4)
- ""SKIVE"" (K at 2, V at 4)
- ""SWIPE"" (W at 2, P at 4)

And less common: ""SKITE"", etc.

Now, we have 5 possibilities, but we can eliminate with feedback.

In our guess, we can choose one that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""SPITE"", it covers P at position 2 and T at position 4.

If it's not correct, feedback will tell us about P and T.

Similarly.

Since S, I, E are fixed, and we have two positions, we might solve in one or two guesses.

But let's see the previous feedback doesn't have P or T, so we don't know.

I think ""SPITE"" is a good guess.

But in ""smile"", we had M and L excluded, but P and T are new.

Another word: ""SINCE"" but N excluded.

So I'll go with ""SPITE"".

But let's confirm the format.

Perhaps ""SWIPE"" to test W.

But ""SPITE"" is more common.

I think ""SPITE"" is fine.

So guess: SPITE

But in the response, we need to output.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have the following confirmed information:

- **Position 1**: S is correct (from ""smile"" feedback: S(✓)).
- **Position 3**: I is correct (from ""smile"" feedback: I(✓)).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (consistent across all guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), H, O, U (from ""house""), and M, L (from ""smile"") are not in the word.
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be of the form S _ I _ E, where the second and fourth positions need to be filled with letters not excluded.

The available letters for positions 2 and 4 are: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since S, I, and E are already placed and not duplicated).

Possible words fitting S _ I _ E include:
- ""SPITE"" (P at position 2, T at position 4)
- ""SPIKE"" (P at position 2, K at position 4)
- ""STIPE"" (T at position 2, P at position 4)
- ""SKIVE"" (K at position 2, V at position 4)
- ""SWIPE"" (W at position 2, P at position 4)

""SPITE"" is a strong guess because:
- It tests two common consonants (P and T) that haven't been tried yet.
- It is a high-frequency English word, increasing the likelihood of a solution or informative feedback.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether P or T is in the word and their positions, narrowing down the possibilities significantly.

<guess>spite</guess>",spite,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""house"" → H(x), O(x), U(x), S(-), E(✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S is in one of positions 1, 2, or 3).
- H, O, U are not in the word.
- E is confirmed at position 5.

Guess 3: ""smile"" → S(✓), M(x), I(✓), L(x), E(✓)
- S is in the correct position (position 1).
- I is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- M and L are not in the word.

Now, combining all information:

- Confirmed positions:
  - Position 1: S (from ""smile"" feedback: S(✓))
  - Position 3: I (from ""smile"" feedback: I(✓))
  - Position 5: E (consistent from all guesses)

- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: S _ I _ E

- Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L (from the x's in feedback)

- We also know that S is at position 1, so it cannot be elsewhere (but we already have it fixed).

- Letters that are in the word but position unknown: None new, but we have two positions to fill: position 2 and position 4.

- We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S _ I _ E, where the second and fourth letters are from the remaining available letters, excluding the known absent letters.

Available letters: We must avoid C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. Excluded: C, R, A, N, H, O, U, M, L (9 letters). So available: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But S is already used and fixed at position 1, and we know it's not duplicated (since if it were, it might have been indicated in previous feedback, but in ""house"" S was at position 4 and marked as present but wrong position, but now in ""smile"" S is at position 1 and correct, so S is only at position 1, not elsewhere. Similarly, in ""smile"", we have S at 1 and no other S, so no duplication issue).

Similarly, I is at position 3, and E at 5.

So for positions 2 and 4, we need to choose from available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid English word.

Common words of the form S _ I _ E:

- Possible options:
  - ""SPIKE"": S P I K E → positions: 2=P, 4=K
  - ""SPIRE"": S P I R E → but R is excluded (from guess 1)
  - ""SPITE"": S P I T E → 2=P, 4=T
  - ""STILE"": S T I L E → but L is excluded (from guess 3, L(x))
  - ""SMITE"": S M I T E → but M is excluded (from guess 3, M(x))
  - ""SHINE"": S H I N E → H and N excluded
  - ""SWIPE"": S W I P E → 2=W, 4=P
  - ""SNIPE"": S N I P E → N excluded
  - ""SLIME"": S L I M E → L and M excluded
  - ""SUITE"": S U I T E → U excluded
  - ""SMILE"": already guessed, and L and M excluded

Now, with available letters:

- ""SPIKE"": uses P and K, both available.
- ""SPITE"": uses P and T, both available.
- ""SWIPE"": uses W and P, both available. But ""SWIPE"" has positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E. So position 4 is P.
- ""STIPE"": S T I P E → 2=T, 4=P. ""Stipe"" is a word (part of a fungus).
- ""SIDE"" is 4 letters; need 5.

Other possibilities: ""SKITE"" (not common), ""SBITE"" not word.

""SPIKE"" and ""SPITE"" are common.

Also, ""SHIRE"" but H excluded.

""SKIVE"": S K I V E → 2=K, 4=V. ""Skive"" means to avoid work, valid.

""SWIVE"" archaic, not common.

""STIVE"" rare.

So best options: ""SPIKE"", ""SPITE"", ""SWIPE"", ""SKIVE"", etc.

We need to choose one that tests likely letters.

Since we have two positions, we can guess one and see.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6.

We can try to solve.

Another word: ""SIXTE"" not word; ""SIZ E"" no.

""SIRE"" 4 letters.

""BESIDE"" too long.

So focus on S _ I _ E.

Available letters for position 2: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,T,V,W,X,Y,Z

For position 4: same, but must form word.

Common: position 2 often vowels? But we have I at 3, so position 2 is consonant usually.

For example, in ""SPIKE"", position 2 is P (consonant), position 4 is K (consonant).

Similarly, ""SPITE"": P and T.

""SWIPE"": W and P.

""SKITE"": not common.

""STIPE"": T and P.

""SPIEL"" ends with L, not E.

""SPIEL"" is S P I E L, but ends with L, not E, so position 5 is L, but we need E at 5.

So not.

Therefore, the main options are ""SPIKE"", ""SPITE"", ""SWIPE"", and ""SKIVE"".

""SKIVE"" might be less common, so perhaps avoid.

""SPINE"" has N, excluded.

So between ""SPIKE"" and ""SPITE"", both are good.

""SPITE"" uses T, which is common.

Similarly, ""SPIKE"" uses K.

But we don't know which.

We could also consider ""SMILE"" was guessed, but M and L excluded.

Another idea: ""SUITE"" U excluded.

So I think ""SPITE"" is a solid choice.

But let's see if we can get more information.

We have to fill position 2 and 4.

If I guess ""SPITE"", for example:

- If correct, we win.

- If not, we get feedback on P and T.

Similarly for ""SPIKE"".

But since we have limited guesses, and ""SPITE"" is common, I'll go with that.

But we need to confirm the word.

Pattern S _ I _ E.

""SPITE"": S P I T E

Position 2: P, position 4: T.

Both P and T are not excluded, so possible.

Similarly, ""SPIKE"": S P I K E, position 2:P, 4:K.

Now, in terms of feedback, if I guess ""SPITE"", and it's wrong, I might get:

- Position 2: P could be ✓, -, or x

- Position 4: T similarly.

But since we know the pattern, and only two positions unknown, we can solve.

But let's list all possible words to see how many.

Possible S _ I _ E words with available letters:

Position 2: can be B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 4: same, but must form English word.

- With P at position 2: ""SPI E"" with 4th letter: need word like SPIRE (R excluded), SPIEL (ends L), so only if position 4 is T or K or etc.

""SPITE"", ""SPIKE"", ""SPIRE"" (excluded), ""SPINE"" (N excluded), ""SPIEL"" not E end.

So ""SPITE"" and ""SPIKE"" are the only common ones with P at 2.

""SPIV E"" not word.

With T at position 2: ""STI E"" like ""STILE"" (L excluded), ""STIME"" not common, ""STIRE"" not word, ""STIPE"" (S T I P E) which is a word.

""STIPE"" is valid.

""STIVE"" not common.

With K at position 2: ""SKI E"" like ""SKITE"" (not common), ""SKIVE"" (S K I V E), which is valid.

""SKIMO"" not.

With W at position 2: ""SWIPE"" (S W I P E), valid.

""SWIVE"" archaic.

With B: ""SBI E"" no words.

D: ""SDI E"" no.

F: ""SFI E"" no.

G: ""SGI E"" no.

J: ""SJI E"" no.

Q: ""SQI E"" no.

V: ""SVI E"" no.

X: ""SXI E"" no.

Y: ""SYLI E"" no, ""SYCE"" not 5 letters.

Z: ""SZI E"" no.

So the possible common words are:

- ""SPITE"" (P at 2, T at 4)
- ""SPIKE"" (P at 2, K at 4)
- ""STIPE"" (T at 2, P at 4)
- ""SKIVE"" (K at 2, V at 4)
- ""SWIPE"" (W at 2, P at 4)

And less common: ""SKITE"", etc.

Now, we have 5 possibilities, but we can eliminate with feedback.

In our guess, we can choose one that tests multiple.

For example, if I guess ""SPITE"", it covers P at position 2 and T at position 4.

If it's not correct, feedback will tell us about P and T.

Similarly.

Since S, I, E are fixed, and we have two positions, we might solve in one or two guesses.

But let's see the previous feedback doesn't have P or T, so we don't know.

I think ""SPITE"" is a good guess.

But in ""smile"", we had M and L excluded, but P and T are new.

Another word: ""SINCE"" but N excluded.

So I'll go with ""SPITE"".

But let's confirm the format.

Perhaps ""SWIPE"" to test W.

But ""SPITE"" is more common.

I think ""SPITE"" is fine.

So guess: SPITE

But in the response, we need to output.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have the following confirmed information:

- **Position 1**: S is correct (from ""smile"" feedback: S(✓)).
- **Position 3**: I is correct (from ""smile"" feedback: I(✓)).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (consistent across all guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N (from ""crane""), H, O, U (from ""house""), and M, L (from ""smile"") are not in the word.
- **Word pattern**: The secret word must be of the form S _ I _ E, where the second and fourth positions need to be filled with letters not excluded.

The available letters for positions 2 and 4 are: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since S, I, and E are already placed and not duplicated).

Possible words fitting S _ I _ E include:
- ""SPITE"" (P at position 2, T at position 4)
- ""SPIKE"" (P at position 2, K at position 4)
- ""STIPE"" (T at position 2, P at position 4)
- ""SKIVE"" (K at position 2, V at position 4)
- ""SWIPE"" (W at position 2, P at position 4)

""SPITE"" is a strong guess because:
- It tests two common consonants (P and T) that haven't been tried yet.
- It is a high-frequency English word, increasing the likelihood of a solution or informative feedback.
- If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether P or T is in the word and their positions, narrowing down the possibilities significantly.",Guess 4: spite -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
