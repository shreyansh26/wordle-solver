We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.
This helps cover frequent letters and positions.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. 
These are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.

So my first guess is: SLATE

I'll output it in the required format.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).
 - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is 'A'. We know 'A' is not in position 3.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.
 2. Contains the letter 'A' but not in the third position.
 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word must have an 'A'. So we can try a word that has 'A' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
 - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.
 - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let's check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put 'A' in the second position (which is different from the third).

 However, note that in the feedback, we only know that 'A' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let's check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. We'll assume no repeats for now.

 Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Let me list a few more:
 - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don't know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and 'A' in the second position.

 But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven't tried U. Actually, we haven't eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That's also a good candidate.

 However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven't tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.

 Let's choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 Since we don't know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven't tested and also test other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.

 However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don't have much information.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.

 Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven't eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has B, C, etc.

 After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.

 Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.

 Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:

 Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.

 Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. We'll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.

 Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.

 Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z's. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A's. We don't know if there are two A's, but it's possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.

 However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.

 Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": 
   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).

 But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.

 Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.

 So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that's good.
 For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that's also good.

 I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.

 ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.

 The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.

 But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.

 We don't know which one is better. So I'll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.

 However, there's another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don't know.

 After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.

 But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.

 Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.

 However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.

 Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.

 So I'll go with ""MANOR"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".

 We'll output: <guess>manor</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.
- Include A in a new position (not position 3).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""manor"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.
- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).

<guess>manor</guess>",manor,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":

 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.

 - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is 'A'. We know 'A' is not in position 3.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.
 2. Contains the letter 'A' but not in the third position.
 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word must have an 'A'. So we can try a word that has 'A' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
 - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.
 - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let's check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put 'A' in the second position (which is different from the third).

 However, note that in the feedback, we only know that 'A' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let's check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. We'll assume no repeats for now.

 Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Let me list a few more:
 - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don't know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and 'A' in the second position.

 But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven't tried U. Actually, we haven't eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That's also a good candidate.

 However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven't tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.

 Let's choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 Since we don't know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven't tested and also test other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.

 However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don't have much information.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.

 Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven't eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has B, C, etc.

 After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.

 Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.

 Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:

 Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.

 Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. We'll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.

 Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.

 Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z's. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A's. We don't know if there are two A's, but it's possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.

 However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.

 Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": 
   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).

 But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.

 Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.

 So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that's good.
 For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that's also good.

 I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.

 ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.

 The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.

 But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.

 We don't know which one is better. So I'll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.

 However, there's another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don't know.

 After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.

 But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.

 Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.

 However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.

 Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.

 So I'll go with ""MANOR"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".

 We'll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.
- Include A in a new position (not position 3).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""manor"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.
- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).

We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess feedback:
 From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.
 From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.

 Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

 And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.

 Now, we know the second letter is A. We need to find the other four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the second position.
 2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.
 3. Uses common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.

 Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 Available: A (but we already know it and it's fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can use these available letters.

 Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

 We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.

 We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We can try to form a word that includes several of these.

 Some words that come to mind:

 - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let's check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.

 - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B's. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D's. Again, repetition.

 - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z's and Z is uncommon.

 - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.

 - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.

 - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.

 - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.

 - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.

 - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.

 - ""DADDY"": two D's.

 Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G's.

 After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.

 However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.

 ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.

 ""HAPPY"": two P's.

 ""JAZZY"": two Z's.

 ""PADDY"": two D's.

 ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B's and two A's? We already know A is in the word, but we don't know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it's better to use distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).

 Let's compare the letters they cover:

 ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).
 ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.

 Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.

 Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D's, so we get less information.

 Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.

 ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.

 ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.

 ""FANCY"": N eliminated.

 ""HARDY"": R eliminated.

 ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.

 We must have A in the second position.

 So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]

 Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.

 ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A's.

 ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.

 ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.

 ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.

 ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.

 ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F's.

 ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.

 I'll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".

 We'll output: <guess>wacky</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2.
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).
- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: 
  - A is in position 2.
  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>wacky</guess>",wacky,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess feedback:
 From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.
 From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.

 Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

 And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.

 Now, we know the second letter is A. We need to find the other four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the second position.
 2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.
 3. Uses common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.

 Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 Available: A (but we already know it and it's fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can use these available letters.

 Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

 We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.

 We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We can try to form a word that includes several of these.

 Some words that come to mind:

 - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let's check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.

 - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B's. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D's. Again, repetition.

 - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z's and Z is uncommon.

 - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.

 - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.

 - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.

 - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.

 - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.

 - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.

 - ""DADDY"": two D's.

 Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G's.

 After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.

 However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.

 ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.

 ""HAPPY"": two P's.

 ""JAZZY"": two Z's.

 ""PADDY"": two D's.

 ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B's and two A's? We already know A is in the word, but we don't know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it's better to use distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).

 Let's compare the letters they cover:

 ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).
 ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.

 Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.

 Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D's, so we get less information.

 Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.

 ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.

 ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.

 ""FANCY"": N eliminated.

 ""HARDY"": R eliminated.

 ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.

 We must have A in the second position.

 So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]

 Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.

 ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A's.

 ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.

 ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.

 ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.

 ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.

 ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F's.

 ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.

 I'll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".

 We'll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,daddy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.
This helps cover frequent letters and positions.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. 
These are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.

So my first guess is: SLATE

I'll output it in the required format.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).
 - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is 'A'. We know 'A' is not in position 3.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.
 2. Contains the letter 'A' but not in the third position.
 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word must have an 'A'. So we can try a word that has 'A' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
 - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.
 - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let's check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put 'A' in the second position (which is different from the third).

 However, note that in the feedback, we only know that 'A' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let's check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. We'll assume no repeats for now.

 Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Let me list a few more:
 - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don't know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and 'A' in the second position.

 But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven't tried U. Actually, we haven't eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That's also a good candidate.

 However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven't tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.

 Let's choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 Since we don't know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven't tested and also test other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.

 However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don't have much information.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.

 Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven't eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has B, C, etc.

 After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.

 Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.

 Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:

 Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.

 Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. We'll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.

 Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.

 Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z's. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A's. We don't know if there are two A's, but it's possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.

 However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.

 Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": 
   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).

 But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.

 Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.

 So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that's good.
 For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that's also good.

 I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.

 ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.

 The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.

 But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.

 We don't know which one is better. So I'll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.

 However, there's another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don't know.

 After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.

 But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.

 Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.

 However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.

 Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.

 So I'll go with ""MANOR"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".

 We'll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.
- Include A in a new position (not position 3).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""manor"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.
- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).

Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.\nThis helps cover frequent letters and positions.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. \nThese are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.\n\nSo my first guess is: SLATE\n\nI\'ll output it in the required format.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":\n S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.\n L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.\n T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n So, we know:\n - The secret word contains the letter \'A\', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).\n - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is \'A\'. We know \'A\' is not in position 3.\n\n For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:\n 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.\n 2. Contains the letter \'A\' but not in the third position.\n 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We also know that the word must have an \'A\'. So we can try a word that has \'A\' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.\n\n Some candidate words that come to mind:\n - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.\n - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.\n - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let\'s check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put \'A\' in the second position (which is different from the third).\n\n However, note that in the feedback, we only know that \'A\' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let\'s check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it\'s less common. We\'ll assume no repeats for now.\n\n Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n However, we must ensure that the word is valid.\n\n Let me list a few more:\n - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don\'t know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and \'A\' in the second position.\n\n But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven\'t tried U. Actually, we haven\'t eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That\'s also a good candidate.\n\n However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\n Since we don\'t know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven\'t tested and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.\n\n However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don\'t have much information.\n\n Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.\n\n Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.\n\n Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven\'t eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it\'s okay.\n\n But we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has B, C, etc.\n\n After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.\n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.\n\n Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:\n\n Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.\n\n Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. We\'ll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.\n\n Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.\n\n Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z\'s. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A\'s. We don\'t know if there are two A\'s, but it\'s possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.\n\n However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.\n\n Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": \n   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).\n\n But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.\n\n Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.\n\n So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that\'s good.\n For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that\'s also good.\n\n I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\n ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.\n\n The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.\n\n But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.\n\n We don\'t know which one is better. So I\'ll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.\n\n However, there\'s another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don\'t know.\n\n After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.\n\n But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.\n\n Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.\n\n Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""MANOR"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":\n- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.\n- Include A in a new position (not position 3).\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""manor"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).\n- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).\n\n<guess>manor</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":\n M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.\n A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).\n N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.\n O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.\n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n\n Now, combining with the first guess feedback:\n From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.\n From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.\n\n Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.\n\n So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\n And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.\n\n Now, we know the second letter is A.

Uses common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n What letters are left? Let\'s list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.\n\n Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n Available: A (but we already know it and it\'s fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can use these available letters.\n\n Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.\n\n We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\n We can try to form a word that includes several of these.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n\n - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let\'s check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.\n\n - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B\'s. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.\n\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D\'s. Again, repetition.\n\n - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z\'s and Z is uncommon.\n\n - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.\n\n - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.\n\n - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.\n\n - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.\n\n - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.\n\n - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.\n\n - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.\n\n - ""DADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G\'s.\n\n After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.\n\n But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.\n\n However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.\n\n ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.\n\n ""HAPPY"": two P\'s.\n\n ""JAZZY"": two Z\'s.\n\n ""PADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B\'s and two A\'s? We already know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).\n\n Let\'s compare the letters they cover:\n\n ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).\n ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.\n\n Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.\n\n Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D\'s, so we get less information.\n\n Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.\n\n ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.\n\n ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.\n\n ""FANCY"": N eliminated.\n\n ""HARDY"": R eliminated.\n\n ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.\n\n We must have A in the second position.\n\n So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\n Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.\n\n ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A\'s.\n\n ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.\n\n ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.\n\n ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.\n\n ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.\n\n ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F\'s.\n\n ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.\n\n I\'ll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).\n- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).\n- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 2.\n- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).\n- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: \n  - A is in position 2.\n  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>wacky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\nGuess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess ""wacky"":
 W(x) -> W is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.
 Y(✓) -> Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 Combining all feedback so far:

 Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ Y
 Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y.

 Eliminated letters: 
 From guess1: S, L, T, E
 From guess2: M, N, O, R
 From guess3: W, C, K
 Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z

 Also, note that we know two letters: A (position 2) and Y (position 5). We need to find positions 1, 3, and 4.

 The word structure: [1] A [3] [4] Y

 We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
 - Does not contain any eliminated letters (so avoid S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K).
 - Uses letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

 Now, let's think of possible words.

 The word ends with Y, so the fourth letter is before Y. We need a word of the form ?A??Y.

 Some common words:
 - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 But let's check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.

 However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don't have information about the other positions.

 But ""HAPPY"" has two P's, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P's will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.

 However, let's list words without repeats first to test more letters.

 Candidates without repeated letters:

 - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.

 - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).

 - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let's check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.

 - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.

 - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.

 - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.

 Other possibilities: 
  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.
  ""DAUPH""? Not common.
  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.

 Let's try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.

 ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.

 ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.

 ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there's no such word? Not standard.

 ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don't think so.

 ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.

 Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D's.

 How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.

 ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.

 ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.

 ""WAVED"": W is eliminated? And E.

 ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""FUZED"": F, U, Z, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""GUIDY"": G, U, I, D, Y -> but position 4 is D and position 5 is Y. Is ""GUIDY"" a word? I think not.

 ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.

 After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).
   - The word is valid.

 But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:
   ""FADGY""? Not a word.
   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.

 Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.
   ""DAVY"": only four letters.

 We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.

 Therefore, we'll guess ""GAUDY"".

 One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated? From guess2: M(x) -> not in word. So M is eliminated.

 So ""GAUDY"" is our choice.

- Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z**.

 Also, note that we know two letters: A (position 2) and Y (position 5). We need to find positions 1, 3, and 4.

 The word structure: [1] A [3] [4] Y

 We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

 Now, let's think of possible words.

 The word ends with Y, so the fourth letter is before Y. We need a word of the form ?A??Y.

 Some common words:
 - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 But let's check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.

 However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don't have information about the other positions.

 But ""HAPPY"" has two P's, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P's will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.

 However, let's list words without repeats first to test more letters.

 Candidates without repeated letters:

 - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.

 - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).

 - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let's check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.

 - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.

 - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.

 - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.

 Other possibilities: 
  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.
  ""DAUPH""? Not common.
  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.

 Let's try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.

 ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.

 ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.

 ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there's no such word? Not standard.

 ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don't think so.

 ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.

 Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D's.

 How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.

 ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.

 ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.

 ""WAVED"": W is eliminated? And E.

 ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""FUZED"": F, U, Z, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""GUIDY"": G, U, I, D, Y -> but position 4 is D and position 5 is Y. Is ""GUIDY"" a word? I think not.

 ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.

 After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).
   - The word is valid.

 But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:
   ""FADGY""? Not a word.
   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.

 Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.
   ""DAVY"": only four letters.

 We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.

 Therefore, we'll guess ""GAUDY"".

 One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated? From guess2: M(x) -> not in word. So M is eliminated.

 So ""GAUDY"" is our choice.

<guess>gaudy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K**.
- Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z**.

For Guess 4:
- Must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- Should test new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., G, U, D).
- ""gaudy"" fits:
  - A in position 2, Y in position 5.
  - Tests new letters: G (position 1), U (position 3), D (position 4).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.",Guess 4: gaudy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,daddy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.
This helps cover frequent letters and positions.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. 
These are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.

So my first guess is: SLATE

I'll output it in the required format.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).
 - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is 'A'. We know 'A' is not in position 3.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.
 2. Contains the letter 'A' but not in the third position.
 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word must have an 'A'. So we can try a word that has 'A' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
 - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.
 - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let's check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put 'A' in the second position (which is different from the third).

 However, note that in the feedback, we only know that 'A' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let's check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. We'll assume no repeats for now.

 Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Let me list a few more:
 - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don't know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and 'A' in the second position.

 But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven't tried U. Actually, we haven't eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That's also a good candidate.

 However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven't tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.

 Let's choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 Since we don't know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven't tested and also test other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.

 However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don't have much information.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.

 Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven't eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has B, C, etc.

 After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.

 Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.

 Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:

 Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.

 Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. We'll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.

 Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.

 Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z's. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A's. We don't know if there are two A's, but it's possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.

 However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.

 Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": 
   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).

 But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.

 Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.

 So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that's good.
 For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that's also good.

 I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.

 ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.

 The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.

 But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.

 We don't know which one is better. So I'll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.

 However, there's another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don't know.

 After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.

 But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.

 Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.

 However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.

 Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.

 So I'll go with ""MANOR"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".

 We'll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.
- Include A in a new position (not position 3).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""manor"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.
- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).

<guess>manor</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess feedback:
 From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.
 From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.

 Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

 And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.

 Now, we know the second letter is A. We need to find the other four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the second position.
 2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.
 3. Uses common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.

 Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 Available: A (but we already know it and it's fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can use these available letters.

 Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

 We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.

 We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We can try to form a word that includes several of these.

 Some words that come to mind:

 - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let's check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.

 - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B's. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D's. Again, repetition.

 - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z's and Z is uncommon.

 - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.

 - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.

 - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.

 - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.

 - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.

 - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.

 - ""DADDY"": two D's.

 Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G's.

 After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.

 However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.

 ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.

 ""HAPPY"": two P's.

 ""JAZZY"": two Z's.

 ""PADDY"": two D's.

 ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B's and two A's? We already know A is in the word, but we don't know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it's better to use distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).

 Let's compare the letters they cover:

 ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).
 ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.

 Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.

 Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D's, so we get less information.

 Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.

 ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.

 ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.

 ""FANCY"": N eliminated.

 ""HARDY"": R eliminated.

 ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.

 We must have A in the second position.

 So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]

 Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.

 ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A's.

 ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.

 ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.

 ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.

 ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.

 ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F's.

 ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.

 I'll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".

 We'll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2.
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).
- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: 
  - A is in position 2.
  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>wacky</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)
Guess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""wacky"":
 W(x) -> W is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.
 Y(✓) -> Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 Combining all feedback so far:

 Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ Y
 Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y.

 Eliminated letters: 
 From guess1: S, L, T, E
 From guess2: M, N, O, R
 From guess3: W, C, K
 Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K

 Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z

 Also, note that we know two letters: A (position 2) and Y (position 5). We need to find positions 1, 3, and 4.

 The word structure: [1] A [3] [4] Y

 We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters from the available set, and the word must be valid.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Has A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
 - Does not contain any eliminated letters (so avoid S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K).
 - Uses letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

 Now, let's think of possible words.

 The word ends with Y, so the fourth letter is before Y. We need a word of the form ?A??Y.

 Some common words:
 - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 But let's check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.

 However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don't have information about the other positions.

 But ""HAPPY"" has two P's, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P's will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.

 However, let's list words without repeats first to test more letters.

 Candidates without repeated letters:

 - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.

 - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).

 - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let's check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.

 - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.

 - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.

 - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.

 Other possibilities: 
  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.
  ""DAUPH""? Not common.
  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.

 Let's try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.

 ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.

 ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.

 ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there's no such word? Not standard.

 ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don't think so.

 ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.

 Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D's.

 How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.

 ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.

 ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.

 ""WAVED"": W is eliminated? And E.

 ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""FUZED"": F, U, Z, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""GUIDY"": G, U, I, D, Y -> but position 4 is D and position 5 is Y. Is ""GUIDY"" a word? I think not.

 ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.

 After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).
   - The word is valid.

 But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:
   ""FADGY""? Not a word.
   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.

 Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.
   ""DAVY"": only four letters.

 We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.

 Therefore, we'll guess ""GAUDY"".

 One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated? From guess2: M(x) -> not in word. So M is eliminated.

 So ""GAUDY"" is our choice.

<guess>gaudy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K**.
- Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z**.

For Guess 4:
- Must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- Should test new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., G, U, D).
- ""gaudy"" fits:
  - A in position 2, Y in position 5.
  - Tests new letters: G (position 1), U (position 3), D (position 4).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.\nThis helps cover frequent letters and positions.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. \nThese are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.\n\nSo my first guess is: SLATE\n\nI\'ll output it in the required format.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":\n S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.\n L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.\n A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.\n T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.\n E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.\n\n So, we know:\n - The secret word contains the letter \'A\', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).\n - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.\n\n Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is \'A\'. We know \'A\' is not in position 3.\n\n For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:\n 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.\n 2. Contains the letter \'A\' but not in the third position.\n 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\n We also know that the word must have an \'A\'. So we can try a word that has \'A\' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.\n\n Some candidate words that come to mind:\n - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.\n - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.\n - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let\'s check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put \'A\' in the second position (which is different from the third).\n\n However, note that in the feedback, we only know that \'A\' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let\'s check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it\'s less common. We\'ll assume no repeats for now.\n\n Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.\n\n However, we must ensure that the word is valid.\n\n Let me list a few more:\n - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don\'t know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and \'A\' in the second position.\n\n But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven\'t tried U. Actually, we haven\'t eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That\'s also a good candidate.\n\n However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\n Since we don\'t know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven\'t tested and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.\n\n However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don\'t have much information.\n\n Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.\n\n Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.\n\n Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven\'t eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it\'s okay.\n\n But we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has B, C, etc.\n\n After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.\n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.\n\n Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:\n\n Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.\n\n Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. We\'ll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.\n\n Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.\n\n Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z\'s. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A\'s. We don\'t know if there are two A\'s, but it\'s possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.\n\n However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.\n\n Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": \n   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).\n\n But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.\n\n Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.\n\n So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that\'s good.\n For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that\'s also good.\n\n I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\n ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.\n\n The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.\n\n But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.\n\n We don\'t know which one is better. So I\'ll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.\n\n However, there\'s another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don\'t know.\n\n After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.\n\n But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.\n\n Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.\n\n Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""MANOR"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":\n- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.\n- Include A in a new position (not position 3).\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""manor"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).\n- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).\n\n<guess>manor</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":\n M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.\n A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).\n N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.\n O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.\n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n\n Now, combining with the first guess feedback:\n From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.\n From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.\n\n Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.\n\n So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\n And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.\n\n Now, we know the second letter is A.

Uses common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n What letters are left? Let\'s list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.\n\n Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n Available: A (but we already know it and it\'s fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can use these available letters.\n\n Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.\n\n We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\n We can try to form a word that includes several of these.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n\n - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let\'s check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.\n\n - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B\'s. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.\n\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D\'s. Again, repetition.\n\n - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z\'s and Z is uncommon.\n\n - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.\n\n - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.\n\n - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.\n\n - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.\n\n - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.\n\n - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.\n\n - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.\n\n - ""DADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G\'s.\n\n After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.\n\n But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.\n\n However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.\n\n ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.\n\n ""HAPPY"": two P\'s.\n\n ""JAZZY"": two Z\'s.\n\n ""PADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B\'s and two A\'s? We already know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).\n\n Let\'s compare the letters they cover:\n\n ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).\n ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.\n\n Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.\n\n Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D\'s, so we get less information.\n\n Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.\n\n ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.\n\n ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.\n\n ""FANCY"": N eliminated.\n\n ""HARDY"": R eliminated.\n\n ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.\n\n We must have A in the second position.\n\n So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\n Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.\n\n ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A\'s.\n\n ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.\n\n ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.\n\n ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.\n\n ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.\n\n ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F\'s.\n\n ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.\n\n I\'ll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).\n- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).\n- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 2.\n- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).\n- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: \n  - A is in position 2.\n  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>wacky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\nGuess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""wacky"":\n W(x) -> W is not in the secret word.\n A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.\n C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.\n K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.\n Y(✓) -> Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\n Combining all feedback so far:\n\n Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y.\n\n Eliminated letters: \n From guess1: S, L, T, E\n From guess2: M, N, O, R\n From guess3: W, C, K\n Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K\n\n Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z\n\n Also, note that we know two letters: A (position 2) and Y (position 5).

We need a word of the form ?A??Y.\n\n Some common words:\n - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.\n\n But let\'s check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.\n\n However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don\'t have information about the other positions.\n\n But ""HAPPY"" has two P\'s, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P\'s will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.\n\n However, let\'s list words without repeats first to test more letters.\n\n Candidates without repeated letters:\n\n - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.\n\n - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).\n\n - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let\'s check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.\n\n - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.\n\n - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.\n\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.\n\n - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.\n\n - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.\n\n - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.\n\n - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.\n\n - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.\n\n - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.\n\n After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.\n\n Other possibilities: \n  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.\n  ""DAUPH""? Not common.\n  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.\n\n Let\'s try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.\n\n ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.\n\n ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.\n\n ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there\'s no such word? Not standard.\n\n ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don\'t think so.\n\n ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.\n\n Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D\'s.\n\n How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.\n\n ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.\n\n ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.\n\n ""WAVED"": W is eliminated? And E.\n\n ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.\n\n ""FUZED"": F, U, Z, E, D -> E eliminated.\n\n ""GUIDY"": G, U, I, D, Y -> but position 4 is D and position 5 is Y. Is ""GUIDY"" a word? I think not.\n\n ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.\n\n After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).\n   - The word is valid.\n\n But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:\n   ""FADGY""? Not a word.\n   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.\n\n Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.\n   ""DAVY"": only four letters.\n\n We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.\n\n Therefore, we\'ll guess ""GAUDY"".\n\n One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated? From guess2: M(x) -> not in word. So M is eliminated.\n\n So ""GAUDY"" is our choice.\n\n<guess>gaudy</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).\n- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K**.\n- Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z**.\n\nFor Guess 4:\n- Must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.\n- Should test new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., G, U, D).\n- ""gaudy"" fits:\n  - A in position 2, Y in position 5.\n  - Tests new letters: G (position 1), U (position 3), D (position 4).\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>gaudy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\nGuess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: gaudy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""gaudy"":
 G(x) -> G is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.
 U(x) -> U is not in the secret word.
 D(✓) -> D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
 Y(✓) -> Y is in the correct position (position 5), which we already knew.

 So, combining all feedback:

 Secret word pattern: _ A _ D Y

 We know:
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 4: D
 - Position 5: Y

 We need to find positions 1 and 3.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: 
   From guess1: S, L, T, E
   From guess2: M, N, O, R
   From guess3: W, C, K
   From guess4: G, U

 Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U

 Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z

 And we know the word must be of the form: [1] A [3] D Y

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Has A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters (so avoid S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K,G,U).
   - The letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the available set: B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z.

 Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

 Let's try to think of words that end with ""DY"" and have ""A"" in the second position and ""D"" in the fourth.

 The pattern: ? A ? D Y

 We can list possible words:

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""FADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""HADAL"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""JADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> but this has two D's? The pattern requires position 4 to be D, so the word would be P A D D Y? But then position 3 is D? But we have position 3 as the third letter. So ""PADDY"" is P (1), A (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5). But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is D. So if we have D in position 3, that would be a different letter. However, the feedback for ""gaudy"" had D in position 4 (correct). So the secret word has D in position 4. But it might have D in other positions? We don't know. However, in ""PADDY"", there is a D in position 3 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two D's.

 But note: in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D(✓) for position 4. That only tells us that there is a D in position 4. It doesn't tell us about other D's. So it's possible that the word has another D.

 However, we must avoid eliminated letters. ""PADDY"" has P, A, D, D, Y. The letters are P, A, D, Y. A and D and Y are known to be in the word. P is available. But note: we have eliminated G and U, but P is not eliminated. So ""PADDY"" is a candidate.

 But let's check the pattern: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A (correct)
   Position 3: D -> but we don't know if D is in position 3? The feedback from ""gaudy"" only confirmed D in position 4. It didn't say anything about position 3. So if the secret word is ""PADDY"", then position 3 is D, which is a new position for D. But we haven't tested D in position 3 before? In ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4, so we know D is in the word and in position 4. But if the secret word has D in position 3 as well, then when we guessed ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 (correct) and we didn't have a D in position 3? Actually, in ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and no D in position 3? So if the secret word has D in position 3, then in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we would have seen a '-' for the D in position 3? But we didn't have a D in position 3 in ""gaudy"". We had U in position 3. So we don't have information about D in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PADDY"" is a possibility.

 But note: we are trying to find the word. We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3. And we know the word must have a D in position 4 and Y in 5, A in 2.

 Another candidate: ""HADED"": but E is eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIR"": N eliminated.

 ""RADII"": R eliminated.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""WADED"": W eliminated and E.

 ""BADDY"": B, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY but with B. Is ""BADDY"" a word? Not common, but ""baddy"" is an informal term for a villain. So it might be accepted.

 But we have to use valid words. Let's assume both ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are acceptable? But ""BADDY"" is sometimes spelled with a 'y'. However, we'll stick to common words.

 Another word: ""FADGY""? Not a word.

 ""HADJI"": H, A, D, J, I -> but then the word would be H A D J I? But we need the fourth letter to be D? In ""HADJI"", the letters are: H(1), A(2), D(3), J(4), I(5). But we need position 4 to be D, but in ""HADJI"" position 4 is J. So that doesn't match.

 We need position 4 to be D. So the word must have the fourth letter as D.

 How about ""HANDY"": but N is eliminated.

 ""PANDY"": P, A, N, D, Y -> but N is eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADES"": J, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""FADES"": F, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""HADES"": H, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""JAPED"": J, A, P, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""CAPED"": C and E eliminated.

 ""TAPED"": T and E eliminated.

 ""VAPID"": V, A, P, I, D -> but then the word is V A P I D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D -> but we need position 4 to be D? Here position 4 is I and position 5 is D. So it doesn't match.

 We need the fourth letter to be D and the fifth to be Y. So the word must end with ""DY"".

 Therefore, the only possibilities are words that have the pattern: [1] A [3] D Y

 And [1] and [3] must be from the available letters (B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z) and not eliminated.

 We already considered ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"". 

 What about ""FADDY""? F, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY. Is ""FADDY"" a word? It means someone who has fads? It's a word.

 Also, ""HADDY""? Not common.

 ""JADDY""? Not common.

 ""QADDI""? Not a word.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""ZADDY""? Slang, but might be accepted.

 But let's look for more common words.

 Another word: ""BADGE"" -> E eliminated.

 How about ""PAGED"": E eliminated.

 We are running out of options.

 But note: we have to consider that the letter in position 3 might be the same as D? But we already have D in position 4. So if we put D in position 3, then the word has two D's.

 The available letters for position 3: we can use D? But we haven't eliminated D? We know D is in the word (in position 4), but we can use it again? Yes, if the word has two D's.

 But in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have a D in position 3, so we don't know if there is a D in position 3. So it's possible.

 Therefore, the candidates are:
   ""BADDY"", ""FADDY"", ""PADDY"", etc.

 But we also have to consider that position 3 might be a different letter.

 For example, what if position 3 is not D? Then the word is [1] A [3] D Y, and [3] is not D. What words are there?

 For instance, ""HARDY"": but R is eliminated.

 ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""FARDY"": F, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""JARDY"": J, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""PARDY"": P, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""VARDY"": V, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""BANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""HANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""MANDY"": M and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""FADED"": E eliminated.

 ""HADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIA"": N and I? But the word must end with DY? ""NADIA"" ends with IA.

 So it seems that the only possibilities are words with two D's: one in position 4 and one in position 3? Or perhaps position 1?

 But the pattern is [1] A [3] D Y. So if we have a D in position 1, then the word is D A [3] D Y. Then position 1 is D and position 4 is D. That's two D's. But we haven't tried D in position 1. Is there a word ""DADDY""? Yes, ""DADDY"".

 And ""DADDY"" is a common word.

 So let's list the candidates with two D's:

   ""DADDY"": D(1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but wait, that's three D's? No: D (position1), A (2), D (3), D (4) -> that's three D's? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. But we have two D's in positions 3 and 4? That's two consecutive D's? Actually, it's D-A-D-D-Y, so the third and fourth letters are both D? That doesn't match the pattern because we have position 3 and 4: we need position 3 to be a letter and position 4 to be D. In ""DADDY"", position 3 is D and position 4 is D. So it fits the pattern: [1]=D, [2]=A, [3]=D, [4]=D, [5]=Y. But we have D in position 4? Yes. And we have D in position 3 as well.

 But note: we have eliminated many letters, but D is not eliminated. We know D is in the word (from guess4) and it's in position 4. So ""DADDY"" has D in positions 1, 3, and 4? That's three D's? Actually, no: the word ""daddy"" has three D's? Let me spell: D-A-D-D-Y -> that's D at position 1, 3, and 4? Yes, three D's. But that's possible? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has three D's. But we haven't ruled it out.

 But let's check the pattern: we need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be Y. ""DADDY"" satisfies that.

 But we also have ""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So two D's: positions 3 and 4.

 Similarly, ""BADDY"": B-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""FADDY"": F-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""DADDY"": D-A-D-D-Y.

 Now, which one to choose? We need to test position 1 and position 3.

 But note: in ""gaudy"", we had G in position 1 (which was wrong) and U in position 3 (wrong). So we don't have information about position 1 and 3.

 We have to guess one of these.

 But we can choose a word that tests new letters. For example, if we choose ""DADDY"", we are testing D in position 1 and 3. But we already know D is in the word (in position 4). So if we get feedback for ""DADDY"", we might get:

   Position1: D -> if it's present? But we don't know if there is a D in position 1. Similarly, position3: D -> we don't know.

 However, we are limited by the available words.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two D's? But we couldn't find any without two D's that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a word with two D's (or three) that fits the pattern.

 Let's list the candidates again:

   ""BADDY"": B in position1, D in position3, D in position4, Y in5.
   ""DADDY"": D in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""FADDY"": F in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""PADDY"": P in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.

 We also have ""HADDY""? Not common. ""JADDY""? Not common. ""VADDY""? Not common. ""ZADDY""? Slang.

 So among B, D, F, P for position1.

 We have to pick one. We can choose the most common word: ""DADDY"" or ""PADDY"".

 But note: we have not used B, F, P, etc. We want to maximize information? But we are at the fifth guess? We have two guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 5? The previous were 4 guesses? So we have two more guesses? But we want to solve it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a new letter in position1 and position3? But position3 is D in all these candidates. So we are only testing position1.

 So if we choose ""BADDY"", we test B in position1 and D in position3 (but we already know D is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that would be new information? But we know D is in position4, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that means there is another D? But we are putting D in position3 and position4. The feedback will tell us if position3 is correct or not.

 However, we are forced to have D in position3? Because we are using words that have D in position3? But is that necessary?

 Let me think again: is there a word that has position3 not D? We couldn't find one. So it seems that the only words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are the ones with D in position3 and position4.

 Therefore, we must choose one of these.

 I'll go with ""PADDY"" because it's a common word.

 But note: in ""PADDY"", we have P in position1 and D in position3 and4.

 We'll guess ""PADDY"".

<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U**.
- Available letters for positions 1 and 3: **B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z**.

Given the pattern and constraints:
- Position 3 must be filled, and the only feasible words found have D in position 3 (e.g., ""paddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"", ""daddy"") because no valid words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that avoid eliminated letters and fit the pattern.
- ""paddy"" is a common word that fits:
  - A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
  - Tests P (position 1) and D (position 3).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>paddy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U (not in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z.

After analyzing possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters, the only feasible candidates are words with **D in position 3** (since no valid English words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that meet the constraints). The remaining options are:
- `PADDY` (P in position 1, D in position 3)
- `BADDY` (B in position 1, D in position 3)
- `FADDY` (F in position 1, D in position 3)
- `DADDY` (D in position 1 and 3)

To maximize information and prioritize common words, **PADDY** is selected. It tests:
- P (new letter) in position 1.
- D (known letter) in position 3 (new position).

<guess>paddy</guess>",paddy,"We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""gaudy"":
 G(x) -> G is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.
 U(x) -> U is not in the secret word.
 D(✓) -> D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
 Y(✓) -> Y is in the correct position (position 5), which we already knew.

 So, combining all feedback:

 Secret word pattern: _ A _ D Y

 We know:
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 4: D
 - Position 5: Y

 We need to find positions 1 and 3.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: 
   From guess1: S, L, T, E
   From guess2: M, N, O, R
   From guess3: W, C, K
   From guess4: G, U

 Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U

 Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z

 And we know the word must be of the form: [1] A [3] D Y

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Has A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters (so avoid S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K,G,U).
   - The letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the available set: B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z.

 Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

 Let's try to think of words that end with ""DY"" and have ""A"" in the second position and ""D"" in the fourth.

 The pattern: ? A ? D Y

 We can list possible words:

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""FADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""HADAL"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""JADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> but this has two D's? The pattern requires position 4 to be D, so the word would be P A D D Y? But then position 3 is D? But we have position 3 as the third letter. So ""PADDY"" is P (1), A (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5). But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is D. So if we have D in position 3, that would be a different letter. However, the feedback for ""gaudy"" had D in position 4 (correct). So the secret word has D in position 4. But it might have D in other positions? We don't know. However, in ""PADDY"", there is a D in position 3 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two D's.

 But note: in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D(✓) for position 4. That only tells us that there is a D in position 4. It doesn't tell us about other D's. So it's possible that the word has another D.

 However, we must avoid eliminated letters. ""PADDY"" has P, A, D, D, Y. The letters are P, A, D, Y. A and D and Y are known to be in the word. P is available. But note: we have eliminated G and U, but P is not eliminated. So ""PADDY"" is a candidate.

 But let's check the pattern: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A (correct)
   Position 3: D -> but we don't know if D is in position 3? The feedback from ""gaudy"" only confirmed D in position 4. It didn't say anything about position 3. So if the secret word is ""PADDY"", then position 3 is D, which is a new position for D. But we haven't tested D in position 3 before? In ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4, so we know D is in the word and in position 4. But if the secret word has D in position 3 as well, then when we guessed ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 (correct) and we didn't have a D in position 3? Actually, in ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and no D in position 3? So if the secret word has D in position 3, then in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we would have seen a '-' for the D in position 3? But we didn't have a D in position 3 in ""gaudy"". We had U in position 3. So we don't have information about D in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PADDY"" is a possibility.

 But note: we are trying to find the word. We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3. And we know the word must have a D in position 4 and Y in 5, A in 2.

 Another candidate: ""HADED"": but E is eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIR"": N eliminated.

 ""RADII"": R eliminated.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""WADED"": W eliminated and E.

 ""BADDY"": B, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY but with B. Is ""BADDY"" a word? Not common, but ""baddy"" is an informal term for a villain. So it might be accepted.

 But we have to use valid words. Let's assume both ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are acceptable? But ""BADDY"" is sometimes spelled with a 'y'. However, we'll stick to common words.

 Another word: ""FADGY""? Not a word.

 ""HADJI"": H, A, D, J, I -> but then the word would be H A D J I? But we need the fourth letter to be D? In ""HADJI"", the letters are: H(1), A(2), D(3), J(4), I(5). But we need position 4 to be D, but in ""HADJI"" position 4 is J. So that doesn't match.

 We need position 4 to be D. So the word must have the fourth letter as D.

 How about ""HANDY"": but N is eliminated.

 ""PANDY"": P, A, N, D, Y -> but N is eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADES"": J, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""FADES"": F, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""HADES"": H, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""JAPED"": J, A, P, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""CAPED"": C and E eliminated.

 ""TAPED"": T and E eliminated.

 ""VAPID"": V, A, P, I, D -> but then the word is V A P I D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D -> but we need position 4 to be D? Here position 4 is I and position 5 is D. So it doesn't match.

 We need the fourth letter to be D and the fifth to be Y. So the word must end with ""DY"".

 Therefore, the only possibilities are words that have the pattern: [1] A [3] D Y

 And [1] and [3] must be from the available letters (B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z) and not eliminated.

 We already considered ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"". 

 What about ""FADDY""? F, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY. Is ""FADDY"" a word? It means someone who has fads? It's a word.

 Also, ""HADDY""? Not common.

 ""JADDY""? Not common.

 ""QADDI""? Not a word.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""ZADDY""? Slang, but might be accepted.

 But let's look for more common words.

 Another word: ""BADGE"" -> E eliminated.

 How about ""PAGED"": E eliminated.

 We are running out of options.

 But note: we have to consider that the letter in position 3 might be the same as D? But we already have D in position 4. So if we put D in position 3, then the word has two D's.

 The available letters for position 3: we can use D? But we haven't eliminated D? We know D is in the word (in position 4), but we can use it again? Yes, if the word has two D's.

 But in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have a D in position 3, so we don't know if there is a D in position 3. So it's possible.

 Therefore, the candidates are:
   ""BADDY"", ""FADDY"", ""PADDY"", etc.

 But we also have to consider that position 3 might be a different letter.

 For example, what if position 3 is not D? Then the word is [1] A [3] D Y, and [3] is not D. What words are there?

 For instance, ""HARDY"": but R is eliminated.

 ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""FARDY"": F, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""JARDY"": J, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""PARDY"": P, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""VARDY"": V, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""BANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""HANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""MANDY"": M and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""FADED"": E eliminated.

 ""HADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIA"": N and I? But the word must end with DY? ""NADIA"" ends with IA.

 So it seems that the only possibilities are words with two D's: one in position 4 and one in position 3? Or perhaps position 1?

 But the pattern is [1] A [3] D Y. So if we have a D in position 1, then the word is D A [3] D Y. Then position 1 is D and position 4 is D. That's two D's. But we haven't tried D in position 1. Is there a word ""DADDY""? Yes, ""DADDY"".

 And ""DADDY"" is a common word.

 So let's list the candidates with two D's:

   ""DADDY"": D(1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but wait, that's three D's? No: D (position1), A (2), D (3), D (4) -> that's three D's? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. But we have two D's in positions 3 and 4? That's two consecutive D's? Actually, it's D-A-D-D-Y, so the third and fourth letters are both D? That doesn't match the pattern because we have position 3 and 4: we need position 3 to be a letter and position 4 to be D. In ""DADDY"", position 3 is D and position 4 is D. So it fits the pattern: [1]=D, [2]=A, [3]=D, [4]=D, [5]=Y. But we have D in position 4? Yes. And we have D in position 3 as well.

 But note: we have eliminated many letters, but D is not eliminated. We know D is in the word (from guess4) and it's in position 4. So ""DADDY"" has D in positions 1, 3, and 4? That's three D's? Actually, no: the word ""daddy"" has three D's? Let me spell: D-A-D-D-Y -> that's D at position 1, 3, and 4? Yes, three D's. But that's possible? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has three D's. But we haven't ruled it out.

 But let's check the pattern: we need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be Y. ""DADDY"" satisfies that.

 But we also have ""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So two D's: positions 3 and 4.

 Similarly, ""BADDY"": B-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""FADDY"": F-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""DADDY"": D-A-D-D-Y.

 Now, which one to choose? We need to test position 1 and position 3.

 But note: in ""gaudy"", we had G in position 1 (which was wrong) and U in position 3 (wrong). So we don't have information about position 1 and 3.

 We have to guess one of these.

 But we can choose a word that tests new letters. For example, if we choose ""DADDY"", we are testing D in position 1 and 3. But we already know D is in the word (in position 4). So if we get feedback for ""DADDY"", we might get:

   Position1: D -> if it's present? But we don't know if there is a D in position 1. Similarly, position3: D -> we don't know.

 However, we are limited by the available words.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two D's? But we couldn't find any without two D's that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a word with two D's (or three) that fits the pattern.

 Let's list the candidates again:

   ""BADDY"": B in position1, D in position3, D in position4, Y in5.
   ""DADDY"": D in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""FADDY"": F in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""PADDY"": P in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.

 We also have ""HADDY""? Not common. ""JADDY""? Not common. ""VADDY""? Not common. ""ZADDY""? Slang.

 So among B, D, F, P for position1.

 We have to pick one. We can choose the most common word: ""DADDY"" or ""PADDY"".

 But note: we have not used B, F, P, etc. We want to maximize information? But we are at the fifth guess? We have two guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 5? The previous were 4 guesses? So we have two more guesses? But we want to solve it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a new letter in position1 and position3? But position3 is D in all these candidates. So we are only testing position1.

 So if we choose ""BADDY"", we test B in position1 and D in position3 (but we already know D is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that would be new information? But we know D is in position4, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that means there is another D? But we are putting D in position3 and position4. The feedback will tell us if position3 is correct or not.

 However, we are forced to have D in position3? Because we are using words that have D in position3? But is that necessary?

 Let me think again: is there a word that has position3 not D? We couldn't find one. So it seems that the only words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are the ones with D in position3 and position4.

 Therefore, we must choose one of these.

 I'll go with ""PADDY"" because it's a common word.

 But note: in ""PADDY"", we have P in position1 and D in position3 and4.

 We'll guess ""PADDY"".

<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U**.
- Available letters for positions 1 and 3: **B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z**.

Given the pattern and constraints:
- Position 3 must be filled, and the only feasible words found have D in position 3 (e.g., ""paddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"", ""daddy"") because no valid words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that avoid eliminated letters and fit the pattern.
- ""paddy"" is a common word that fits:
  - A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
  - Tests P (position 1) and D (position 3).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U (not in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z.

After analyzing possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters, the only feasible candidates are words with **D in position 3** (since no valid English words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that meet the constraints). The remaining options are:
- `PADDY` (P in position 1, D in position 3)
- `BADDY` (B in position 1, D in position 3)
- `FADDY` (F in position 1, D in position 3)
- `DADDY` (D in position 1 and 3)

To maximize information and prioritize common words, **PADDY** is selected. It tests:
- P (new letter) in position 1.
- D (known letter) in position 3 (new position).",Guess 5: paddy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,daddy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""TRACE"", etc.
This helps cover frequent letters and positions.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E. 
These are frequent and can give good feedback about the presence and positions of letters.

So my first guess is: SLATE

I'll output it in the required format.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
 S(x) -> S is not in the secret word.
 L(x) -> L is not in the secret word.
 A(-) -> A is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
 T(x) -> T is not in the secret word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the secret word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the position we guessed (which was the third position).
 - The letters S, L, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since we have eliminated S, L, T, E, we should avoid using these letters in our next guess.

 Also, note that the secret word has 5 letters and one of them is 'A'. We know 'A' is not in position 3.

 For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain S, L, T, E.
 2. Contains the letter 'A' but not in the third position.
 3. Includes other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We also know that the word must have an 'A'. So we can try a word that has 'A' in a different position (like first, second, fourth, or fifth) and includes other new common letters.

 Some candidate words that come to mind:
 - ""CRANE"" -> but E is eliminated, so no.
 - ""PAINT"" -> T is eliminated, so no.
 - ""DRAIN"" -> no eliminated letters? Let's check: D, R, A, I, N. None of these are in the eliminated set (S,L,T,E). Also, we can put 'A' in the second position (which is different from the third).

 However, note that in the feedback, we only know that 'A' is present but not in position 3. It could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another candidate: ""RADIO"" -> contains A and avoids S,L,T,E. But let's check the letters: R, A, D, I, O. All are new.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. We might also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but it's less common. We'll assume no repeats for now.

 Another good candidate: ""ORGAN"" -> O, R, G, A, N. Again, avoids the eliminated letters.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Let me list a few more:
 - ""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O -> avoids S,L,T,E. But we don't know if M, N, G, O are in the word. This is a good candidate because it has common letters and 'A' in the second position.

 But note: we have to consider that we have only one known letter (A) and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" -> but we have eliminated U? No, we haven't tried U. Actually, we haven't eliminated U. But wait, the feedback only eliminated S,L,T,E. So U is allowed. However, ""AUDIO"" has A in the first position and U, D, I, O. That's also a good candidate.

 However, we must avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. ""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven't tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.

 Let's choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 Since we don't know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven't tested and also test other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.

 However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don't have much information.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.

 Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven't eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it's okay.

 But we have to be cautious: we don't know if the word has B, C, etc.

 After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.

 Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.

 However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.

 But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.

 Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:

 Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.

 Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. We'll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.

 Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.

 Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z's. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A's. We don't know if there are two A's, but it's possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.

 However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.

 Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": 
   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).

 But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.

 Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.

 Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.

 So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that's good.
 For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that's also good.

 I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.

 ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.
 ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.

 The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.

 But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.

 We don't know which one is better. So I'll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.

 However, there's another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don't know.

 After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.

 But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.

 Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.

 However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.

 Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.

 So I'll go with ""MANOR"".

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".

 We'll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":
- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.
- Include A in a new position (not position 3).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

The word ""manor"" fits these criteria:
- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).
- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.
- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).

<guess>manor</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":
 M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.

 Now, combining with the first guess feedback:
 From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.
 From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.

 Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _

 And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.

 Now, we know the second letter is A. We need to find the other four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Has A in the second position.
 2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.
 3. Uses common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.

 Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.

 Available: A (but we already know it and it's fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can use these available letters.

 Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

 We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.

 We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

 We can try to form a word that includes several of these.

 Some words that come to mind:

 - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let's check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.

 - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B's. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D's. Again, repetition.

 - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z's and Z is uncommon.

 - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.

 - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.

 - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.

 - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.

 - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.

 - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.

 - ""DADDY"": two D's.

 Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G's.

 After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.

 But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.

 However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.

 ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.

 ""HAPPY"": two P's.

 ""JAZZY"": two Z's.

 ""PADDY"": two D's.

 ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B's and two A's? We already know A is in the word, but we don't know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it's better to use distinct letters.

 Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).

 Let's compare the letters they cover:

 ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).
 ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.

 Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.

 Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D's, so we get less information.

 Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.

 ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.

 ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.

 ""FANCY"": N eliminated.

 ""HARDY"": R eliminated.

 ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.

 We must have A in the second position.

 So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]

 Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.

 ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A's.

 ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.

 ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.

 ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.

 ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.

 ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F's.

 ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P's.

 So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.

 I'll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it's valid.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".

 We'll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2.
- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).
- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: 
  - A is in position 2.
  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

 - Uses letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,P,Q,U,V,X,Z.

 Now, let's think of possible words.

 The word ends with Y, so the fourth letter is before Y. We need a word of the form ?A??Y.

 Some common words:
 - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 But let's check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.

 However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don't know.

 But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don't have information about the other positions.

 But ""HAPPY"" has two P's, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P's will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.

 However, let's list words without repeats first to test more letters.

 Candidates without repeated letters:

 - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.

 - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).

 - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let's check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.

 - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.

 - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.

 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.

 - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.

 - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.

 - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.

 - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.

 After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.

 Other possibilities: 
  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.
  ""DAUPH""? Not common.
  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.

 Let's try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.

 How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.

 ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.

 ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.

 ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there's no such word? Not standard.

 ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don't think so.

 ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.

 Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D's.

 How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.

 ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.

 ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.

 ""WAVED"": W is eliminated? And E.

 ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""FUZED"": F, U, Z, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""GUIDY"": G, U, I, D, Y -> but position 4 is D and position 5 is Y. Is ""GUIDY"" a word? I think not.

 ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.

 After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).
   - The word is valid.

 But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:
   ""FADGY""? Not a word.
   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.

 Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.
   ""DAVY"": only four letters.

 We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.

 Therefore, we'll guess ""GAUDY"".

 One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated? From guess2: M(x) -> not in word. So M is eliminated.

 So ""GAUDY"" is our choice.

<guess>gaudy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ _ Y` (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K**.
- Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z**.

For Guess 4:
- Must have A in position 2 and Y in position 5.
- Should test new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., G, U, D).
- ""gaudy"" fits:
  - A in position 2, Y in position 5.
  - Tests new letters: G (position 1), U (position 3), D (position 4).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>gaudy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)
Guess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: gaudy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""gaudy"":
 G(x) -> G is not in the secret word.
 A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.
 U(x) -> U is not in the secret word.
 D(✓) -> D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
 Y(✓) -> Y is in the correct position (position 5), which we already knew.

 So, combining all feedback:

 Secret word pattern: _ A _ D Y

 We know:
 - Position 2: A
 - Position 4: D
 - Position 5: Y

 We need to find positions 1 and 3.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: 
   From guess1: S, L, T, E
   From guess2: M, N, O, R
   From guess3: W, C, K
   From guess4: G, U

 Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U

 Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z

 And we know the word must be of the form: [1] A [3] D Y

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Has A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters (so avoid S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K,G,U).
   - The letters in positions 1 and 3 must be from the available set: B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z.

 Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern.

 Let's try to think of words that end with ""DY"" and have ""A"" in the second position and ""D"" in the fourth.

 The pattern: ? A ? D Y

 We can list possible words:

 - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""FADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""HADAL"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""JADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.
 - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> but this has two D's? The pattern requires position 4 to be D, so the word would be P A D D Y? But then position 3 is D? But we have position 3 as the third letter. So ""PADDY"" is P (1), A (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5). But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is D. So if we have D in position 3, that would be a different letter. However, the feedback for ""gaudy"" had D in position 4 (correct). So the secret word has D in position 4. But it might have D in other positions? We don't know. However, in ""PADDY"", there is a D in position 3 and 4. But we don't know if the secret word has two D's.

 But note: in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D(✓) for position 4. That only tells us that there is a D in position 4. It doesn't tell us about other D's. So it's possible that the word has another D.

 However, we must avoid eliminated letters. ""PADDY"" has P, A, D, D, Y. The letters are P, A, D, Y. A and D and Y are known to be in the word. P is available. But note: we have eliminated G and U, but P is not eliminated. So ""PADDY"" is a candidate.

 But let's check the pattern: 
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: A (correct)
   Position 3: D -> but we don't know if D is in position 3? The feedback from ""gaudy"" only confirmed D in position 4. It didn't say anything about position 3. So if the secret word is ""PADDY"", then position 3 is D, which is a new position for D. But we haven't tested D in position 3 before? In ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4, so we know D is in the word and in position 4. But if the secret word has D in position 3 as well, then when we guessed ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 (correct) and we didn't have a D in position 3? Actually, in ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and no D in position 3? So if the secret word has D in position 3, then in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we would have seen a '-' for the D in position 3? But we didn't have a D in position 3 in ""gaudy"". We had U in position 3. So we don't have information about D in position 3.

 Therefore, ""PADDY"" is a possibility.

 But note: we are trying to find the word. We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3. And we know the word must have a D in position 4 and Y in 5, A in 2.

 Another candidate: ""HADED"": but E is eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIR"": N eliminated.

 ""RADII"": R eliminated.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""WADED"": W eliminated and E.

 ""BADDY"": B, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY but with B. Is ""BADDY"" a word? Not common, but ""baddy"" is an informal term for a villain. So it might be accepted.

 But we have to use valid words. Let's assume both ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are acceptable? But ""BADDY"" is sometimes spelled with a 'y'. However, we'll stick to common words.

 Another word: ""FADGY""? Not a word.

 ""HADJI"": H, A, D, J, I -> but then the word would be H A D J I? But we need the fourth letter to be D? In ""HADJI"", the letters are: H(1), A(2), D(3), J(4), I(5). But we need position 4 to be D, but in ""HADJI"" position 4 is J. So that doesn't match.

 We need position 4 to be D. So the word must have the fourth letter as D.

 How about ""HANDY"": but N is eliminated.

 ""PANDY"": P, A, N, D, Y -> but N is eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADES"": J, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""FADES"": F, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""HADES"": H, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.

 ""JAPED"": J, A, P, E, D -> E eliminated.

 ""CAPED"": C and E eliminated.

 ""TAPED"": T and E eliminated.

 ""VAPID"": V, A, P, I, D -> but then the word is V A P I D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D -> but we need position 4 to be D? Here position 4 is I and position 5 is D. So it doesn't match.

 We need the fourth letter to be D and the fifth to be Y. So the word must end with ""DY"".

 Therefore, the only possibilities are words that have the pattern: [1] A [3] D Y

 And [1] and [3] must be from the available letters (B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z) and not eliminated.

 We already considered ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"". 

 What about ""FADDY""? F, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY. Is ""FADDY"" a word? It means someone who has fads? It's a word.

 Also, ""HADDY""? Not common.

 ""JADDY""? Not common.

 ""QADDI""? Not a word.

 ""VADED"": E eliminated.

 ""ZADDY""? Slang, but might be accepted.

 But let's look for more common words.

 Another word: ""BADGE"" -> E eliminated.

 How about ""PAGED"": E eliminated.

 We are running out of options.

 But note: we have to consider that the letter in position 3 might be the same as D? But we already have D in position 4. So if we put D in position 3, then the word has two D's.

 The available letters for position 3: we can use D? But we haven't eliminated D? We know D is in the word (in position 4), but we can use it again? Yes, if the word has two D's.

 But in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and it was correct. We didn't have a D in position 3, so we don't know if there is a D in position 3. So it's possible.

 Therefore, the candidates are:
   ""BADDY"", ""FADDY"", ""PADDY"", etc.

 But we also have to consider that position 3 might be a different letter.

 For example, what if position 3 is not D? Then the word is [1] A [3] D Y, and [3] is not D. What words are there?

 For instance, ""HARDY"": but R is eliminated.

 ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""FARDY"": F, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""JARDY"": J, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""PARDY"": P, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""VARDY"": V, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.

 ""BANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.

 ""HANDY"": N eliminated.

 ""MANDY"": M and N eliminated.

 ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.

 ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.

 ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.

 ""JADED"": E eliminated.

 ""FADED"": E eliminated.

 ""HADED"": E eliminated.

 ""NADIA"": N and I? But the word must end with DY? ""NADIA"" ends with IA.

 So it seems that the only possibilities are words with two D's: one in position 4 and one in position 3? Or perhaps position 1?

 But the pattern is [1] A [3] D Y. So if we have a D in position 1, then the word is D A [3] D Y. Then position 1 is D and position 4 is D. That's two D's. But we haven't tried D in position 1. Is there a word ""DADDY""? Yes, ""DADDY"".

 And ""DADDY"" is a common word.

 So let's list the candidates with two D's:

   ""DADDY"": D(1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but wait, that's three D's? No: D (position1), A (2), D (3), D (4) -> that's three D's? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. But we have two D's in positions 3 and 4? That's two consecutive D's? Actually, it's D-A-D-D-Y, so the third and fourth letters are both D? That doesn't match the pattern because we have position 3 and 4: we need position 3 to be a letter and position 4 to be D. In ""DADDY"", position 3 is D and position 4 is D. So it fits the pattern: [1]=D, [2]=A, [3]=D, [4]=D, [5]=Y. But we have D in position 4? Yes. And we have D in position 3 as well.

 But note: we have eliminated many letters, but D is not eliminated. We know D is in the word (from guess4) and it's in position 4. So ""DADDY"" has D in positions 1, 3, and 4? That's three D's? Actually, no: the word ""daddy"" has three D's? Let me spell: D-A-D-D-Y -> that's D at position 1, 3, and 4? Yes, three D's. But that's possible? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

 However, we don't know if the secret word has three D's. But we haven't ruled it out.

 But let's check the pattern: we need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be Y. ""DADDY"" satisfies that.

 But we also have ""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So two D's: positions 3 and 4.

 Similarly, ""BADDY"": B-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""FADDY"": F-A-D-D-Y.

 And ""DADDY"": D-A-D-D-Y.

 Now, which one to choose? We need to test position 1 and position 3.

 But note: in ""gaudy"", we had G in position 1 (which was wrong) and U in position 3 (wrong). So we don't have information about position 1 and 3.

 We have to guess one of these.

 But we can choose a word that tests new letters. For example, if we choose ""DADDY"", we are testing D in position 1 and 3. But we already know D is in the word (in position 4). So if we get feedback for ""DADDY"", we might get:

   Position1: D -> if it's present? But we don't know if there is a D in position 1. Similarly, position3: D -> we don't know.

 However, we are limited by the available words.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have two D's? But we couldn't find any without two D's that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a word with two D's (or three) that fits the pattern.

 Let's list the candidates again:

   ""BADDY"": B in position1, D in position3, D in position4, Y in5.
   ""DADDY"": D in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""FADDY"": F in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.
   ""PADDY"": P in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.

 We also have ""HADDY""? Not common. ""JADDY""? Not common. ""VADDY""? Not common. ""ZADDY""? Slang.

 So among B, D, F, P for position1.

 We have to pick one. We can choose the most common word: ""DADDY"" or ""PADDY"".

 But note: we have not used B, F, P, etc. We want to maximize information? But we are at the fifth guess? We have two guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 5? The previous were 4 guesses? So we have two more guesses? But we want to solve it.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a new letter in position1 and position3? But position3 is D in all these candidates. So we are only testing position1.

 So if we choose ""BADDY"", we test B in position1 and D in position3 (but we already know D is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that would be new information? But we know D is in position4, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that means there is another D? But we are putting D in position3 and position4. The feedback will tell us if position3 is correct or not.

 However, we are forced to have D in position3? Because we are using words that have D in position3? But is that necessary?

 Let me think again: is there a word that has position3 not D? We couldn't find one. So it seems that the only words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are the ones with D in position3 and position4.

 Therefore, we must choose one of these.

 I'll go with ""PADDY"" because it's a common word.

 But note: in ""PADDY"", we have P in position1 and D in position3 and4.

 We'll guess ""PADDY"".

<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback:
- The secret word is `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U**.
- Available letters for positions 1 and 3: **B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z**.

Given the pattern and constraints:
- Position 3 must be filled, and the only feasible words found have D in position 3 (e.g., ""paddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"", ""daddy"") because no valid words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that avoid eliminated letters and fit the pattern.
- ""paddy"" is a common word that fits:
  - A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.
  - Tests P (position 1) and D (position 3).
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U (not in the word).
- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z.

After analyzing possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters, the only feasible candidates are words with **D in position 3** (since no valid English words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that meet the constraints). The remaining options are:
- `PADDY` (P in position 1, D in position 3)
- `BADDY` (B in position 1, D in position 3)
- `FADDY` (F in position 1, D in position 3)
- `DADDY` (D in position 1 and 3)

To maximize information and prioritize common words, **PADDY** is selected. It tests:
- P (new letter) in position 1.
- D (known letter) in position 3 (new position).

""AUDIO"" does not contain any of these.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter A in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried A in position 3 and it was wrong. So in the next guess, we can try A in a different position.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has A in the first position? Or second? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\n Since we don\'t know, we can try to put A in a position that we haven\'t tested and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and one consonant (D) and covers A, U, D, I, O. But note: the secret word might not have that many vowels. Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar.\n\n However, we have to remember that we have only 5 positions and we already know A is in the word. So testing more consonants might be better? But we don\'t have much information.\n\n Another idea: since we know A is in the word, we can try to use it in a different position and also test other common consonants.\n\n Let me think of words that have A in the second position? For example, ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. This avoids S,L,T,E.\n\n Or ""BACON"" -> but B, A, C, O, N. But we haven\'t eliminated B, C, O, N. However, note that we have to avoid the eliminated letters: S,L,T,E. So ""BACON"" is acceptable? But wait, we have to check: B, A, C, O, N. None of these are S,L,T,E. So it\'s okay.\n\n But we have to be cautious: we don\'t know if the word has B, C, etc.\n\n After considering, I think a good word is ""RAINY"" -> but Y is less common. Or ""DAIRY"" -> D, A, I, R, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""CARGO"" -> but C, A, R, G, O. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that in the first guess we had A in the third position and it was wrong. Now, if we put A in the second position (like in ""CARGO""), that would be a new position.\n\n But note: we are not forced to put A in the second position. We could put it in the first, fourth, or fifth.\n\n Let me list a few words without the eliminated letters and with A in a new position:\n\n Position 1: AUDIO, ADIEU (but E is eliminated -> so ADIEU is invalid because of E), ADOBE (E eliminated), so not many. How about ""ANGRY""? -> A, N, G, R, Y. That works.\n\n Position 2: MANOR, BACON, FAUNA (but U and N are new, and we have two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. We\'ll avoid duplicates for now to maximize information. So ""MANOR"" is good.\n\n Position 4: We can try a word like ""PLAIN"" -> but P, L, A, I, N -> but L is eliminated! So we cannot use L. Similarly, ""TRAIN"" -> T is eliminated. So position 4 is tricky.\n\n Position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z which is uncommon and two Z\'s. Not ideal. ""AROMA"" -> A, R, O, M, A -> has two A\'s. We don\'t know if there are two A\'s, but it\'s possible. But we are testing A again? We already know A is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we do need to find its position. But we can test it in multiple positions over different guesses.\n\n However, for the second guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible and also the position of A.\n\n Considering all, I think a balanced word is ""MANOR"": \n   M (new), A (in position 2, which is new), N (new), O (new), R (new).\n\n But note: we are not required to put A in the second position. We could also consider ""AUDIO"" which has A in the first position and tests U, D, I, O.\n\n Both are good. However, ""AUDIO"" uses four vowels and one consonant, which might not be optimal because the secret word might have more consonants. Also, we already know one vowel (A) is present.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""CRAMP"" -> but C, R, A, M, P. This avoids S,L,T,E. And A is in the third position? But wait, we already tried A in the third position and it was wrong. So we must not put A in the third position again. So ""CRAMP"" would put A in the third position again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting A in the third position.\n\n So for ""MANOR"": A is in the second position -> that\'s good.\n For ""AUDIO"": A is in the first position -> that\'s also good.\n\n I think both are valid. Let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\n ""MANOR"": M, A, N, O, R -> common letters: A, R, O, N, M.\n ""AUDIO"": A, U, D, I, O -> common letters: A, O, I, U, D.\n\n The letters in ""MANOR"" are more common in 5-letter words? R, N, O are very common.\n\n But note: we are also trying to find the position of A. In ""MANOR"", we are testing A in position 2. In ""AUDIO"", we are testing A in position 1.\n\n We don\'t know which one is better. So I\'ll choose ""MANOR"" because it has more common consonants.\n\n However, there\'s another candidate: ""ADORN"" -> A in first position, then D, O, R, N. This also avoids the eliminated letters and tests A in a new position (first) and also tests D, O, R, N.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have A in the first position? We don\'t know.\n\n After careful thought, I think ""MANOR"" is a solid choice.\n\n But wait, what about ""BRAND""? -> B, R, A, N, D. But A is in the third position again? We must avoid that. So no.\n\n Another one: ""FANCY"" -> F, A, N, C, Y. A is in the second position. This is acceptable.\n\n However, I think ""MANOR"" is a good word.\n\n Let me check if ""MANOR"" is a valid word: yes, it means a large house or building.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""MANOR"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. We have eliminated S, L, T, E. ""MANOR"" has M, A, N, O, R -> none of these are eliminated. So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""MANOR"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>manor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"":\n- S, L, T, and E are **not** in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- A is in the secret word but **not in position 3** (indicated by ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid using S, L, T, or E.\n- Include A in a new position (not position 3).\n- Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""manor"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains A in position 2 (a new position).\n- Uses new common letters: M, N, O, R.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (S, L, T, E).\n\n<guess>manor</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""manor"":\n M(x) -> M is not in the secret word.\n A(✓) -> A is in the secret word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).\n N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.\n O(x) -> O is not in the secret word.\n R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.\n\n Now, combining with the first guess feedback:\n From guess 1: S, L, T, E are not in the word.\n From guess 2: M, N, O, R are not in the word.\n\n Also, we know that A is in the word and it is in the second position.\n\n So, the secret word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\n And the eliminated letters are: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n We have to avoid using these eliminated letters.\n\n Now, we know the second letter is A. We need to find the other four letters.\n\n We should choose a word that:\n 1. Has A in the second position.\n 2. Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n 3. Uses common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n What letters are left? Let\'s list the alphabet and remove the eliminated ones.\n\n Eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R.\n\n Available: A (but we already know it and it\'s fixed in position 2), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can use these available letters.\n\n Since we have A fixed in the second position, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters from the available set.\n\n We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters from the available set: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y.\n\n We can try to form a word that includes several of these.\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n\n - ""BAWDY"": B, A, W, D, Y -> but let\'s check: positions: B (1), A (2), W (3), D (4), Y (5). And the letters are available? B, W, D, Y are available. So yes.\n\n - ""CABBY"": but B is repeated and we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? But the word has two B\'s. Also, we are trying to get information, so repeating a letter might not be efficient. Moreover, we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. But to maximize information, we should avoid repeats in our guess if possible.\n\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> has two D\'s. Again, repetition.\n\n - ""HAPPY"": H, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> two Z\'s and Z is uncommon.\n\n - ""FAVOR"": but O and R are eliminated.\n\n - ""DAILY"": but L is eliminated.\n\n - ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> all available. Pattern: G(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5). This seems good.\n\n - ""PACKY"": P, A, C, K, Y -> but C and K are available. However, ""PACKY"" might not be a common word? Let me think: ""packy"" is not standard; we should use common words.\n\n - ""PACKS"": but S is eliminated.\n\n - ""BACKS"": S eliminated.\n\n - ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> this is a common word. Pattern: W(1), A(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). And letters are available.\n\n - ""DADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n Another one: ""BAGGY"": two G\'s.\n\n After considering, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" are good candidates.\n\n But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""GAWKY"" means nervously awkward, and ""WACKY"" means funny or amusing in a slightly odd way. Both are valid.\n\n However, we can also consider ""CABIN"": but N is eliminated.\n\n ""DAISY"": S is eliminated.\n\n ""HAPPY"": two P\'s.\n\n ""JAZZY"": two Z\'s.\n\n ""PADDY"": two D\'s.\n\n ""BABKA"": B, A, B, K, A -> two B\'s and two A\'s? We already know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if there is a second A. But we are trying to avoid repeats for maximum information. So it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\n Therefore, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" both have distinct letters (except that they are different words).\n\n Let\'s compare the letters they cover:\n\n ""GAWKY"": G, A, W, K, Y -> tests G, W, K, Y (and A which we already know).\n ""WACKY"": W, A, C, K, Y -> tests W, C, K, Y.\n\n Both test K and Y. The difference is G vs C.\n\n Which is more common? In English, C is more common than G? Actually, both are common. But we can choose either.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""PADDY"" but it has two D\'s, so we get less information.\n\n Another word: ""BALDY"" -> but L is eliminated.\n\n ""CAMPY"": M is eliminated.\n\n ""DANCE"": N and E eliminated.\n\n ""FANCY"": N eliminated.\n\n ""HARDY"": R eliminated.\n\n ""JUDGY"": D, G, Y -> but J, U, D, G, Y. All available? J, U, D, G, Y are available. Pattern: J(1), U(2)? No, we need A in the second position. So we cannot use ""JUDGY"" because the second letter must be A.\n\n We must have A in the second position.\n\n So the word must be: [letter] A [letter] [letter] [letter]\n\n Another candidate: ""BAYOU"": B, A, Y, O, U -> but O is eliminated.\n\n ""FAUNA"": F, A, U, N, A -> but N is eliminated and also two A\'s.\n\n ""HAVOC"": H, A, V, O, C -> O eliminated.\n\n ""KAPUT"": K, A, P, U, T -> T eliminated.\n\n ""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> L and T eliminated.\n\n ""WAIVE"": W, A, I, V, E -> E eliminated.\n\n ""YAFFS"": Y, A, F, F, S -> S eliminated and two F\'s.\n\n ""ZAPPY"": Z, A, P, P, Y -> two P\'s.\n\n So, after this, ""GAWKY"" and ""WACKY"" seem among the best.\n\n I\'ll choose ""WACKY"" because it has C which is a very common letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ""WACKY"" uses W, A, C, K, Y. None of these are eliminated (eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R). So it\'s valid.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""WACKY"".\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>wacky</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""slate""): S, L, T, E are **not** in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""manor""): M, N, O, R are **not** in the secret word, and A is **correctly placed in position 2**.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).\n- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R** (avoid these).\n- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 2.\n- Should prioritize testing new, common letters from the remaining set (e.g., C, K, W, Y).\n- ""wacky"" fits perfectly: \n  - A is in position 2.\n  - Tests new common letters: W, C, K, Y.\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>wacky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\nGuess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""wacky"":\n W(x) -> W is not in the secret word.\n A(✓) -> A is in the correct position (position 2), which we already knew.\n C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.\n K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.\n Y(✓) -> Y is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\n Combining all feedback so far:\n\n Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y.\n\n Eliminated letters: \n From guess1: S, L, T, E\n From guess2: M, N, O, R\n From guess3: W, C, K\n Total eliminated: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K\n\n Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Z\n\n Also, note that we know two letters: A (position 2) and Y (position 5).

We need a word of the form ?A??Y.\n\n Some common words:\n - ""HAPPY"": but H, A, P, P, Y -> but it has P twice and P is allowed? But note ""HAPPY"": H (pos1), A (pos2), P (pos3), P (pos2 of the same? No, positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:Y). But P is available. However, we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? In Wordle, repeated letters are allowed. However, for maximizing information, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.\n\n But let\'s check against eliminated: H and P are available? Yes, since eliminated are S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K. So H and P are allowed.\n\n However, the feedback for the third guess did not indicate any repeated letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have fixed positions for A and Y, and we don\'t have information about the other positions.\n\n But ""HAPPY"" has two P\'s, which might not be ideal because we are not testing distinct letters. But if the secret word has only one P, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, the feedback will mark each occurrence. For example, if the secret word has at most one P, then one of the P\'s will be marked as absent or present? But we can handle it.\n\n However, let\'s list words without repeats first to test more letters.\n\n Candidates without repeated letters:\n\n - ""DAISY"": but S and I? Wait, S is eliminated. No, S is in the eliminated set.\n\n - ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> but R is eliminated (from guess2).\n\n - ""GAUDY"": G, A, U, D, Y -> letters: G, U, D are available? Let\'s check: G, U, D are not eliminated. So yes: position1: G, position3: U, position4: D -> GAUDY.\n\n - ""HAZEL"": but L and E eliminated? And Z and H available? But L and E are eliminated, so no.\n\n - ""JAZZY"": J, A, Z, Z, Y -> repeated Z. And J, Z available? Yes. But repeats.\n\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.\n\n - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated.\n\n - ""FADGE"": E eliminated.\n\n - ""GAPPY"": G, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.\n\n - ""HAPPY"": repeated P.\n\n - ""DADDY"": D, A, D, D, Y -> repeated D.\n\n - ""PAPPY"": P, A, P, P, Y -> repeated P.\n\n After looking, ""GAUDY"" (meaning ostentatiously showy) is a valid word without repetition. It uses G, U, D.\n\n Other possibilities: \n  ""BAYLY""? Not a word.\n  ""DAUPH""? Not common.\n  ""FAUGH"": F, A, U, G, H -> but then position 3 is U, position 4 is G? And ends with H? But the word must end with Y? So FAUGH is F A U G H -> positions 4 would be G and then H, not Y.\n\n Let\'s try: position1: B, position3: A, position4: D -> BAD? But then the word would be B A ? ? Y. For example, ""BADDY""? Not a word. ""BADGY""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BAILY""? Not common; usually ""Baily"" is a name and might be capitalized.\n\n ""JAGGY"": J, A, G, G, Y -> repeated G.\n\n ""QUAKY"": Q, U, A, K, Y -> but K is eliminated.\n\n ""QUADY"": Q, U, A, D, Y -> but there\'s no such word? Not standard.\n\n ""VAUDY"": V, A, U, D, Y -> same as ""GAUDY"" but with V. Is ""VAUDY"" a word? I don\'t think so.\n\n ""GAUDY"" is a valid word.\n\n Another word: ""DADDY"" but repeated D\'s.\n\n How about ""BAGGY"": repeated G.\n\n ""HAVOC"": but O and C eliminated? O and C are eliminated.\n\n ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> but E is eliminated.\n\n ""WAVED"": W is eliminated?

I think not.\n\n ""GUILD"": but ends with D, not Y.\n\n After careful thought, ""GAUDY"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It has distinct letters: G, U, D (and A and Y which are fixed and known).\n   - The word is valid.\n\n But note: there might be other words. Let me think of more:\n   ""FADGY""? Not a word.\n   ""GAMBY""? Not a word.\n\n Another possibility: ""BACDY"" no.\n   ""DAVY"": only four letters.\n\n We might consider words with repeated letters if necessary, but we can try GAUDY first.\n\n Therefore, we\'ll guess ""GAUDY"".\n\n One more: ""GAUMY"": G, A, U, M, Y -> but M is eliminated?

A ? D Y\n\n We can list possible words:\n\n - ""BADLY"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.\n - ""FADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.\n - ""HADAL"": but L is eliminated -> invalid.\n - ""JADED"": but E is eliminated -> invalid.\n - ""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> but this has two D\'s? The pattern requires position 4 to be D, so the word would be P A D D Y? But then position 3 is D? But we have position 3 as the third letter. So ""PADDY"" is P (1), A (2), D (3), D (4), Y (5). But in our pattern, position 3 is unknown and position 4 is D. So if we have D in position 3, that would be a different letter. However, the feedback for ""gaudy"" had D in position 4 (correct). So the secret word has D in position 4. But it might have D in other positions? We don\'t know. However, in ""PADDY"", there is a D in position 3 and 4. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two D\'s.\n\n But note: in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D(✓) for position 4. That only tells us that there is a D in position 4. It doesn\'t tell us about other D\'s. So it\'s possible that the word has another D.\n\n However, we must avoid eliminated letters. ""PADDY"" has P, A, D, D, Y. The letters are P, A, D, Y. A and D and Y are known to be in the word. P is available. But note: we have eliminated G and U, but P is not eliminated. So ""PADDY"" is a candidate.\n\n But let\'s check the pattern: \n   Position 1: P\n   Position 2: A (correct)\n   Position 3: D -> but we don\'t know if D is in position 3? The feedback from ""gaudy"" only confirmed D in position 4. It didn\'t say anything about position 3. So if the secret word is ""PADDY"", then position 3 is D, which is a new position for D. But we haven\'t tested D in position 3 before? In ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4, so we know D is in the word and in position 4. But if the secret word has D in position 3 as well, then when we guessed ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 (correct) and we didn\'t have a D in position 3? Actually, in ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and no D in position 3? So if the secret word has D in position 3, then in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we would have seen a \'-\' for the D in position 3? But we didn\'t have a D in position 3 in ""gaudy"". We had U in position 3. So we don\'t have information about D in position 3.\n\n Therefore, ""PADDY"" is a possibility.\n\n But note: we are trying to find the word. We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3. And we know the word must have a D in position 4 and Y in 5, A in 2.\n\n Another candidate: ""HADED"": but E is eliminated.\n\n ""JADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""NADIR"": N eliminated.\n\n ""RADII"": R eliminated.\n\n ""VADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""WADED"": W eliminated and E.\n\n ""BADDY"": B, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY but with B. Is ""BADDY"" a word? Not common, but ""baddy"" is an informal term for a villain. So it might be accepted.\n\n But we have to use valid words. Let\'s assume both ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are acceptable? But ""BADDY"" is sometimes spelled with a \'y\'. However, we\'ll stick to common words.\n\n Another word: ""FADGY""? Not a word.\n\n ""HADJI"": H, A, D, J, I -> but then the word would be H A D J I? But we need the fourth letter to be D? In ""HADJI"", the letters are: H(1), A(2), D(3), J(4), I(5). But we need position 4 to be D, but in ""HADJI"" position 4 is J. So that doesn\'t match.\n\n We need position 4 to be D. So the word must have the fourth letter as D.\n\n How about ""HANDY"": but N is eliminated.\n\n ""PANDY"": P, A, N, D, Y -> but N is eliminated.\n\n ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.\n\n ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.\n\n ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.\n\n ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.\n\n ""JADES"": J, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.\n\n ""FADES"": F, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.\n\n ""HADES"": H, A, D, E, S -> E and S eliminated.\n\n ""JAPED"": J, A, P, E, D -> E eliminated.\n\n ""CAPED"": C and E eliminated.\n\n ""TAPED"": T and E eliminated.\n\n ""VAPID"": V, A, P, I, D -> but then the word is V A P I D -> positions: 1:V, 2:A, 3:P, 4:I, 5:D -> but we need position 4 to be D? Here position 4 is I and position 5 is D. So it doesn\'t match.\n\n We need the fourth letter to be D and the fifth to be Y. So the word must end with ""DY"".\n\n Therefore, the only possibilities are words that have the pattern: [1] A [3] D Y\n\n And [1] and [3] must be from the available letters (B,F,H,I,J,P,Q,V,X,Z) and not eliminated.\n\n We already considered ""PADDY"" and ""BADDY"". \n\n What about ""FADDY""? F, A, D, D, Y -> same as PADDY. Is ""FADDY"" a word? It means someone who has fads? It\'s a word.\n\n Also, ""HADDY""? Not common.\n\n ""JADDY""? Not common.\n\n ""QADDI""? Not a word.\n\n ""VADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""ZADDY""? Slang, but might be accepted.\n\n But let\'s look for more common words.\n\n Another word: ""BADGE"" -> E eliminated.\n\n How about ""PAGED"": E eliminated.\n\n We are running out of options.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the letter in position 3 might be the same as D? But we already have D in position 4. So if we put D in position 3, then the word has two D\'s.\n\n The available letters for position 3: we can use D? But we haven\'t eliminated D? We know D is in the word (in position 4), but we can use it again? Yes, if the word has two D\'s.\n\n But in the feedback for ""gaudy"", we had D in position 4 and it was correct. We didn\'t have a D in position 3, so we don\'t know if there is a D in position 3. So it\'s possible.\n\n Therefore, the candidates are:\n   ""BADDY"", ""FADDY"", ""PADDY"", etc.\n\n But we also have to consider that position 3 might be a different letter.\n\n For example, what if position 3 is not D? Then the word is [1] A [3] D Y, and [3] is not D. What words are there?\n\n For instance, ""HARDY"": but R is eliminated.\n\n ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.\n\n ""FARDY"": F, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.\n\n ""JARDY"": J, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.\n\n ""PARDY"": P, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.\n\n ""VARDY"": V, A, R, D, Y -> R eliminated.\n\n ""BANDY"": N eliminated.\n\n ""CANDY"": C and N eliminated.\n\n ""HANDY"": N eliminated.\n\n ""MANDY"": M and N eliminated.\n\n ""RANDY"": R and N eliminated.\n\n ""SANDY"": S and N eliminated.\n\n ""WANDY"": W and N eliminated.\n\n ""JADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""FADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""HADED"": E eliminated.\n\n ""NADIA"": N and I? But the word must end with DY? ""NADIA"" ends with IA.\n\n So it seems that the only possibilities are words with two D\'s: one in position 4 and one in position 3? Or perhaps position 1?\n\n But the pattern is [1] A [3] D Y. So if we have a D in position 1, then the word is D A [3] D Y. Then position 1 is D and position 4 is D. That\'s two D\'s. But we haven\'t tried D in position 1. Is there a word ""DADDY""? Yes, ""DADDY"".\n\n And ""DADDY"" is a common word.\n\n So let\'s list the candidates with two D\'s:\n\n   ""DADDY"": D(1), A(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but wait, that\'s three D\'s? No: D (position1), A (2), D (3), D (4) -> that\'s three D\'s? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. But we have two D\'s in positions 3 and 4? That\'s two consecutive D\'s? Actually, it\'s D-A-D-D-Y, so the third and fourth letters are both D? That doesn\'t match the pattern because we have position 3 and 4: we need position 3 to be a letter and position 4 to be D. In ""DADDY"", position 3 is D and position 4 is D. So it fits the pattern: [1]=D, [2]=A, [3]=D, [4]=D, [5]=Y. But we have D in position 4? Yes. And we have D in position 3 as well.\n\n But note: we have eliminated many letters, but D is not eliminated. We know D is in the word (from guess4) and it\'s in position 4. So ""DADDY"" has D in positions 1, 3, and 4? That\'s three D\'s? Actually, no: the word ""daddy"" has three D\'s? Let me spell: D-A-D-D-Y -> that\'s D at position 1, 3, and 4? Yes, three D\'s. But that\'s possible? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters.\n\n However, we don\'t know if the secret word has three D\'s. But we haven\'t ruled it out.\n\n But let\'s check the pattern: we need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be Y. ""DADDY"" satisfies that.\n\n But we also have ""PADDY"": P-A-D-D-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:D, 4:D, 5:Y. So two D\'s: positions 3 and 4.\n\n Similarly, ""BADDY"": B-A-D-D-Y.\n\n And ""FADDY"": F-A-D-D-Y.\n\n And ""DADDY"": D-A-D-D-Y.\n\n Now, which one to choose? We need to test position 1 and position 3.\n\n But note: in ""gaudy"", we had G in position 1 (which was wrong) and U in position 3 (wrong). So we don\'t have information about position 1 and 3.\n\n We have to guess one of these.\n\n But we can choose a word that tests new letters. For example, if we choose ""DADDY"", we are testing D in position 1 and 3. But we already know D is in the word (in position 4). So if we get feedback for ""DADDY"", we might get:\n\n   Position1: D -> if it\'s present? But we don\'t know if there is a D in position 1. Similarly, position3: D -> we don\'t know.\n\n However, we are limited by the available words.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have two D\'s? But we couldn\'t find any without two D\'s that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word with two D\'s (or three) that fits the pattern.\n\n Let\'s list the candidates again:\n\n   ""BADDY"": B in position1, D in position3, D in position4, Y in5.\n   ""DADDY"": D in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.\n   ""FADDY"": F in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.\n   ""PADDY"": P in1, D in3, D in4, Y in5.\n\n We also have ""HADDY""? Not common. ""JADDY""? Not common. ""VADDY""? Not common. ""ZADDY""? Slang.\n\n So among B, D, F, P for position1.\n\n We have to pick one. We can choose the most common word: ""DADDY"" or ""PADDY"".\n\n But note: we have not used B, F, P, etc. We want to maximize information? But we are at the fifth guess? We have two guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 5? The previous were 4 guesses? So we have two more guesses? But we want to solve it.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a new letter in position1 and position3? But position3 is D in all these candidates. So we are only testing position1.\n\n So if we choose ""BADDY"", we test B in position1 and D in position3 (but we already know D is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that would be new information? But we know D is in position4, so if we get a ✓ for D in position3, that means there is another D? But we are putting D in position3 and position4. The feedback will tell us if position3 is correct or not.\n\n However, we are forced to have D in position3? Because we are using words that have D in position3? But is that necessary?\n\n Let me think again: is there a word that has position3 not D? We couldn\'t find one. So it seems that the only words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters are the ones with D in position3 and position4.\n\n Therefore, we must choose one of these.\n\n I\'ll go with ""PADDY"" because it\'s a common word.\n\n But note: in ""PADDY"", we have P in position1 and D in position3 and4.\n\n We\'ll guess ""PADDY"".\n\n<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- The secret word is `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).\n- Eliminated letters: **S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U**.\n- Available letters for positions 1 and 3: **B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z**.\n\nGiven the pattern and constraints:\n- Position 3 must be filled, and the only feasible words found have D in position 3 (e.g., ""paddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"", ""daddy"") because no valid words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that avoid eliminated letters and fit the pattern.\n- ""paddy"" is a common word that fits:\n  - A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5.\n  - Tests P (position 1) and D (position 3).\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>paddy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ D Y` (A in position 2, D in position 4, Y in position 5).\n- **Eliminated letters**: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U (not in the word).\n- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: B, F, H, I, J, P, Q, V, X, Z.\n\nAfter analyzing possible words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters, the only feasible candidates are words with **D in position 3** (since no valid English words exist with a non-D letter in position 3 that meet the constraints). The remaining options are:\n- `PADDY` (P in position 1, D in position 3)\n- `BADDY` (B in position 1, D in position 3)\n- `FADDY` (F in position 1, D in position 3)\n- `DADDY` (D in position 1 and 3)\n\nTo maximize information and prioritize common words, **PADDY** is selected. It tests:\n- P (new letter) in position 1.\n- D (known letter) in position 3 (new position).\n\n<guess>paddy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: manor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(x) O(x) R(x)\nGuess 3: wacky -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: gaudy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: paddy -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the fifth guess ""paddy"":
P(x) -> P is not in the secret word.
A(✓) -> A is correct in position 2 (known).
D(✓) for the first D (position 3) -> D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
D(✓) for the second D (position 4) -> D is also in the secret word and in the correct position? But wait, there are two D's in ""paddy"": one at position 3 and one at position 4. The feedback says D(✓) for both? Actually, let's break it down:

The guess was P A D D Y:
- Position 1: P -> (x)
- Position 2: A -> (✓)
- Position 3: D -> (✓)  [so D is correct at position 3]
- Position 4: D -> (✓)  [so D is also correct at position 4? But that would require two D's? Or is it the same D?]

But note: in Wordle, if there are multiple occurrences of a letter, they can be both marked correct if they are in the correct positions. But here, the feedback clearly marked D at position 3 as (✓) and D at position 4 as (✓), meaning both are in the correct positions.

Therefore, the secret word has D in both position 3 and position 4? That would be a word ending with ""DDY"", and with A in position 2.

But wait, we already have pattern: _ A _ D Y. But now from feedback, the third letter is also D? So the secret word is _ A D D Y?

Because: 
- Position 3: D (correct) 
- Position 4: D (correct)

So the pattern is [1] A D D Y.

And from the feedback, P is not in the word (x).

So the word is in the form ? A D D Y.

And we know:
- The first letter is not P, and must be from the available letters (excluding eliminated ones).
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U, and now P.
  So total eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K,G,U,P.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (and also A,D,Y are known but A and D are fixed).

Now, we have to choose a word of the form [1] A D D Y.

What are the words that end with ""ADDY""? 

- ""BADDY"" (variant of baddie)
- ""FADDY"" (faddish person)
- ""HADDY""? Not common.
- ""CADDY""? But C is eliminated (from guess3).
- ""DADDY"" (which is common, but we eliminated D? No, D is already in the word, but we can use it? Actually, we are using D in position 1. But D is not eliminated because in guess4, D was found in position 4, but we don't know if there are more D's.)

But wait, ""DADDY"" would be D A D D Y -> so position 1: D, position 2: A, position 3: D, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""BADDY"" and ""FADDY"" also fit.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The available ones for the first position are B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (and also D? We haven't eliminated D; we only know that D is in the word, but we haven't guessed D in the first position before? So D is still available).

Therefore, the candidates are:
- ""BADDY""
- ""DADDY""
- ""FADDY""
- ""HADDY""? (less common)
- ""JADDY""? Not common.
- ""VADDY""? Not common.
- ... and others.

We have three common ones: ""BADDY"", ""DADDY"", ""FADDY"".

We have guessed ""PADDY"" already and P is eliminated. So ""DADDY"" and ""FADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are available.

We are on the sixth guess (we have one more try after this, but we hope to solve it now).

We need to guess among these.

How to choose? We can choose the most common word. ""DADDY"" is very common.

But note: we haven't tried D in position 1. It is possible. We also haven't tried F or B.

We can try ""DADDY"" because D is already known to be in the word (in positions 3 and 4), but we don't know if it is in position 1? So we are testing that.

Alternatively, we can think about the feedback from earlier.

Recall guess1: ""slate"" had A in the word but wrong position. We thought A was not in position 3. Now, in the secret word, A is in position 2 (correct), so that is consistent.

No other clues.

I think ""DADDY"" is the most common word.

But wait: the secret word might be ""BADDY"" or ""FADDY"", but ""DADDY"" is more frequent.

Therefore, we'll guess ""DADDY"".

But let's confirm: 
With ""DADDY"": 
  Position 1: D -> if the secret word is ""DADDY"", it will be ✓. Otherwise, if the secret word is ""BADDY"", then D would be not in the word? But wait, if we guess ""DADDY"" and the secret word is ""BADDY"", then:
  Position 1: D is not in the word? But ""BADDY"" does not have D? It has B, A, D, D, Y -> yes, it does have a D, but in positions 3 and 4? Then for position 1: D is expected but actual is B, so it would be 'x' (since B is not D and D is not in the first position? But D is in the word but in other positions). So feedback would be: 
    D (position1): in wrong position? Because the secret word ""BADDY"" has D only in positions 3 and 4? So D is present but not in position1.

Actually, in ""BADDY"", the letters are B, A, D, D, Y. So there is no D in position1? So if we guess ""DADDY"", the first letter D would not be in the secret word? But wait, the secret word has two D's? Then when we input D in position1, it would be marked as present (-) because there is a D in the word? But note: in secret word ""BADDY"", the D's are at positions 3 and 4. We are using two D's? So when we guess ""DADDY"" against ""BADDY"", the feedback should be:

Position 1: D -> not in the secret word (since both D's in the secret word are at 3 and 4? But we are using a D. How does Wordle handle multiple letters?

Rule: For repeated letters, each feedback is independent. In secret word: two D's (positions 3 and 4). In our guess ""DADDY"": D at 1, D at 3, D at 4? That's three D's? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y -> so D at positions 1,3,4.

But the secret word ""BADDY"" has two D's: positions 3 and 4.

Then:
- Position1: D -> the letter D is in the word but not in this position? And since there are two D's already accounted for? Actually, the first D in the guess: the secret word has two D's, but they are both in positions 3 and 4? So for position1, we guess D and it's not present? But the secret word has D's? So because there is a D, but the first occurrence in the guess is not matching, so it could be marked as present if there are unmatched D's? But wait: in Wordle, suppose secret word has two D's. When you guess a D, it uses one occurrence. So for ""DADDY"" vs ""BADDY"":

  Position1: D -> there is a D in the secret word? Yes, but it's in positions 3 and 4. However, since we haven't matched them yet, the first D might be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? But note: in Wordle's feedback, if the secret has two D's, and you guess D in a position where there is no D, then it gets a '-' if there is an unmatched D? But then for position1: D is not in the secret word in position1, but the secret word has D's? So it should be '-'. Then at position3: D -> correct (✓) because it matches? Then at position4: D -> correct (✓)? Then also, we have two D's in the secret word? And we have guessed three D's? So one D is extra? But Wordle marks each individually.

In this case:
  Position1: D -> '-' (because D is in secret but not at position1)
  Position2: A -> ✓
  Position3: D -> ✓ (matches)
  Position4: D -> ✓ (matches)
  Position5: Y -> ✓

But wait, the secret word ""BADDY"" has only two D's? So after matching position3 and position4, both are ✓, so the two D's are accounted for. Then the D at position1 in the guess would be considered an extra D? So it shouldn't be marked as present? It should be 'x'. Actually, Wordle handles multiple occurrences precisely: for a letter that appears multiple times, the feedback is given by matching exact positions first, then the remaining unmatched occurrences.

In this case, secret: B A D D Y

Compare guess: D A D D Y

- Position3: D matches secret (exact) -> mark as ✓
- Position4: D matches secret (exact) -> mark as ✓
Now, the guess has a D at position1. The secret has no more D's (since both are used). So position1: D -> x.

Therefore, feedback would be: D(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)

But note: the D at position3 and4 are both correct. The D at position1 is incorrect.

So we would get: D(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)

But in our previous guess ""paddy"", we already had two D's? And now we are guessing three D's? But we don't know.

In our case, we have to guess the word. We know the pattern is [1] A D D Y.

The common words are ""daddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"".

We are on guess 6 (out of 6), so we have to get it right.

If we guess ""daddy"" and the secret is ""baddy"", we get it wrong. So better to guess systematically.

How about the available letters? We haven't tested B, F, D in position1. We could guess ""DADDY"", and if it's wrong, we lose? Because it's the last guess? We are on guess 6? The user asked for guess 6? This is guess 6.

The sequence:
  Guess1: slate
  Guess2: manor
  Guess3: wack
  So this is the fifth? No, we made guess5: paddy. The previous response was feedback for guess5. So this is guess6.

We have one guess left.

We need to guess correctly.

So we have to choose among the candidates: ""BADDY"", ""DADDY"", ""FADDY"".

We don't have information to distinguish them? Except that we haven't tested B, F, D in position1.

But we don't have another guess after this to correct.

Therefore, we must pick one.

"" DADDY"" is the most common one. So we'll guess that.

But let me confirm: the secret word could be ""baddy"" or ""faddy"", but ""daddy"" is more frequent.

Alternatively, is there any other word that fits? Like ""HADDY""? Probably not.

So I go with ""DADDY"".

<guess>daddy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ A D D Y` (A in position 2, D in positions 3 and 4, Y in position 5).
- Position 1 must be one of the available letters: B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (since P and all previously eliminated letters are ruled out).
- Common English words fitting this pattern are ""DADDY"", ""BADDY"", and ""FADDY"".

Among these, **""DADDY""** is the most common and frequently used word. It tests:
- D in position 1 (a new position for D, which is already in the word at positions 3–4).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

<guess>daddy</guess>",daddy,"We are given feedback from the fifth guess ""paddy"":
P(x) -> P is not in the secret word.
A(✓) -> A is correct in position 2 (known).
D(✓) for the first D (position 3) -> D is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
D(✓) for the second D (position 4) -> D is also in the secret word and in the correct position? But wait, there are two D's in ""paddy"": one at position 3 and one at position 4. The feedback says D(✓) for both? Actually, let's break it down:

The guess was P A D D Y:
- Position 1: P -> (x)
- Position 2: A -> (✓)
- Position 3: D -> (✓)  [so D is correct at position 3]
- Position 4: D -> (✓)  [so D is also correct at position 4? But that would require two D's? Or is it the same D?]

But note: in Wordle, if there are multiple occurrences of a letter, they can be both marked correct if they are in the correct positions. But here, the feedback clearly marked D at position 3 as (✓) and D at position 4 as (✓), meaning both are in the correct positions.

Therefore, the secret word has D in both position 3 and position 4? That would be a word ending with ""DDY"", and with A in position 2.

But wait, we already have pattern: _ A _ D Y. But now from feedback, the third letter is also D? So the secret word is _ A D D Y?

Because: 
- Position 3: D (correct) 
- Position 4: D (correct)

So the pattern is [1] A D D Y.

And from the feedback, P is not in the word (x).

So the word is in the form ? A D D Y.

And we know:
- The first letter is not P, and must be from the available letters (excluding eliminated ones).
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, E, M, N, O, R, W, C, K, G, U, and now P.
  So total eliminated: S,L,T,E,M,N,O,R,W,C,K,G,U,P.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (and also A,D,Y are known but A and D are fixed).

Now, we have to choose a word of the form [1] A D D Y.

What are the words that end with ""ADDY""? 

- ""BADDY"" (variant of baddie)
- ""FADDY"" (faddish person)
- ""HADDY""? Not common.
- ""CADDY""? But C is eliminated (from guess3).
- ""DADDY"" (which is common, but we eliminated D? No, D is already in the word, but we can use it? Actually, we are using D in position 1. But D is not eliminated because in guess4, D was found in position 4, but we don't know if there are more D's.)

But wait, ""DADDY"" would be D A D D Y -> so position 1: D, position 2: A, position 3: D, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So it fits the pattern.

Similarly, ""BADDY"" and ""FADDY"" also fit.

But note: we have eliminated many letters. The available ones for the first position are B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (and also D? We haven't eliminated D; we only know that D is in the word, but we haven't guessed D in the first position before? So D is still available).

Therefore, the candidates are:
- ""BADDY""
- ""DADDY""
- ""FADDY""
- ""HADDY""? (less common)
- ""JADDY""? Not common.
- ""VADDY""? Not common.
- ... and others.

We have three common ones: ""BADDY"", ""DADDY"", ""FADDY"".

We have guessed ""PADDY"" already and P is eliminated. So ""DADDY"" and ""FADDY"" and ""BADDY"" are available.

We are on the sixth guess (we have one more try after this, but we hope to solve it now).

We need to guess among these.

How to choose? We can choose the most common word. ""DADDY"" is very common.

But note: we haven't tried D in position 1. It is possible. We also haven't tried F or B.

We can try ""DADDY"" because D is already known to be in the word (in positions 3 and 4), but we don't know if it is in position 1? So we are testing that.

Alternatively, we can think about the feedback from earlier.

Recall guess1: ""slate"" had A in the word but wrong position. We thought A was not in position 3. Now, in the secret word, A is in position 2 (correct), so that is consistent.

No other clues.

I think ""DADDY"" is the most common word.

But wait: the secret word might be ""BADDY"" or ""FADDY"", but ""DADDY"" is more frequent.

Therefore, we'll guess ""DADDY"".

But let's confirm: 
With ""DADDY"": 
  Position 1: D -> if the secret word is ""DADDY"", it will be ✓. Otherwise, if the secret word is ""BADDY"", then D would be not in the word? But wait, if we guess ""DADDY"" and the secret word is ""BADDY"", then:
  Position 1: D is not in the word? But ""BADDY"" does not have D? It has B, A, D, D, Y -> yes, it does have a D, but in positions 3 and 4? Then for position 1: D is expected but actual is B, so it would be 'x' (since B is not D and D is not in the first position? But D is in the word but in other positions). So feedback would be: 
    D (position1): in wrong position? Because the secret word ""BADDY"" has D only in positions 3 and 4? So D is present but not in position1.

Actually, in ""BADDY"", the letters are B, A, D, D, Y. So there is no D in position1? So if we guess ""DADDY"", the first letter D would not be in the secret word? But wait, the secret word has two D's? Then when we input D in position1, it would be marked as present (-) because there is a D in the word? But note: in secret word ""BADDY"", the D's are at positions 3 and 4. We are using two D's? So when we guess ""DADDY"" against ""BADDY"", the feedback should be:

Position 1: D -> not in the secret word (since both D's in the secret word are at 3 and 4? But we are using a D. How does Wordle handle multiple letters?

Rule: For repeated letters, each feedback is independent. In secret word: two D's (positions 3 and 4). In our guess ""DADDY"": D at 1, D at 3, D at 4? That's three D's? Actually, ""DADDY"" is D-A-D-D-Y -> so D at positions 1,3,4.

But the secret word ""BADDY"" has two D's: positions 3 and 4.

Then:
- Position1: D -> the letter D is in the word but not in this position? And since there are two D's already accounted for? Actually, the first D in the guess: the secret word has two D's, but they are both in positions 3 and 4? So for position1, we guess D and it's not present? But the secret word has D's? So because there is a D, but the first occurrence in the guess is not matching, so it could be marked as present if there are unmatched D's? But wait: in Wordle, suppose secret word has two D's. When you guess a D, it uses one occurrence. So for ""DADDY"" vs ""BADDY"":

  Position1: D -> there is a D in the secret word? Yes, but it's in positions 3 and 4. However, since we haven't matched them yet, the first D might be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? But note: in Wordle's feedback, if the secret has two D's, and you guess D in a position where there is no D, then it gets a '-' if there is an unmatched D? But then for position1: D is not in the secret word in position1, but the secret word has D's? So it should be '-'. Then at position3: D -> correct (✓) because it matches? Then at position4: D -> correct (✓)? Then also, we have two D's in the secret word? And we have guessed three D's? So one D is extra? But Wordle marks each individually.

In this case:
  Position1: D -> '-' (because D is in secret but not at position1)
  Position2: A -> ✓
  Position3: D -> ✓ (matches)
  Position4: D -> ✓ (matches)
  Position5: Y -> ✓

But wait, the secret word ""BADDY"" has only two D's? So after matching position3 and position4, both are ✓, so the two D's are accounted for. Then the D at position1 in the guess would be considered an extra D? So it shouldn't be marked as present? It should be 'x'. Actually, Wordle handles multiple occurrences precisely: for a letter that appears multiple times, the feedback is given by matching exact positions first, then the remaining unmatched occurrences.

In this case, secret: B A D D Y

Compare guess: D A D D Y

- Position3: D matches secret (exact) -> mark as ✓
- Position4: D matches secret (exact) -> mark as ✓
Now, the guess has a D at position1. The secret has no more D's (since both are used). So position1: D -> x.

Therefore, feedback would be: D(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)

But note: the D at position3 and4 are both correct. The D at position1 is incorrect.

So we would get: D(x) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)

But in our previous guess ""paddy"", we already had two D's? And now we are guessing three D's? But we don't know.

In our case, we have to guess the word. We know the pattern is [1] A D D Y.

The common words are ""daddy"", ""baddy"", ""faddy"".

We are on guess 6 (out of 6), so we have to get it right.

If we guess ""daddy"" and the secret is ""baddy"", we get it wrong. So better to guess systematically.

How about the available letters? We haven't tested B, F, D in position1. We could guess ""DADDY"", and if it's wrong, we lose? Because it's the last guess? We are on guess 6? The user asked for guess 6? This is guess 6.

The sequence:
  Guess1: slate
  Guess2: manor
  Guess3: wack
  So this is the fifth? No, we made guess5: paddy. The previous response was feedback for guess5. So this is guess6.

We have one guess left.

We need to guess correctly.

So we have to choose among the candidates: ""BADDY"", ""DADDY"", ""FADDY"".

We don't have information to distinguish them? Except that we haven't tested B, F, D in position1.

But we don't have another guess after this to correct.

Therefore, we must pick one.

"" DADDY"" is the most common one. So we'll guess that.

But let me confirm: the secret word could be ""baddy"" or ""faddy"", but ""daddy"" is more frequent.

Alternatively, is there any other word that fits? Like ""HADDY""? Probably not.

So I go with ""DADDY"".

<guess>daddy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ A D D Y` (A in position 2, D in positions 3 and 4, Y in position 5).
- Position 1 must be one of the available letters: B, F, H, I, J, Q, V, X, Z (since P and all previously eliminated letters are ruled out).
- Common English words fitting this pattern are ""DADDY"", ""BADDY"", and ""FADDY"".

Among these, **""DADDY""** is the most common and frequently used word. It tests:
- D in position 1 (a new position for D, which is already in the word at positions 3–4).
- Avoids all eliminated letters.",Guess 6: daddy -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) A(✓) D(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
