We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters to get as much information as possible.
 Some common starting words in games like Wordle are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, etc. These words use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"":
   C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.

 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent opener because:
- It contains three common vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C and R, N).
- The letters cover a broad frequency in English 5-letter words.
- This helps reveal positional clues or eliminate multiple letters at once.

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll receive feedback per the rules (✓, -, or x for each letter), which will guide the next guess. For now, since there's no prior information, this is optimal.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position and E in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that helps us identify the remaining letters.

The word pattern: _ R _ _ E

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and doesn't contain C, A, or N.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to use a word that has letters that are common and can appear in the first, third, and fourth positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have R as the second letter.

Some examples: 
- PRICE (but P is new, R is fixed, I is new, C is already excluded -> so we can't use C, so not PRICE)
- BRIDE (B, I, D are new) -> but we have to check if it's valid.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N.

Let me list possible words: 
- BRINE (B, I, N) -> but N is excluded, so no.
- TRIPE (T, I, P) -> T, I, P are new.
- GRIME (G, I, M) -> G, I, M are new.
- WRITE (W, I, T) -> W, I, T are new.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to fill: first, third, and fourth? Actually, the pattern is: first letter, then R (fixed), then third letter, fourth letter, and E (fixed). So we need to guess the first, third, and fourth letters.

We want to maximize information by using new common letters.

Let's try to use a word that has multiple vowels or common consonants in the unknown positions.

Possible words: 
- TRITE (but T repeats, and it might not be the best because of repetition) -> but let's see.
- PRIDE (P, I, D) -> P, I, D are new.
- BRIDE (B, I, D) -> B, I, D are new.

But we don't know if B, I, D, etc. are in the word.

Another idea: use a word that has S, T, L, or O in the unknown positions.

Let me think of: 
- PROSE (P, O, S) -> but O and S are new, and we avoid A, C, N. However, the pattern is _ R _ _ E, so PROSE would be P R O S E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, which matches. But the third letter is O.

But we have to check if it's valid: PROSE is a word.

But we have to avoid using known absent letters: C, A, N are absent, so PROSE doesn't contain them.

Alternatively, we could use: 
- TRADE (but A is excluded, so no)
- GRACE (C and A excluded, so no)

So PROSE is a candidate.

Another candidate: 
- BRUTE (B, U, T) -> B, U, T are new.

But we have two fixed letters: R and E.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the letters we have already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R and E are in the word (with known positions), and C, A, N are out.

So available letters: all except C, A, N.

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test common ones.

I think ""PRIDE"" or ""PROSE"" or ""BRUTE"" are good.

But let me see which one is better.

We have three positions to test: first, third, and fourth.

We can also try to include a vowel in the third position because many words have vowels in the middle.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (since A and E are known: E is in, A is out).

E is in, but we know its position. We haven't tried I, O, U.

So including one of these vowels might be good.

Similarly, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's consider:

- PRIDE: P (consonant), R (fixed), I (vowel), D (consonant), E (fixed). So we test P, I, D.
- PROSE: P, R, O (vowel), S (consonant), E. Tests P, O, S.
- BRUTE: B, R, U (vowel), T (consonant), E. Tests B, U, T.

All are good.

But note that in the third position, we are testing a vowel in each case.

We might also consider ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> tests T, I, P.

Another one: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let me check if there are any constraints I missed.

We must not use the excluded letters: C, A, N.

PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> no C, A, N. Good.

Similarly, PROSE: P, R, O, S, E -> no C, A, N.

I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it has I (a common vowel) and D (common consonant) and P (common consonant).

But note: we are also testing the first position with P and the third with I and fourth with D.

After this, we will get feedback on P, I, D.

So let's choose ""PRIDE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""PRICE""? But we know C is excluded, so it can't be.

Another possibility: ""BRIDE"" is similar but with B.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""PRIDE"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.

So ""PRIDE"" has I, but not T or O or S.

""PROSE"" has O and S.

""TRIPE"" has T and I and P.

But ""TRIPE"" is T R I P E -> which tests T, I, P.

Similarly, ""TRICE"" has C which is excluded.

Another word: ""ROUSE"" -> R O U S E, but R is fixed as second letter? No, in ""ROUSE"", R is the first letter, but we need R as the second letter.

Our pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the first letter is unknown, then R, then third, then fourth, then E.

So ""ROUSE"" doesn't fit because it is R O U S E -> first letter R, but we need R as second.

So we must have a word with the second letter R and fifth letter E.

So ""TRIPE"" fits: T (first) R (second) I (third) P (fourth) E (fifth).

Similarly, ""PROSE"": P (first) R (second) O (third) S (fourth) E (fifth).

""BRUTE"": B (first) R (second) U (third) T (fourth) E (fifth).

I think ""PROSE"" is good because it tests two new vowels? O is a vowel, and S is a common consonant.

But we have already tried E, and A is out, so O and I and U are the main vowels left.

In ""PROSE"", we test P, O, S.

In ""PRIDE"", we test P, I, D.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""PROSE"" because it covers O and S, which are very common.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PROSE"" is a valid word.

So let's choose ""PROSE"".

But wait, what about the word ""ROSE""? It's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

So ""PROSE"" is 5 letters.

Another common word: ""TRACE"" but A and C are excluded.

So I think ""PROSE"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses T and O together? Like ""TROVE"" -> T R O V E, which tests T, O, V. But V is less common.

""STORE"" -> S T O R E, but then R is the fourth letter? We need R as the second letter. So ""STORE"" is S T O R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). But we need the second letter to be R, so it doesn't fit.

So we must have the second letter R.

Therefore, ""PROSE"" is P(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5). Perfect.

Similarly, ""GRISE"" is not common.

I think ""PROSE"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N. 

For the next guess:
- We need to avoid using C, A, or N.
- We should prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D) to gather more information about the first, third, and fourth positions.
- The word ""prose"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E) and includes new common letters: P (first position), O (third position), and S (fourth position). This will help test multiple high-frequency letters at once.

So including one of these vowels might be good.

Similarly, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's consider:

- PROSE: P, R, O (vowel), S (consonant), E. Tests P, O, S.
- BRUTE: B, R, U (vowel), T (consonant), E. Tests B, U, T.

All are good.

But note that in the third position, we are testing a vowel in each case.

We might also consider ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> tests T, I, P.

""TRIPE"" has T and I and P.

But ""TRIPE"" is T R I P E -> which tests T, I, P.

Similarly, ""TRICE"" has C which is excluded.

Another word: ""ROUSE"" -> R O U S E, but R is fixed as second letter? No, in ""ROUSE"", R is the first letter, but we need R as the second letter.

Our pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the first letter is unknown, then R, then third, then fourth, then E.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want a word that covers common letters to get as much information as possible.
 Some common starting words in games like Wordle are: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, etc. These words use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"":
   C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.

 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent opener because:
- It contains three common vowels (A and E) and two common consonants (C and R, N).
- The letters cover a broad frequency in English 5-letter words.
- This helps reveal positional clues or eliminate multiple letters at once.

After submitting ""CRANE"", I'll receive feedback per the rules (✓, -, or x for each letter), which will guide the next guess. For now, since there's no prior information, this is optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position and E in the fifth position. So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

We must avoid using C, A, and N in our next guess.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that helps us identify the remaining letters.

The word pattern: _ R _ _ E

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern and doesn't contain C, A, or N.

We also want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to use a word that has letters that are common and can appear in the first, third, and fourth positions.

Let's think of words that end with E and have R as the second letter.

Some examples: 
- PRICE (but P is new, R is fixed, I is new, C is already excluded -> so we can't use C, so not PRICE)
- BRIDE (B, I, D are new) -> but we have to check if it's valid.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N.

Let me list possible words: 
- BRINE (B, I, N) -> but N is excluded, so no.
- TRIPE (T, I, P) -> T, I, P are new.
- GRIME (G, I, M) -> G, I, M are new.
- WRITE (W, I, T) -> W, I, T are new.

But we also have to consider that we have two positions to fill: first, third, and fourth? Actually, the pattern is: first letter, then R (fixed), then third letter, fourth letter, and E (fixed). So we need to guess the first, third, and fourth letters.

We want to maximize information by using new common letters.

Let's try to use a word that has multiple vowels or common consonants in the unknown positions.

Possible words: 
- TRITE (but T repeats, and it might not be the best because of repetition) -> but let's see.
- PRIDE (P, I, D) -> P, I, D are new.
- BRIDE (B, I, D) -> B, I, D are new.

But we don't know if B, I, D, etc. are in the word.

Another idea: use a word that has S, T, L, or O in the unknown positions.

Let me think of: 
- PROSE (P, O, S) -> but O and S are new, and we avoid A, C, N. However, the pattern is _ R _ _ E, so PROSE would be P R O S E -> but the fourth letter is S and fifth is E, which matches. But the third letter is O.

But we have to check if it's valid: PROSE is a word.

But we have to avoid using known absent letters: C, A, N are absent, so PROSE doesn't contain them.

Alternatively, we could use: 
- TRADE (but A is excluded, so no)
- GRACE (C and A excluded, so no)

So PROSE is a candidate.

Another candidate: 
- BRUTE (B, U, T) -> B, U, T are new.

But we have two fixed letters: R and E.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the letters we have already tried: C, R, A, N, E. So we know R and E are in the word (with known positions), and C, A, N are out.

So available letters: all except C, A, N.

We can use: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test common ones.

I think ""PRIDE"" or ""PROSE"" or ""BRUTE"" are good.

But let me see which one is better.

We have three positions to test: first, third, and fourth.

We can also try to include a vowel in the third position because many words have vowels in the middle.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (since A and E are known: E is in, A is out).

E is in, but we know its position. We haven't tried I, O, U.

So including one of these vowels might be good.

Similarly, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's consider:

- PRIDE: P (consonant), R (fixed), I (vowel), D (consonant), E (fixed). So we test P, I, D.
- PROSE: P, R, O (vowel), S (consonant), E. Tests P, O, S.
- BRUTE: B, R, U (vowel), T (consonant), E. Tests B, U, T.

All are good.

But note that in the third position, we are testing a vowel in each case.

We might also consider ""TRIPE"": T, R, I, P, E -> tests T, I, P.

Another one: ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let me check if there are any constraints I missed.

We must not use the excluded letters: C, A, N.

PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> no C, A, N. Good.

Similarly, PROSE: P, R, O, S, E -> no C, A, N.

I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it has I (a common vowel) and D (common consonant) and P (common consonant).

But note: we are also testing the first position with P and the third with I and fourth with D.

After this, we will get feedback on P, I, D.

So let's choose ""PRIDE"".

But wait, what if the word is ""PRICE""? But we know C is excluded, so it can't be.

Another possibility: ""BRIDE"" is similar but with B.

I think either is fine.

I'll choose ""PRIDE"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but A and N are out, so T, O, I, S are good.

So ""PRIDE"" has I, but not T or O or S.

""PROSE"" has O and S.

""TRIPE"" has T and I and P.

But ""TRIPE"" is T R I P E -> which tests T, I, P.

Similarly, ""TRICE"" has C which is excluded.

Another word: ""ROUSE"" -> R O U S E, but R is fixed as second letter? No, in ""ROUSE"", R is the first letter, but we need R as the second letter.

Our pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the first letter is unknown, then R, then third, then fourth, then E.

So ""ROUSE"" doesn't fit because it is R O U S E -> first letter R, but we need R as second.

So we must have a word with the second letter R and fifth letter E.

So ""TRIPE"" fits: T (first) R (second) I (third) P (fourth) E (fifth).

Similarly, ""PROSE"": P (first) R (second) O (third) S (fourth) E (fifth).

""BRUTE"": B (first) R (second) U (third) T (fourth) E (fifth).

I think ""PROSE"" is good because it tests two new vowels? O is a vowel, and S is a common consonant.

But we have already tried E, and A is out, so O and I and U are the main vowels left.

In ""PROSE"", we test P, O, S.

In ""PRIDE"", we test P, I, D.

I think both are fine. I'll go with ""PROSE"" because it covers O and S, which are very common.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""PROSE"" is a valid word.

So let's choose ""PROSE"".

But wait, what about the word ""ROSE""? It's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

So ""PROSE"" is 5 letters.

Another common word: ""TRACE"" but A and C are excluded.

So I think ""PROSE"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses T and O together? Like ""TROVE"" -> T R O V E, which tests T, O, V. But V is less common.

""STORE"" -> S T O R E, but then R is the fourth letter? We need R as the second letter. So ""STORE"" is S T O R E -> positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5). But we need the second letter to be R, so it doesn't fit.

So we must have the second letter R.

Therefore, ""PROSE"" is P(1), R(2), O(3), S(4), E(5). Perfect.

Similarly, ""GRISE"" is not common.

I think ""PROSE"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct second position (marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the correct fifth position (marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E, and it does not contain C, A, or N. 

For the next guess:
- We need to avoid using C, A, or N.
- We should prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, L, D) to gather more information about the first, third, and fourth positions.
- The word ""prose"" fits the pattern (_ R _ _ E) and includes new common letters: P (first position), O (third position), and S (fourth position). This will help test multiple high-frequency letters at once.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- So we know:
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
And it does not contain C, A, or N.

Guess 2: ""prose"" -> P(-), R(✓), O(x), S(x), E(✓)
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be either in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: the feedback says P(-), meaning P is present but not in position 1. Since we guessed P in position 1 and it's marked as (-), that means P is in the word but not at position 1. Also, since the pattern has positions 3 and 4 unknown, P could be in position 3 or 4 of the secret word.
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Add to the exclusions: O and S are not in the word.

So now, we know:
- The word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
- Present letters: R (pos2), E (pos5), and P (somewhere, but not pos1). Also from ""crane"", R and E are present.

So the word must contain P, and it is in position 3 or 4 (since pos2 is R and pos5 is E, and pos1 is not P as per feedback).

Therefore, possible positions for P: 3 or 4.

We also have to find the first letter and the remaining middle letter.

Now, we know the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, O, S

And the known present letters: R, E, P. But E and R positions are fixed, so P is additional and must be placed.

Now, what letters have we not tried? From the common ones, we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, P, O, S.

So untried common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, T, U, W, etc.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Does not use C, A, N, O, S
- Must include P if we haven't confirmed its position? Actually, no, the guess doesn't have to include P because we can use other letters to test. But since P is in the word, we should try to use it? Not necessarily. We can make a guess that helps find the first letter and the other middle letter without P, to narrow down possibilities.

But let's think about possible words that fit the pattern and satisfy the constraints.

The word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

And must contain P, which must be either letter3 or letter4.

So possible:

- If P is letter3: then pattern: _ R P _ E
- If P is letter4: then pattern: _ R _ P E

Also, letter1 must be one of the not-excluded letters, and similarly for the remaining letter.

But we don't know which one.

Also, in the guess, we can try a word that tests one of these cases and also tests other possible letters.

For example, we could try a word where P is in position 3 or 4, and also uses new letters for the other positions.

Case 1: Assume P is in position 3. Then the word is _ R P _ E.

What could be the first and fourth letters? First letter not excluded, fourth letter not excluded.

Possible words: 
- GRIPE? But G is not excluded. GRIPE would be G R I P E -> but we have to avoid O,S,A,C,N? Yes.
- But what about feedback? We will get clues.

Case 2: Assume P is in position 4. Then _ R _ P E.

Possible words: CRUMP? But C is excluded. Or TRUMP? T R U M P -> but the fifth letter is P? We need fifth to be E. Pattern is E at end. So TRUMP doesn't end with E. So not.

The word must end with E.

So for _ R _ P E: the third letter is a letter, then P and E.

But there are not many words ending with ""PE"".

For example: GRAPE? But A is excluded. GRIPE is not ending with PE, GRIPE ends with E but the P is third? GRIPE: G R I P E -> so letter4 is P? Yes, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E.

So GRIPE has pattern _ R _ _ E with P at position 4.

Similarly, for P at position 3: TRIPE? T R I P E -> P at position 4 again? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E -> so P is at position 4? Not position 3.

To have P at position 3: we need a word like _ R P?E. For example: ""RAPSE"" but R is not first, and A excluded. Not many common words.

Perhaps ""AMPLE"" but A excluded, and P is position 2? Not.

For P in position 3: example words? 
- RIPED? But not a word, usually ""riped"" is not common. 
- ""CRIMP"" but C excluded and no E. 
- ""TRIBE"" but P not there. 

Actually, let's find words with pattern _ R P _ E. It might be rare.

More common: words with P in position 4: like GRIPE, TRIPE, STRIPE (but S excluded), TRIPE is T R I P E.

Also: DRIPE? Not a word.

So common one: GRIPE, TRIPE.

But TRIPE has T, R, I, P, E.

Similarly, GRIPE has G, R, I, P, E.

Now, we also could have P in position 1? But feedback from ""prose"" said P(-) meaning P is not position 1 and also not correct position, so it could be position 3 or 4. Position 1 is not allowed since we guessed it in position 1 and it's wrong.

In fact, the feedback P(-) indicates that P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, let's see what other words fit the pattern without including O,S,A,C,N.

For the guess, we could try ""gripe"" or ""tripe"" to test one of these possibilities.

But note: if we try ""gripe"", we will test:
- G as first letter (new)
- R fixed ✓
- I as third letter (new)
- P as fourth letter (we know P is in the word, so this might be correct position or not? We don't know if it's position 3 or 4 yet.)

Similarly, ""tripe"" would test T and I.

But we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Another idea: since P is present, we can try to guess a word that puts P in position 4, and tests a different third letter and first letter.

For example, ""gripe"" tests G and I.

""tripe"" tests T and I.

But I is common, so we might get clues on I.

We could try a word that uses a different vowel, like U.

For example, BRUTE? But we don't have P. And O is out, but U is in? But we need to include P? No, not necessary for the guess to include P, as we are allowed to make any guess.

But since P is confirmed in the word, if we don't include P, then we must be careful not to waste positions.

For example, we can guess a word without P to test other letters.

But we know P is present, so by including P, we can try to pin down its position.

But let's think of the options.

Option 1: Guess a word that puts P in position 4 and tests I in position 3 and a new first letter. Words: gripe, tripe.

Option 2: Guess a word that puts P in position 3, but as we saw, it's harder. For example: ""ripen"" but R is fixed at position 2? And N excluded, and E fixed at end. ""RIPEN"" is R I P E N -> not E at end? Ends with N. And pattern must have R at pos2 and E at pos5, so RIPEN is R at 1? Not.

Actually, ""URPOSE"" not 5 letters.

So perhaps P in position 3 is not common. After some thought, it's more likely P is in position 4.

So let's assume P is in position 4 for now, so the word is _ R _ P E.

Then the missing letters are first position and third position.

The third position could be a vowel or consonant, and first is any letter not excluded.

We have eliminated O, S, A, C, N.

Possible vowels for third position: E is used at end, so probably not, and A is out, O out, so I or U are likely.

Consonants possible.

In the guess, we can choose a word that tests possible candidates for first and third.

For example, if we pick ""tripe"", we test T for first and I for third.

But we don't know if T is present or not.

We could try ""prime"": P R I M E -> but pattern: P at pos1, but we know P cannot be pos1 because from feedback P(-) in position 1. And also the word would start with P, but we need _ R? So ""prime"" has R in position 2? Yes: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But M at pos4? We are testing P at position 1? But we know P is not pos1, so if we guess ""prime"", we would be putting P in position 1 again, which we know is wrong. So it might be inefficient.

Moreover, having P in pos1 would likely get (-) or (x), but we know P is present so (-) if not other positions.

But we already know P is not pos1, so it's better to avoid that.

Therefore, we should avoid putting P in position 1.

Similarly, in positions 2 and 5 we have fixed R and E.

So best to put P in either position 3 or 4 in our guess to try to get its correct position.

Since one of these is likely to be correct.

For the guess, let's try putting P in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 1 and position 3.

For example, use ""TRIPE"": 
- T for first position (test if T is in word and correct position or not)
- R fixed
- I for third position (test if I is in word and if at third or elsewhere)
- P for fourth position (we know P is present, so if we get ✓, then position 4 is correct; if (-), then P is at position 3; if x, impossible since P is present)
- Then E fixed.

In this guess, we can have outcomes:
- If the I at third position is correct, we get ✓ for I.
- Similarly for T and P.

Another candidate: ""PRUDE""? P at first? But P cannot be first.

""DRIVE"" but no P, and we want to include P? Not necessary.

But to be efficient, let's choose ""TRIPE"".

But note, we have not tried T and I before.

Another word: ""GRIPE"" with G.

I think both are fine. Let's pick ""TRIPE"".

Then, if feedback shows:
- T: if present, etc.
- I: similarly.

But we also need to consider if there are words that use letters that are more common.

T is very common, I is common vowel.

So ""TRIPE"" is a good choice.

We could try ""TRIBE"", but P is not included? But we know P must be in the word, so if we guess ""TRIBE"", which has no P, then letters T,R,I,B,E.

But E and R are known and fixed, so B and I are new.

But since P is missing, we will get all feedback, but if the word had P, ""TRIBE"" would get P missing? But we know P is present, so ""TRIBE"" cannot be the word because it doesn't have P? Not necessarily; we are not guessing the word, we are guessing to get clues.

But the word contains P, so if we guess ""TRIBE"", the feedback will mark I and B accordingly, and for P, it would not be there? No: since we didn't guess P, we get no feedback for P, but we already know P is present.

It might be inefficient because we are not narrowing down P's position.

For example, if we guess ""TRIBE"", the word is _ R _ _ E with T in first, I in third, B in fourth, E fifth.

Feedback:
- T: if present and correct position or not.
- R: ✓, of course.
- I: present or not, and position.
- B: present or not, and position.
- E: ✓.

But since we know the word has P not in first, but present, so if B or I is not P, we don't learn directly about P's position.

For instance, if P is in position 4, and we put B in pos4, we might get B(x) or something, but unclear.

Whereas if we include P, we get direct feedback.

So it's better to include P in the guess.

Thus, I think ""TRIPE"" is a reasonable guess.

So let's go with that.

<guess>tripe</guess> 

But let's confirm the format.

Another possibility: since P might be in pos3 or 4, we could try a word that puts P in pos3, but I couldn't find a common one. Like ""CRUPT"" but no E. Not fitting.

So ""TRIPE"" is a solid choice.

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)  
  - Confirms: R is in position 2 and E is in position 5. Eliminates C, A, N.
- **Guess 2: prose** → P(-), R(✓), O(x), S(x), E(✓)  
  - Confirms: P is present but not in position 1. Eliminates O and S. The (-) for P indicates it must be in position 3 or 4 of the secret word.

**Current knowledge:**
- Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`
- Present letters: R (pos2), E (pos5), P (either pos3 or 4)
- Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
- Untried common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, T, U, etc.

**Strategy for next guess:**
- Rule out positions for P while testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., T and I).
- Since P must be in position 3 or 4, **tripe** is a valid guess:
  - P is placed in position 4 to test if it belongs there.
  - T is tested in position 1 (untried, common).
  - I is tested in position 3 (untried vowel).
- This guess efficiently narrows possibilities:
  - If P gets ""✓"", it confirms position 4; if ""-"", P must be in position 3.
  - Feedback on T and I reveals if they are present and their positions.

<guess>tripe</guess>",tripe,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- So we know:
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
  - C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
And it does not contain C, A, or N.

Guess 2: ""prose"" -> P(-), R(✓), O(x), S(x), E(✓)
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be either in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: the feedback says P(-), meaning P is present but not in position 1. Since we guessed P in position 1 and it's marked as (-), that means P is in the word but not at position 1. Also, since the pattern has positions 3 and 4 unknown, P could be in position 3 or 4 of the secret word.
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is not in the word (x).

Add to the exclusions: O and S are not in the word.

So now, we know:
- The word pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, A, N, O, S
- Present letters: R (pos2), E (pos5), and P (somewhere, but not pos1). Also from ""crane"", R and E are present.

So the word must contain P, and it is in position 3 or 4 (since pos2 is R and pos5 is E, and pos1 is not P as per feedback).

Therefore, possible positions for P: 3 or 4.

We also have to find the first letter and the remaining middle letter.

Now, we know the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, O, S

And the known present letters: R, E, P. But E and R positions are fixed, so P is additional and must be placed.

Now, what letters have we not tried? From the common ones, we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, P, O, S.

So untried common letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, T, U, W, etc.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Does not use C, A, N, O, S
- Must include P if we haven't confirmed its position? Actually, no, the guess doesn't have to include P because we can use other letters to test. But since P is in the word, we should try to use it? Not necessarily. We can make a guess that helps find the first letter and the other middle letter without P, to narrow down possibilities.

But let's think about possible words that fit the pattern and satisfy the constraints.

The word must be: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

And must contain P, which must be either letter3 or letter4.

So possible:

- If P is letter3: then pattern: _ R P _ E
- If P is letter4: then pattern: _ R _ P E

Also, letter1 must be one of the not-excluded letters, and similarly for the remaining letter.

But we don't know which one.

Also, in the guess, we can try a word that tests one of these cases and also tests other possible letters.

For example, we could try a word where P is in position 3 or 4, and also uses new letters for the other positions.

Case 1: Assume P is in position 3. Then the word is _ R P _ E.

What could be the first and fourth letters? First letter not excluded, fourth letter not excluded.

Possible words: 
- GRIPE? But G is not excluded. GRIPE would be G R I P E -> but we have to avoid O,S,A,C,N? Yes.
- But what about feedback? We will get clues.

Case 2: Assume P is in position 4. Then _ R _ P E.

Possible words: CRUMP? But C is excluded. Or TRUMP? T R U M P -> but the fifth letter is P? We need fifth to be E. Pattern is E at end. So TRUMP doesn't end with E. So not.

The word must end with E.

So for _ R _ P E: the third letter is a letter, then P and E.

But there are not many words ending with ""PE"".

For example: GRAPE? But A is excluded. GRIPE is not ending with PE, GRIPE ends with E but the P is third? GRIPE: G R I P E -> so letter4 is P? Yes, positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E.

So GRIPE has pattern _ R _ _ E with P at position 4.

Similarly, for P at position 3: TRIPE? T R I P E -> P at position 4 again? Positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:E -> so P is at position 4? Not position 3.

To have P at position 3: we need a word like _ R P?E. For example: ""RAPSE"" but R is not first, and A excluded. Not many common words.

Perhaps ""AMPLE"" but A excluded, and P is position 2? Not.

For P in position 3: example words? 
- RIPED? But not a word, usually ""riped"" is not common. 
- ""CRIMP"" but C excluded and no E. 
- ""TRIBE"" but P not there. 

Actually, let's find words with pattern _ R P _ E. It might be rare.

More common: words with P in position 4: like GRIPE, TRIPE, STRIPE (but S excluded), TRIPE is T R I P E.

Also: DRIPE? Not a word.

So common one: GRIPE, TRIPE.

But TRIPE has T, R, I, P, E.

Similarly, GRIPE has G, R, I, P, E.

Now, we also could have P in position 1? But feedback from ""prose"" said P(-) meaning P is not position 1 and also not correct position, so it could be position 3 or 4. Position 1 is not allowed since we guessed it in position 1 and it's wrong.

In fact, the feedback P(-) indicates that P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, let's see what other words fit the pattern without including O,S,A,C,N.

For the guess, we could try ""gripe"" or ""tripe"" to test one of these possibilities.

But note: if we try ""gripe"", we will test:
- G as first letter (new)
- R fixed ✓
- I as third letter (new)
- P as fourth letter (we know P is in the word, so this might be correct position or not? We don't know if it's position 3 or 4 yet.)

Similarly, ""tripe"" would test T and I.

But we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Another idea: since P is present, we can try to guess a word that puts P in position 4, and tests a different third letter and first letter.

For example, ""gripe"" tests G and I.

""tripe"" tests T and I.

But I is common, so we might get clues on I.

We could try a word that uses a different vowel, like U.

For example, BRUTE? But we don't have P. And O is out, but U is in? But we need to include P? No, not necessary for the guess to include P, as we are allowed to make any guess.

But since P is confirmed in the word, if we don't include P, then we must be careful not to waste positions.

But we know P is present, so by including P, we can try to pin down its position.

But let's think of the options.

Option 1: Guess a word that puts P in position 4 and tests I in position 3 and a new first letter. Words: gripe, tripe.

Option 2: Guess a word that puts P in position 3, but as we saw, it's harder. For example: ""ripen"" but R is fixed at position 2? And N excluded, and E fixed at end. ""RIPEN"" is R I P E N -> not E at end? Ends with N. And pattern must have R at pos2 and E at pos5, so RIPEN is R at 1? Not.

Actually, ""URPOSE"" not 5 letters.

So perhaps P in position 3 is not common. After some thought, it's more likely P is in position 4.

So let's assume P is in position 4 for now, so the word is _ R _ P E.

Then the missing letters are first position and third position.

The third position could be a vowel or consonant, and first is any letter not excluded.

We have eliminated O, S, A, C, N.

Possible vowels for third position: E is used at end, so probably not, and A is out, O out, so I or U are likely.

Consonants possible.

In the guess, we can choose a word that tests possible candidates for first and third.

For example, if we pick ""tripe"", we test T for first and I for third.

But we don't know if T is present or not.

We could try ""prime"": P R I M E -> but pattern: P at pos1, but we know P cannot be pos1 because from feedback P(-) in position 1. And also the word would start with P, but we need _ R? So ""prime"" has R in position 2? Yes: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But M at pos4? We are testing P at position 1? But we know P is not pos1, so if we guess ""prime"", we would be putting P in position 1 again, which we know is wrong. So it might be inefficient.

Moreover, having P in pos1 would likely get (-) or (x), but we know P is present so (-) if not other positions.

But we already know P is not pos1, so it's better to avoid that.

Therefore, we should avoid putting P in position 1.

Similarly, in positions 2 and 5 we have fixed R and E.

So best to put P in either position 3 or 4 in our guess to try to get its correct position.

Since one of these is likely to be correct.

For the guess, let's try putting P in position 4, and pick a new letter for position 1 and position 3.

For example, use ""TRIPE"": 
- T for first position (test if T is in word and correct position or not)
- R fixed
- I for third position (test if I is in word and if at third or elsewhere)
- P for fourth position (we know P is present, so if we get ✓, then position 4 is correct; if (-), then P is at position 3; if x, impossible since P is present)
- Then E fixed.

In this guess, we can have outcomes:
- If the I at third position is correct, we get ✓ for I.
- Similarly for T and P.

Another candidate: ""PRUDE""? P at first? But P cannot be first.

""DRIVE"" but no P, and we want to include P? Not necessary.

But to be efficient, let's choose ""TRIPE"".

But note, we have not tried T and I before.

For example, if we guess ""TRIBE"", the word is _ R _ _ E with T in first, I in third, B in fourth, E fifth.

Feedback:
- T: if present and correct position or not.
- R: ✓, of course.
- I: present or not, and position.
