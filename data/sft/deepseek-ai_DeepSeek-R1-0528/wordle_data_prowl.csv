We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically includes common letters and is composed of letters that are frequently used in five-letter words.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good.

 However, note that the game rules allow any valid five-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers multiple common letters.

 Let me check: S, L, A, T, E.

 Therefore, my first guess is: SLATE
</think>
For the first guess with no prior information, I'm selecting a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters frequently appear in English 5-letter words, helping to narrow down possibilities quickly.

We've received feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not present in the secret word at all.

Since A and E are vowels, and they're not in the word, we might need to consider other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, we know the word does not contain C or N.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R in the second position (since we know it's correct).
2. Avoid using C, A, N, E.
3. Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about common letters: vowels I, O, U; consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Since the first position had C (which is wrong), and vowels A and E are out, let's try a word that starts with a consonant and has the second letter R.

Possible starting letters: We avoid C. Common starters: B, S, T, P, D, etc.

Consider a word like ""TRIED"", but ""E"" is not in the word and we know E is out, so avoid E.

The word must have R in the second position and no C, A, N, E.

Example words:
- ""PRISM"": P, R (fixed), I, S, M -> checks if I, S, M are present, and P in first position.
- ""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> similar idea.

But we don't know what other letters might be present.

Another idea: We have only one yellow ✓ for R and four x's. So we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

We should avoid vowels A and E, so try O, I, U.

A good word might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not common. How about ""SPORT""?

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? Wait, we need R in the second.

So let's think of words with R in second position:

Structure: _ R _ _ _

Words: TRYST, PROUD, GROUP, CROWD (but C is out), BROWN, GROWN, DROWN, FROWN, PROWL, GROWL, etc.

We need to avoid C, A, N, E. Also, since we are guessing, let's pick a word with common letters.

From the list:
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is out (we know from first guess N is not in the word). So invalid because uses N.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> letters: G, O, U, P. But what about the first position? G is a new consonant.
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> P, O, W, L.

Another idea: ""TROUT"" — T, R, O, U, T. But T is repeated.

We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but S in first, R in third? Doesn't have R in second.

We need R in second. So:

Try: B R I L L — ""BRILL"" is too short? Five letters: B-R-I-L-L? But double L. Valid word: BRILL is an accepted word? Actually, it's less common.

Better: ""PRIMO"" — P, R, I, M, O.

But let's list common words:

- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> repeated D. Avoid for now.
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> letters F, U, I, T.
- ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> but we know N is out! Cannot use PRINT because of N.
- ""GRIPT"": not a common word.

Another: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> but R is third letter? We need R second.

So: Words with R second: 
- After B: BRIAR (but has A, which is out), BRIEF (has E), BRINE (has N and E), BRICK (C out), etc. Avoid A, E, N, C.
- After D: DRESS (has E), DRILL, DRONE (E), DRIFT (but then I, F, T).
- DRIFT: D, R, I, F, T — letters: D, I, F, T. And avoids forbidden letters.

But is DRIFT common? It's valid.

After F: FRITZ (not common), FROTH, FROST (S, T), FROST: F, R, O, S, T -> but O is vowel. FROST is a good word.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T. Letters: F, O, S, T. O is a vowel we haven't tried.

After G: GRIST, GROSS, GROUT, GROUP. GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — good letters.

After H: HORDE (has E), HARRY (has A), HURRY (U, R, R, Y). Repeating R might not be good because we already know R is in, but for position it might be okay. But let's avoid repeats.

After P: PRICE (has C, out), PRIDE (E), PROSE (E), PROUD? PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — letters P, O, U, D.

After S: SHIRT (but has H, I, T), SHIRE (E), SKIRT (K, I, T), SPORT (S, P, O, R, T — R is fourth? Wrong).

We need R second: So S cannot be first if R is second? Wait, no: the positions are independent.

For example: S R _ _ _ words? Like ""SORRY""? S, O, R, R, Y — has R in third and fourth too? Not ideal.

Actually, ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D — but E is out.

""STRAW"": S, T, R, A, W — A is out.

So perhaps FROST or GROUP or PROUD.

Let's compare:

- FROST: letters F, R, O, S, T. R second. Avoids C,A,N,E.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P. R second.
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D.

All are valid.

Since we have positions to test, we can choose one that covers vowels and consonants we haven't seen.

In FROST: we test F, O, S, T. And O is a vowel.
In GROUP: G, O, U, P. O and U vowels.
In PROUD: P, O, U, D.

Similar.

But FROST has S and T which are common. Also O.

Another word: ""TIMBR"" — not a word. 

What about ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H. That works: B, R, U, S, H. Avoids forbidden letters.

Letters: B, U, S, H.

So options: FROST, GROUP, PROUD, BRUSH.

I think BRUSH and FROST are both solid.

But note: in the first guess, we tried C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding A,E,N,C.

We haven't tried S or T, so including them might be good.

So FROST: S and T are included.

BRUSH has S too.

But BRUSH has U (vowel) and B, H.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T — let's note F is less common.

GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — G and U.

PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — P, U, D.

Perhaps S is common, so choose one with S.

Another word with S: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M. But R is second? In PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, so R is second. Yes.

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M — letters P, I, S, M. Avoids C,A,N,E, and introduces I (vowel), S, M.

I like this because we haven't tried I.

PRISM is a common word.

Other words: TRISM? No.

So between FROST and PRISM.

In PRISM, we have I and S, which are common.

In FROST, O and S,T.

But O is more common than I? Actually, both are common.

But perhaps PRISM is better because it has no repeated letters and covers more.

But let's think: we know R is in the second position for sure. So in PRISM, R is second, which matches.

Similarly for FROST.

I'll choose ""PRISM"" to test I and S.

So second guess: PRISM

Structure: P R I S M

Feedback will tell us:
- If P is in the word? (and position)
- I and S: are they in the word?
- M: present?

And since we know R is correct and second, we focus on others.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep R in the second position.
- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on vowels like I, O, U and consonants like S, T, L, B, etc.

I considered words like ""FROST"" (which tests F, O, S, T), ""GROUP"" (tests G, O, U, P), and ""BRUSH"" (tests B, U, S, H). After evaluating, I chose ""PRISM"" because:
- It has R in the second position, as confirmed.
- It uses letters P, I, S, M (all new and not excluded), providing broad coverage:
  - P and M test common consonants.
  - I tests another vowel.
  - S is a high-frequency consonant.
  - This word avoids repeats and excluded letters.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>prism</guess>",prism,"We've received feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not present in the secret word at all.

Since A and E are vowels, and they're not in the word, we might need to consider other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, we know the word does not contain C or N.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:

2. Avoid using C, A, N, E.
3. Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about common letters: vowels I, O, U; consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Since the first position had C (which is wrong), and vowels A and E are out, let's try a word that starts with a consonant and has the second letter R.

Possible starting letters: We avoid C. Common starters: B, S, T, P, D, etc.

Consider a word like ""TRIED"", but ""E"" is not in the word and we know E is out, so avoid E.

The word must have R in the second position and no C, A, N, E.

Example words:
- ""PRISM"": P, R (fixed), I, S, M -> checks if I, S, M are present, and P in first position.
- ""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> similar idea.

But we don't know what other letters might be present.

Another idea: We have only one yellow ✓ for R and four x's. So we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

We should avoid vowels A and E, so try O, I, U.

A good word might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not common. How about ""SPORT""?

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? Wait, we need R in the second.

So let's think of words with R in second position:

Structure: _ R _ _ _

Words: TRYST, PROUD, GROUP, CROWD (but C is out), BROWN, GROWN, DROWN, FROWN, PROWL, GROWL, etc.

We need to avoid C, A, N, E. Also, since we are guessing, let's pick a word with common letters.

From the list:
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is out (we know from first guess N is not in the word). So invalid because uses N.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> letters: G, O, U, P. But what about the first position? G is a new consonant.
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> P, O, W, L.

Another idea: ""TROUT"" — T, R, O, U, T. But T is repeated.

We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but S in first, R in third? Doesn't have R in second.

We need R in second. So:

Try: B R I L L — ""BRILL"" is too short? Five letters: B-R-I-L-L? But double L. Valid word: BRILL is an accepted word? Actually, it's less common.

Better: ""PRIMO"" — P, R, I, M, O.

But let's list common words:

- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> repeated D. Avoid for now.
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> letters F, U, I, T.
- ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> but we know N is out! Cannot use PRINT because of N.
- ""GRIPT"": not a common word.

Another: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> but R is third letter? We need R second.

So: Words with R second: 
- After B: BRIAR (but has A, which is out), BRIEF (has E), BRINE (has N and E), BRICK (C out), etc. Avoid A, E, N, C.
- After D: DRESS (has E), DRILL, DRONE (E), DRIFT (but then I, F, T).
- DRIFT: D, R, I, F, T — letters: D, I, F, T. And avoids forbidden letters.

But is DRIFT common? It's valid.

After F: FRITZ (not common), FROTH, FROST (S, T), FROST: F, R, O, S, T -> but O is vowel. FROST is a good word.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T. Letters: F, O, S, T. O is a vowel we haven't tried.

After G: GRIST, GROSS, GROUT, GROUP. GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — good letters.

After H: HORDE (has E), HARRY (has A), HURRY (U, R, R, Y). Repeating R might not be good because we already know R is in, but for position it might be okay. But let's avoid repeats.

After P: PRICE (has C, out), PRIDE (E), PROSE (E), PROUD? PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — letters P, O, U, D.

After S: SHIRT (but has H, I, T), SHIRE (E), SKIRT (K, I, T), SPORT (S, P, O, R, T — R is fourth? Wrong).

We need R second: So S cannot be first if R is second? Wait, no: the positions are independent.

For example: S R _ _ _ words? Like ""SORRY""? S, O, R, R, Y — has R in third and fourth too? Not ideal.

Actually, ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D — but E is out.

""STRAW"": S, T, R, A, W — A is out.

So perhaps FROST or GROUP or PROUD.

Let's compare:

- FROST: letters F, R, O, S, T. R second. Avoids C,A,N,E.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P. R second.
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D.

All are valid.

Since we have positions to test, we can choose one that covers vowels and consonants we haven't seen.

In FROST: we test F, O, S, T. And O is a vowel.
In GROUP: G, O, U, P. O and U vowels.
In PROUD: P, O, U, D.

Similar.

But FROST has S and T which are common. Also O.

Another word: ""TIMBR"" — not a word. 

What about ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H. That works: B, R, U, S, H. Avoids forbidden letters.

Letters: B, U, S, H.

So options: FROST, GROUP, PROUD, BRUSH.

I think BRUSH and FROST are both solid.

But note: in the first guess, we tried C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding A,E,N,C.

We haven't tried S or T, so including them might be good.

So FROST: S and T are included.

BRUSH has S too.

But BRUSH has U (vowel) and B, H.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T — let's note F is less common.

GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — G and U.

PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — P, U, D.

Perhaps S is common, so choose one with S.

Another word with S: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M. But R is second? In PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, so R is second. Yes.

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M — letters P, I, S, M. Avoids C,A,N,E, and introduces I (vowel), S, M.

I like this because we haven't tried I.

PRISM is a common word.

Other words: TRISM? No.

So between FROST and PRISM.

In PRISM, we have I and S, which are common.

But O is more common than I? Actually, both are common.

But perhaps PRISM is better because it has no repeated letters and covers more.

But let's think: we know R is in the second position for sure. So in PRISM, R is second, which matches.

Similarly for FROST.

I'll choose ""PRISM"" to test I and S.

So second guess: PRISM

Feedback will tell us:

- I and S: are they in the word?
- M: present?

And since we know R is correct and second, we focus on others.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically includes common letters and is composed of letters that are frequently used in five-letter words.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good.

 However, note that the game rules allow any valid five-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers multiple common letters.

 Let me check: S, L, A, T, E.

 Therefore, my first guess is: SLATEFor the first guess with no prior information, I'm selecting a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters frequently appear in English 5-letter words, helping to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We've received feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not present in the secret word at all.

Since A and E are vowels, and they're not in the word, we might need to consider other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, we know the word does not contain C or N.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R in the second position (since we know it's correct).
2. Avoid using C, A, N, E.
3. Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about common letters: vowels I, O, U; consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Since the first position had C (which is wrong), and vowels A and E are out, let's try a word that starts with a consonant and has the second letter R.

Possible starting letters: We avoid C. Common starters: B, S, T, P, D, etc.

Consider a word like ""TRIED"", but ""E"" is not in the word and we know E is out, so avoid E.

The word must have R in the second position and no C, A, N, E.

Example words:
- ""PRISM"": P, R (fixed), I, S, M -> checks if I, S, M are present, and P in first position.
- ""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> similar idea.

But we don't know what other letters might be present.

Another idea: We have only one yellow ✓ for R and four x's. So we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

We should avoid vowels A and E, so try O, I, U.

A good word might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not common. How about ""SPORT""?

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? Wait, we need R in the second.

So let's think of words with R in second position:

Structure: _ R _ _ _

Words: TRYST, PROUD, GROUP, CROWD (but C is out), BROWN, GROWN, DROWN, FROWN, PROWL, GROWL, etc.

We need to avoid C, A, N, E. Also, since we are guessing, let's pick a word with common letters.

From the list:
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is out (we know from first guess N is not in the word). So invalid because uses N.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> letters: G, O, U, P. But what about the first position? G is a new consonant.
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> P, O, W, L.

Another idea: ""TROUT"" — T, R, O, U, T. But T is repeated.

We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but S in first, R in third? Doesn't have R in second.

We need R in second. So:

Try: B R I L L — ""BRILL"" is too short? Five letters: B-R-I-L-L? But double L. Valid word: BRILL is an accepted word? Actually, it's less common.

Better: ""PRIMO"" — P, R, I, M, O.

But let's list common words:

- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> repeated D. Avoid for now.
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> letters F, U, I, T.
- ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> but we know N is out! Cannot use PRINT because of N.
- ""GRIPT"": not a common word.

Another: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> but R is third letter? We need R second.

So: Words with R second: 
- After B: BRIAR (but has A, which is out), BRIEF (has E), BRINE (has N and E), BRICK (C out), etc. Avoid A, E, N, C.
- After D: DRESS (has E), DRILL, DRONE (E), DRIFT (but then I, F, T).
- DRIFT: D, R, I, F, T — letters: D, I, F, T. And avoids forbidden letters.

But is DRIFT common? It's valid.

After F: FRITZ (not common), FROTH, FROST (S, T), FROST: F, R, O, S, T -> but O is vowel. FROST is a good word.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T. Letters: F, O, S, T. O is a vowel we haven't tried.

After G: GRIST, GROSS, GROUT, GROUP. GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — good letters.

After H: HORDE (has E), HARRY (has A), HURRY (U, R, R, Y). Repeating R might not be good because we already know R is in, but for position it might be okay. But let's avoid repeats.

After P: PRICE (has C, out), PRIDE (E), PROSE (E), PROUD? PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — letters P, O, U, D.

After S: SHIRT (but has H, I, T), SHIRE (E), SKIRT (K, I, T), SPORT (S, P, O, R, T — R is fourth? Wrong).

We need R second: So S cannot be first if R is second? Wait, no: the positions are independent.

For example: S R _ _ _ words? Like ""SORRY""? S, O, R, R, Y — has R in third and fourth too? Not ideal.

Actually, ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D — but E is out.

""STRAW"": S, T, R, A, W — A is out.

So perhaps FROST or GROUP or PROUD.

Let's compare:

- FROST: letters F, R, O, S, T. R second. Avoids C,A,N,E.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P. R second.
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D.

All are valid.

Since we have positions to test, we can choose one that covers vowels and consonants we haven't seen.

In FROST: we test F, O, S, T. And O is a vowel.
In GROUP: G, O, U, P. O and U vowels.
In PROUD: P, O, U, D.

Similar.

But FROST has S and T which are common. Also O.

Another word: ""TIMBR"" — not a word. 

What about ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H. That works: B, R, U, S, H. Avoids forbidden letters.

Letters: B, U, S, H.

So options: FROST, GROUP, PROUD, BRUSH.

I think BRUSH and FROST are both solid.

But note: in the first guess, we tried C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding A,E,N,C.

We haven't tried S or T, so including them might be good.

So FROST: S and T are included.

BRUSH has S too.

But BRUSH has U (vowel) and B, H.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T — let's note F is less common.

GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — G and U.

PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — P, U, D.

Perhaps S is common, so choose one with S.

Another word with S: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M. But R is second? In PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, so R is second. Yes.

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M — letters P, I, S, M. Avoids C,A,N,E, and introduces I (vowel), S, M.

I like this because we haven't tried I.

PRISM is a common word.

Other words: TRISM? No.

So between FROST and PRISM.

In PRISM, we have I and S, which are common.

In FROST, O and S,T.

But O is more common than I? Actually, both are common.

But perhaps PRISM is better because it has no repeated letters and covers more.

But let's think: we know R is in the second position for sure. So in PRISM, R is second, which matches.

Similarly for FROST.

I'll choose ""PRISM"" to test I and S.

So second guess: PRISM

Structure: P R I S M

Feedback will tell us:
- If P is in the word? (and position)
- I and S: are they in the word?
- M: present?

And since we know R is correct and second, we focus on others.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep R in the second position.
- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on vowels like I, O, U and consonants like S, T, L, B, etc.

I considered words like ""FROST"" (which tests F, O, S, T), ""GROUP"" (tests G, O, U, P), and ""BRUSH"" (tests B, U, S, H). After evaluating, I chose ""PRISM"" because:
- It has R in the second position, as confirmed.
- It uses letters P, I, S, M (all new and not excluded), providing broad coverage:
  - P and M test common consonants.
  - I tests another vowel.
  - S is a high-frequency consonant.
  - This word avoids repeats and excluded letters.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: PRISM
- P: correct position (first letter) (✓)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- M: not in word (x)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is P (since P is correct in position 1).
2. The second letter is R (correct in position 2).
3. The following letters are not in the word at all: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Also, since we have two correct positions (first and second), the word starts with ""PR"".

Now, the secret word is of the form: P R _ _ _

We need to find the remaining three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

We must avoid using these.

We have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for a common English word.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, I, N, S, M.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions.

We have positions 3, 4, and 5 to fill.

Common letters that might appear: O, T, L, D, U, etc.

We should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Let's think of words that start with ""PR"" and do not contain the excluded letters.

For example:

- PROUD: but we have excluded letters? P, R, O, U, D. O and U are not excluded, D is not excluded. But we don't know if O or U are in the word. However, in our guess, we can use it to test.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, E, I, N, S, M. PROUD has none of these, so it's okay.

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: PROWL: P, R, O, W, L.

Or PROXY: but X and Y are less common.

But let's list possible words:

- PROWL
- PROUD
- PROOF: but O is repeated? And F is a letter.
- PROBE: but E is excluded (from first guess, E is not in word) so invalid for guess because E is out.
- PRONG: N is excluded, so no.
- PRANK: A and N excluded.
- PRICE: C and E excluded.

So, without excluded letters, we have:

- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PROXY (P,R,O,X,Y) - but might be less common
- PROSY: S excluded.
- PROLE: E excluded.
- PROSS: S excluded.
- PROST: S excluded.
- PROEM: E excluded.

Also, what about ""PRY""? Too short.

Or ""PRUNE"": U, N, E - N and E excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are good candidates.

But we also have other possibilities: what about ""PRIVY""? But I and V? I is excluded, so no.

""PRIMP"": M excluded.

So, let's consider PROUD and PROWL.

In PROUD, we test O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL, we test O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.

We could also consider ""PROOF"", but it has double O, which might not be ideal for information, but it's valid.

PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. So it tests O and F, but O repeated.

Similarly, ""PROLL"" is not a word.

Another word: ""PROBS"" - not common, and S excluded.

""PROKE"" - E excluded.

""PROGS"" - S excluded.

""PROIN"" - I and N excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are among the best.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, etc.

We could also consider ""PRUTA"" - but A excluded.

Or ""PRUNT"" - N excluded.

So, let's choose between PROUD and PROWL.

We might also think of ""PRONG"" but N is excluded.

Another one: ""PROSO"" - S excluded.

Perhaps ""PROTO"" - T and O. P,R,O,T,O? Not five letters? PROTO is a prefix, but as a word? Not common.

""PROTO"" is not typically a standalone word.

""PRATT"" - A excluded.

""PREST"" - E and S excluded.

So, I think PROUD or PROWL.

But let's see if there is a word with T, since T is common.

For example, ""PRINT"" - I and N excluded.

""PARTY"" - A excluded.

""PORTY"" - not common.

""PRAT"" too short.

""PRUTA"" A excluded.

""PRWET"" not a word.

So, perhaps PROUD is a good choice.

But we have to make a guess that can give us information.

Since we know the first two letters, and we have many letters excluded, we might be able to guess the word.

Possible words starting with PR, without A,C,E,I,N,S,M:

- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PROLE (but E excluded, so no)
- PROSY (S excluded)
- PROEM (E excluded)
- PROKE (E excluded)
- PROSO (S excluded)
- PROSS (S excluded)
- PROST (S excluded)
- PROLL (not a word)
- PROBS (S excluded)
- PROGS (S excluded)
- PROIN (I and N excluded)
- PRUDE: U, D, E - E excluded, so no.
- PRUNE: U, N, E - excluded.
- PRATE: A, T, E - A and E excluded.

So, only a few options: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY.

PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y. X and Y are less common, so PROUD and PROWL are more likely.

But let's check if there are others.

What about ""PROOF""? P,R,O,O,F. It has double O, but it's a valid word. And F is a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""PROFS"" - S excluded.

""PROMO"" - M and O? M is excluded, so no.

""PROUL"" - not a word.

""PROUL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""PRYER"" - but E and R? R is already known, and E excluded.

""PRYSE"" - S and E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are PROUD, PROWL, and PROOF.

Now, for information:

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PROOF: tests O (twice) and F

Since O is tested in all, and we don't know if it's in the word, we can choose one.

But PROOF has a repeated letter, which might give less information if O is not present, but if O is present, we get position information.

But to maximize new letters, PROUD or PROWL is better.

Let's choose PROUD because U and D are common.

But we have to consider that the word might be PROWL or something else.

Another possibility: ""PRICK"" - I and C excluded.

No.

""PRINK"" - I and N excluded.

So, I think we should guess PROUD.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess PROUD:

- P: already correct (we know, so it will be ✓)
- R: already correct (✓)
- O: if O is in the word and in position 3, it will be ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x
- U: similarly
- D: similarly

But since we know P and R are fixed, we only care about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we might get lucky and guess the word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have O, in case O is not in the word.

For example, are there words starting with PR without O and without excluded letters?

For instance:

- PRUTA: A excluded.
- PRUNT: N excluded.
- PRY: too short.
- PRYED: E excluded.
- PRYER: E excluded.
- PRYSE: S and E excluded.
- PRYDE: E excluded.

What about ""PREDY""? E excluded.

""PREXY"": E excluded.

""PRIMY"": I excluded.

""PRISS"": I and S excluded.

""PRINK"": I and N excluded.

""PRIGS"": I and S excluded.

""PRICK"": I and C excluded.

""PRIDE"": I and E excluded.

""PRIED"": I and E excluded.

""PRESS"": E and S excluded.

""PRATS"": A and S excluded.

""PRATT"": A excluded.

""PRAWN"": A excluded.

""PRAD"": too short.

""PRAT"": too short.

""PRED"": too short.

""PREF"": too short.

""PREP"": E excluded.

""PREX"": E excluded.

""PRIG"": I? But we have I excluded, so no.

""PRIT"": not common.

""PRO"": too short.

""PRY"": too short.

So, it seems that with the exclusions, the only common words are those with O in the third position, like PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PROOF.

PROOF is P,R,O,O,F.

But F is possible.

Another word: ""PROUL"" not word.

""PROKE"" E excluded.

So, I think we have to go with one of these.

Perhaps ""PROBE"" but E excluded.

No.

So, let's choose PROUD as it is a common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""PROUD"".

But note: in the feedback, for PROUD, we know P and R will be correct, so we only need to see the feedback for O, U, D.

If the word is PROUD, we win.

If not, we get information about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third.

We could also consider testing more letters.

For example, instead of guessing a possible word, we could guess a word that tests different letters in the positions.

But since we have two fixed, and three unknown, and many letters excluded, it might be better to guess a possible word.

For instance, we could guess ""PLUMB"" but that doesn't start with PR? We know it starts with PR, so we must have P and R fixed.

So, the guess must start with PR.

Therefore, we are limited.

Another idea: guess a word like ""PRW..."" but no, not a word.

So, I think PROUD is a good choice.

Let's go with PROUD.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (not in word). This confirms:
  - The second letter is R.
  - C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (PRISM)**: P (correct position), R (correct position), I (not in word), S (not in word), M (not in word). This confirms:
  - The first letter is P.
  - The second letter is R (already known).
  - I, S, and M are absent from the secret word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, I, M, N, S.
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word is of the form: P R _ _ _.
- Common words fitting this pattern (without excluded letters) include PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, and PROOF. However, PROXY (with X and Y) is less common, and PROOF has a repeated O, which may reduce information gain if O is incorrect.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since only positions 3–5 are unknown, I'll prioritize guessing a valid word that tests new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- ""PROUD"" is chosen because:
  - It tests O (position 3), U (position 4), and D (position 5)—all common letters not yet tried.
  - It avoids all excluded letters (A, C, E, I, M, N, S).
  - If correct, it wins the game. If not, the feedback on O, U, and D will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., to words like PROWL or PROOF).

<guess>proud</guess>",proud,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: PRISM
- P: correct position (first letter) (✓)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- M: not in word (x)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is P (since P is correct in position 1).
2. The second letter is R (correct in position 2).
3. The following letters are not in the word at all: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Also, since we have two correct positions (first and second), the word starts with ""PR"".

Now, the secret word is of the form: P R _ _ _

We need to find the remaining three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

We must avoid using these.

We have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for a common English word.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, I, N, S, M.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions.

We have positions 3, 4, and 5 to fill.

Common letters that might appear: O, T, L, D, U, etc.

We should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Let's think of words that start with ""PR"" and do not contain the excluded letters.

For example:

- PROUD: but we have excluded letters? P, R, O, U, D. O and U are not excluded, D is not excluded. But we don't know if O or U are in the word. However, in our guess, we can use it to test.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, E, I, N, S, M. PROUD has none of these, so it's okay.

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: PROWL: P, R, O, W, L.

Or PROXY: but X and Y are less common.

But let's list possible words:

- PROWL
- PROUD
- PROOF: but O is repeated? And F is a letter.
- PROBE: but E is excluded (from first guess, E is not in word) so invalid for guess because E is out.
- PRONG: N is excluded, so no.
- PRANK: A and N excluded.
- PRICE: C and E excluded.

So, without excluded letters, we have:

- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PROXY (P,R,O,X,Y) - but might be less common
- PROSY: S excluded.
- PROLE: E excluded.
- PROSS: S excluded.
- PROST: S excluded.
- PROEM: E excluded.

Also, what about ""PRY""? Too short.

Or ""PRUNE"": U, N, E - N and E excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are good candidates.

But we also have other possibilities: what about ""PRIVY""? But I and V? I is excluded, so no.

""PRIMP"": M excluded.

So, let's consider PROUD and PROWL.

In PROUD, we test O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL, we test O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.

We could also consider ""PROOF"", but it has double O, which might not be ideal for information, but it's valid.

PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. So it tests O and F, but O repeated.

Similarly, ""PROLL"" is not a word.

Another word: ""PROBS"" - not common, and S excluded.

""PROKE"" - E excluded.

""PROGS"" - S excluded.

""PROIN"" - I and N excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are among the best.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, etc.

We could also consider ""PRUTA"" - but A excluded.

Or ""PRUNT"" - N excluded.

So, let's choose between PROUD and PROWL.

We might also think of ""PRONG"" but N is excluded.

Another one: ""PROSO"" - S excluded.

Perhaps ""PROTO"" - T and O. P,R,O,T,O? Not five letters? PROTO is a prefix, but as a word? Not common.

""PROTO"" is not typically a standalone word.

""PRATT"" - A excluded.

""PREST"" - E and S excluded.

So, I think PROUD or PROWL.

But let's see if there is a word with T, since T is common.

For example, ""PRINT"" - I and N excluded.

""PARTY"" - A excluded.

""PORTY"" - not common.

""PRAT"" too short.

""PRUTA"" A excluded.

""PRWET"" not a word.

So, perhaps PROUD is a good choice.

But we have to make a guess that can give us information.

Since we know the first two letters, and we have many letters excluded, we might be able to guess the word.

Possible words starting with PR, without A,C,E,I,N,S,M:

- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PROLE (but E excluded, so no)
- PROSY (S excluded)
- PROEM (E excluded)
- PROKE (E excluded)
- PROSO (S excluded)
- PROSS (S excluded)
- PROST (S excluded)
- PROLL (not a word)
- PROBS (S excluded)
- PROGS (S excluded)
- PROIN (I and N excluded)
- PRUDE: U, D, E - E excluded, so no.
- PRUNE: U, N, E - excluded.
- PRATE: A, T, E - A and E excluded.

So, only a few options: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY.

PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y. X and Y are less common, so PROUD and PROWL are more likely.

But let's check if there are others.

What about ""PROOF""? P,R,O,O,F. It has double O, but it's a valid word. And F is a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""PROFS"" - S excluded.

""PROMO"" - M and O? M is excluded, so no.

""PROUL"" - not a word.

""PROUL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""PRYER"" - but E and R? R is already known, and E excluded.

""PRYSE"" - S and E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are PROUD, PROWL, and PROOF.

Now, for information:

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PROOF: tests O (twice) and F

Since O is tested in all, and we don't know if it's in the word, we can choose one.

But PROOF has a repeated letter, which might give less information if O is not present, but if O is present, we get position information.

But to maximize new letters, PROUD or PROWL is better.

Let's choose PROUD because U and D are common.

But we have to consider that the word might be PROWL or something else.

Another possibility: ""PRICK"" - I and C excluded.

No.

""PRINK"" - I and N excluded.

So, I think we should guess PROUD.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess PROUD:

- P: already correct (we know, so it will be ✓)
- R: already correct (✓)
- O: if O is in the word and in position 3, it will be ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x
- U: similarly
- D: similarly

But since we know P and R are fixed, we only care about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we might get lucky and guess the word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have O, in case O is not in the word.

For example, are there words starting with PR without O and without excluded letters?

For instance:

- PRUTA: A excluded.
- PRUNT: N excluded.
- PRY: too short.
- PRYED: E excluded.
- PRYER: E excluded.
- PRYSE: S and E excluded.
- PRYDE: E excluded.

What about ""PREDY""? E excluded.

""PREXY"": E excluded.

""PRIMY"": I excluded.

""PRISS"": I and S excluded.

""PRINK"": I and N excluded.

""PRIGS"": I and S excluded.

""PRICK"": I and C excluded.

""PRIDE"": I and E excluded.

""PRIED"": I and E excluded.

""PRESS"": E and S excluded.

""PRATS"": A and S excluded.

""PRATT"": A excluded.

""PRAWN"": A excluded.

""PRAD"": too short.

""PRAT"": too short.

""PRED"": too short.

""PREF"": too short.

""PREP"": E excluded.

""PREX"": E excluded.

""PRIG"": I? But we have I excluded, so no.

""PRIT"": not common.

""PRO"": too short.

""PRY"": too short.

So, it seems that with the exclusions, the only common words are those with O in the third position, like PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PROOF.

PROOF is P,R,O,O,F.

But F is possible.

Another word: ""PROUL"" not word.

""PROKE"" E excluded.

So, I think we have to go with one of these.

Perhaps ""PROBE"" but E excluded.

No.

So, let's choose PROUD as it is a common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""PROUD"".

But note: in the feedback, for PROUD, we know P and R will be correct, so we only need to see the feedback for O, U, D.

If the word is PROUD, we win.

If not, we get information about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third.

We could also consider testing more letters.

For example, instead of guessing a possible word, we could guess a word that tests different letters in the positions.

But since we have two fixed, and three unknown, and many letters excluded, it might be better to guess a possible word.

For instance, we could guess ""PLUMB"" but that doesn't start with PR? We know it starts with PR, so we must have P and R fixed.

So, the guess must start with PR.

Therefore, we are limited.

Another idea: guess a word like ""PRW..."" but no, not a word.

So, I think PROUD is a good choice.

Let's go with PROUD.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (not in word). This confirms:
  - The second letter is R.

  - The first letter is P.
  - The second letter is R (already known).

- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, I, M, N, S.
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- Common words fitting this pattern (without excluded letters) include PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, and PROOF. However, PROXY (with X and Y) is less common, and PROOF has a repeated O, which may reduce information gain if O is incorrect.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically includes common letters and is composed of letters that are frequently used in five-letter words.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and some consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).

 One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters: S, L, A, T, E.
 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" are also good.

 However, note that the game rules allow any valid five-letter English word.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers multiple common letters.

 Let me check: S, L, A, T, E.

 Therefore, my first guess is: SLATEFor the first guess with no prior information, I'm selecting a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize feedback. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- These letters frequently appear in English 5-letter words, helping to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We've received feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is R)
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not present in the secret word at all.

Since A and E are vowels, and they're not in the word, we might need to consider other vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

Also, we know the word does not contain C or N.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
1. Include R in the second position (since we know it's correct).
2. Avoid using C, A, N, E.
3. Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about common letters: vowels I, O, U; consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Since the first position had C (which is wrong), and vowels A and E are out, let's try a word that starts with a consonant and has the second letter R.

Possible starting letters: We avoid C. Common starters: B, S, T, P, D, etc.

Consider a word like ""TRIED"", but ""E"" is not in the word and we know E is out, so avoid E.

The word must have R in the second position and no C, A, N, E.

Example words:
- ""PRISM"": P, R (fixed), I, S, M -> checks if I, S, M are present, and P in first position.
- ""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> similar idea.

But we don't know what other letters might be present.

Another idea: We have only one yellow ✓ for R and four x's. So we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, G, H, etc.

We should avoid vowels A and E, so try O, I, U.

A good word might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not common. How about ""SPORT""?

""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? Wait, we need R in the second.

So let's think of words with R in second position:

Structure: _ R _ _ _

Words: TRYST, PROUD, GROUP, CROWD (but C is out), BROWN, GROWN, DROWN, FROWN, PROWL, GROWL, etc.

We need to avoid C, A, N, E. Also, since we are guessing, let's pick a word with common letters.

From the list:
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is out (we know from first guess N is not in the word). So invalid because uses N.
- ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> letters: G, O, U, P. But what about the first position? G is a new consonant.
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> P, O, W, L.

Another idea: ""TROUT"" — T, R, O, U, T. But T is repeated.

We should avoid repeating letters if possible to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> but S in first, R in third? Doesn't have R in second.

We need R in second. So:

Try: B R I L L — ""BRILL"" is too short? Five letters: B-R-I-L-L? But double L. Valid word: BRILL is an accepted word? Actually, it's less common.

Better: ""PRIMO"" — P, R, I, M, O.

But let's list common words:

- ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> repeated D. Avoid for now.
- ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> letters F, U, I, T.
- ""PRINT"": P, R, I, N, T -> but we know N is out! Cannot use PRINT because of N.
- ""GRIPT"": not a common word.

Another: ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> but R is third letter? We need R second.

So: Words with R second: 
- After B: BRIAR (but has A, which is out), BRIEF (has E), BRINE (has N and E), BRICK (C out), etc. Avoid A, E, N, C.
- After D: DRESS (has E), DRILL, DRONE (E), DRIFT (but then I, F, T).
- DRIFT: D, R, I, F, T — letters: D, I, F, T. And avoids forbidden letters.

But is DRIFT common? It's valid.

After F: FRITZ (not common), FROTH, FROST (S, T), FROST: F, R, O, S, T -> but O is vowel. FROST is a good word.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T. Letters: F, O, S, T. O is a vowel we haven't tried.

After G: GRIST, GROSS, GROUT, GROUP. GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — good letters.

After H: HORDE (has E), HARRY (has A), HURRY (U, R, R, Y). Repeating R might not be good because we already know R is in, but for position it might be okay. But let's avoid repeats.

After P: PRICE (has C, out), PRIDE (E), PROSE (E), PROUD? PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — letters P, O, U, D.

After S: SHIRT (but has H, I, T), SHIRE (E), SKIRT (K, I, T), SPORT (S, P, O, R, T — R is fourth? Wrong).

We need R second: So S cannot be first if R is second? Wait, no: the positions are independent.

For example: S R _ _ _ words? Like ""SORRY""? S, O, R, R, Y — has R in third and fourth too? Not ideal.

Actually, ""SHRED"": S, H, R, E, D — but E is out.

""STRAW"": S, T, R, A, W — A is out.

So perhaps FROST or GROUP or PROUD.

Let's compare:

- FROST: letters F, R, O, S, T. R second. Avoids C,A,N,E.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P. R second.
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D.

All are valid.

Since we have positions to test, we can choose one that covers vowels and consonants we haven't seen.

In FROST: we test F, O, S, T. And O is a vowel.
In GROUP: G, O, U, P. O and U vowels.
In PROUD: P, O, U, D.

Similar.

But FROST has S and T which are common. Also O.

Another word: ""TIMBR"" — not a word. 

What about ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H. That works: B, R, U, S, H. Avoids forbidden letters.

Letters: B, U, S, H.

So options: FROST, GROUP, PROUD, BRUSH.

I think BRUSH and FROST are both solid.

But note: in the first guess, we tried C,R,A,N,E. Now we are avoiding A,E,N,C.

We haven't tried S or T, so including them might be good.

So FROST: S and T are included.

BRUSH has S too.

But BRUSH has U (vowel) and B, H.

FROST: F, R, O, S, T — let's note F is less common.

GROUP: G, R, O, U, P — G and U.

PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — P, U, D.

Perhaps S is common, so choose one with S.

Another word with S: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M. But R is second? In PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, so R is second. Yes.

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M — letters P, I, S, M. Avoids C,A,N,E, and introduces I (vowel), S, M.

I like this because we haven't tried I.

PRISM is a common word.

Other words: TRISM? No.

So between FROST and PRISM.

In PRISM, we have I and S, which are common.

In FROST, O and S,T.

But O is more common than I? Actually, both are common.

But perhaps PRISM is better because it has no repeated letters and covers more.

But let's think: we know R is in the second position for sure. So in PRISM, R is second, which matches.

Similarly for FROST.

I'll choose ""PRISM"" to test I and S.

So second guess: PRISM

Structure: P R I S M

Feedback will tell us:
- If P is in the word? (and position)
- I and S: are they in the word?
- M: present?

And since we know R is correct and second, we focus on others.

Therefore, I'll guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep R in the second position.
- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on vowels like I, O, U and consonants like S, T, L, B, etc.

I considered words like ""FROST"" (which tests F, O, S, T), ""GROUP"" (tests G, O, U, P), and ""BRUSH"" (tests B, U, S, H). After evaluating, I chose ""PRISM"" because:
- It has R in the second position, as confirmed.
- It uses letters P, I, S, M (all new and not excluded), providing broad coverage:
  - P and M test common consonants.
  - I tests another vowel.
  - S is a high-frequency consonant.
  - This word avoids repeats and excluded letters.

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>prism</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: PRISM
- P: correct position (first letter) (✓)
- R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
- I: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- M: not in word (x)

So, from this, we know:

1. The first letter is P (since P is correct in position 1).
2. The second letter is R (correct in position 2).
3. The following letters are not in the word at all: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Also, since we have two correct positions (first and second), the word starts with ""PR"".

Now, the secret word is of the form: P R _ _ _

We need to find the remaining three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

We must avoid using these.

We have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for a common English word.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, I, N, S, M.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions.

We have positions 3, 4, and 5 to fill.

Common letters that might appear: O, T, L, D, U, etc.

We should try to cover multiple possibilities.

Let's think of words that start with ""PR"" and do not contain the excluded letters.

For example:

- PROUD: but we have excluded letters? P, R, O, U, D. O and U are not excluded, D is not excluded. But we don't know if O or U are in the word. However, in our guess, we can use it to test.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, E, I, N, S, M. PROUD has none of these, so it's okay.

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: PROWL: P, R, O, W, L.

Or PROXY: but X and Y are less common.

But let's list possible words:

- PROWL
- PROUD
- PROOF: but O is repeated? And F is a letter.
- PROBE: but E is excluded (from first guess, E is not in word) so invalid for guess because E is out.
- PRONG: N is excluded, so no.
- PRANK: A and N excluded.
- PRICE: C and E excluded.

So, without excluded letters, we have:

- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PROXY (P,R,O,X,Y) - but might be less common
- PROSY: S excluded.
- PROLE: E excluded.
- PROSS: S excluded.
- PROST: S excluded.
- PROEM: E excluded.

Also, what about ""PRY""? Too short.

Or ""PRUNE"": U, N, E - N and E excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are good candidates.

But we also have other possibilities: what about ""PRIVY""? But I and V? I is excluded, so no.

""PRIMP"": M excluded.

So, let's consider PROUD and PROWL.

In PROUD, we test O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

In PROWL, we test O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.

We could also consider ""PROOF"", but it has double O, which might not be ideal for information, but it's valid.

PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. So it tests O and F, but O repeated.

Similarly, ""PROLL"" is not a word.

Another word: ""PROBS"" - not common, and S excluded.

""PROKE"" - E excluded.

""PROGS"" - S excluded.

""PROIN"" - I and N excluded.

So, PROUD and PROWL are among the best.

But note: we haven't tested O, U, D, W, L, etc.

We could also consider ""PRUTA"" - but A excluded.

Or ""PRUNT"" - N excluded.

So, let's choose between PROUD and PROWL.

We might also think of ""PRONG"" but N is excluded.

Another one: ""PROSO"" - S excluded.

Perhaps ""PROTO"" - T and O. P,R,O,T,O? Not five letters? PROTO is a prefix, but as a word? Not common.

""PROTO"" is not typically a standalone word.

""PRATT"" - A excluded.

""PREST"" - E and S excluded.

So, I think PROUD or PROWL.

But let's see if there is a word with T, since T is common.

For example, ""PRINT"" - I and N excluded.

""PARTY"" - A excluded.

""PORTY"" - not common.

""PRAT"" too short.

""PRUTA"" A excluded.

""PRWET"" not a word.

So, perhaps PROUD is a good choice.

But we have to make a guess that can give us information.

Since we know the first two letters, and we have many letters excluded, we might be able to guess the word.

Possible words starting with PR, without A,C,E,I,N,S,M:

- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PROLE (but E excluded, so no)
- PROSY (S excluded)
- PROEM (E excluded)
- PROKE (E excluded)
- PROSO (S excluded)
- PROSS (S excluded)
- PROST (S excluded)
- PROLL (not a word)
- PROBS (S excluded)
- PROGS (S excluded)
- PROIN (I and N excluded)
- PRUDE: U, D, E - E excluded, so no.
- PRUNE: U, N, E - excluded.
- PRATE: A, T, E - A and E excluded.

So, only a few options: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY.

PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y. X and Y are less common, so PROUD and PROWL are more likely.

But let's check if there are others.

What about ""PROOF""? P,R,O,O,F. It has double O, but it's a valid word. And F is a letter we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""PROFS"" - S excluded.

""PROMO"" - M and O? M is excluded, so no.

""PROUL"" - not a word.

""PROUL"" is not standard.

Another word: ""PRYER"" - but E and R? R is already known, and E excluded.

""PRYSE"" - S and E excluded.

So, I think the main candidates are PROUD, PROWL, and PROOF.

Now, for information:

- PROUD: tests O, U, D
- PROWL: tests O, W, L
- PROOF: tests O (twice) and F

Since O is tested in all, and we don't know if it's in the word, we can choose one.

But PROOF has a repeated letter, which might give less information if O is not present, but if O is present, we get position information.

But to maximize new letters, PROUD or PROWL is better.

Let's choose PROUD because U and D are common.

But we have to consider that the word might be PROWL or something else.

Another possibility: ""PRICK"" - I and C excluded.

No.

""PRINK"" - I and N excluded.

So, I think we should guess PROUD.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess PROUD:

- P: already correct (we know, so it will be ✓)
- R: already correct (✓)
- O: if O is in the word and in position 3, it will be ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x
- U: similarly
- D: similarly

But since we know P and R are fixed, we only care about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we might get lucky and guess the word.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have O, in case O is not in the word.

For example, are there words starting with PR without O and without excluded letters?

For instance:

- PRUTA: A excluded.
- PRUNT: N excluded.
- PRY: too short.
- PRYED: E excluded.
- PRYER: E excluded.
- PRYSE: S and E excluded.
- PRYDE: E excluded.

What about ""PREDY""? E excluded.

""PREXY"": E excluded.

""PRIMY"": I excluded.

""PRISS"": I and S excluded.

""PRINK"": I and N excluded.

""PRIGS"": I and S excluded.

""PRICK"": I and C excluded.

""PRIDE"": I and E excluded.

""PRIED"": I and E excluded.

""PRESS"": E and S excluded.

""PRATS"": A and S excluded.

""PRATT"": A excluded.

""PRAWN"": A excluded.

""PRAD"": too short.

""PRAT"": too short.

""PRED"": too short.

""PREF"": too short.

""PREP"": E excluded.

""PREX"": E excluded.

""PRIG"": I? But we have I excluded, so no.

""PRIT"": not common.

""PRO"": too short.

""PRY"": too short.

So, it seems that with the exclusions, the only common words are those with O in the third position, like PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PROOF.

PROOF is P,R,O,O,F.

But F is possible.

Another word: ""PROUL"" not word.

""PROKE"" E excluded.

So, I think we have to go with one of these.

Perhaps ""PROBE"" but E excluded.

No.

So, let's choose PROUD as it is a common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""PROUD"".

But note: in the feedback, for PROUD, we know P and R will be correct, so we only need to see the feedback for O, U, D.

If the word is PROUD, we win.

If not, we get information about O, U, D.

Similarly for other guesses.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third.

We could also consider testing more letters.

For example, instead of guessing a possible word, we could guess a word that tests different letters in the positions.

But since we have two fixed, and three unknown, and many letters excluded, it might be better to guess a possible word.

For instance, we could guess ""PLUMB"" but that doesn't start with PR? We know it starts with PR, so we must have P and R fixed.

So, the guess must start with PR.

Therefore, we are limited.

Another idea: guess a word like ""PRW..."" but no, not a word.

So, I think PROUD is a good choice.

Let's go with PROUD.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (not in word). This confirms:
  - The second letter is R.
  - C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (PRISM)**: P (correct position), R (correct position), I (not in word), S (not in word), M (not in word). This confirms:
  - The first letter is P.
  - The second letter is R (already known).
  - I, S, and M are absent from the secret word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, I, M, N, S.
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word is of the form: P R _ _ _.
- Common words fitting this pattern (without excluded letters) include PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, and PROOF. However, PROXY (with X and Y) is less common, and PROOF has a repeated O, which may reduce information gain if O is incorrect.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since only positions 3–5 are unknown, I'll prioritize guessing a valid word that tests new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- ""PROUD"" is chosen because:
  - It tests O (position 3), U (position 4), and D (position 5)—all common letters not yet tried.
  - It avoids all excluded letters (A, C, E, I, M, N, S).
  - If correct, it wins the game. If not, the feedback on O, U, and D will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., to words like PROWL or PROOF).

PROUD: P, R, O, U, D — letters P, O, U, D.\n\nAfter S: SHIRT (but has H, I, T), SHIRE (E), SKIRT (K, I, T), SPORT (S, P, O, R, T — R is fourth? Wrong).\n\nWe need R second: So S cannot be first if R is second? Wait, no: the positions are independent.\n\nFor example: S R _ _ _ words? Like ""SORRY""?

Now we are avoiding A,E,N,C.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S or T, so including them might be good.\n\nSo FROST: S and T are included.\n\nBRUSH has S too.\n\nBut BRUSH has U (vowel) and B, H.\n\nFROST: F, R, O, S, T — let\'s note F is less common.\n\nGROUP: G, R, O, U, P — G and U.\n\nPROUD: P, R, O, U, D — P, U, D.\n\nPerhaps S is common, so choose one with S.\n\nAnother word with S: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M. But R is second? In PRISM: P-R-I-S-M, so R is second. Yes.\n\nPRISM: P, R, I, S, M — letters P, I, S, M. Avoids C,A,N,E, and introduces I (vowel), S, M.\n\nI like this because we haven\'t tried I.\n\nPRISM is a common word.\n\nOther words: TRISM? No.\n\nSo between FROST and PRISM.\n\nIn PRISM, we have I and S, which are common.\n\nIn FROST, O and S,T.\n\nBut O is more common than I? Actually, both are common.\n\nBut perhaps PRISM is better because it has no repeated letters and covers more.\n\nBut let\'s think: we know R is in the second position for sure. So in PRISM, R is second, which matches.\n\nSimilarly for FROST.\n\nI\'ll choose ""PRISM"" to test I and S.\n\nSo second guess: PRISM\n\nStructure: P R I S M\n\nFeedback will tell us:\n- If P is in the word? (and position)\n- I and S: are they in the word?\n- M: present?\n\nAnd since we know R is correct and second, we focus on others.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n- Keep R in the second position.\n- Avoid using any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, E).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information, focusing on vowels like I, O, U and consonants like S, T, L, B, etc.\n\nI considered words like ""FROST"" (which tests F, O, S, T), ""GROUP"" (tests G, O, U, P), and ""BRUSH"" (tests B, U, S, H).

The following letters are not in the word at all: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.\n\nAlso, since we have two correct positions (first and second), the word starts with ""PR"".\n\nNow, the secret word is of the form: P R _ _ _\n\nWe need to find the remaining three letters.\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.\n\nWe must avoid using these.\n\nWe have to consider what letters are still possible. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we are looking for a common English word.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, I, N, S, M.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions.\n\nWe have positions 3, 4, and 5 to fill.\n\nCommon letters that might appear: O, T, L, D, U, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with ""PR"" and do not contain the excluded letters.\n\nFor example:\n\n- PROUD: but we have excluded letters? P, R, O, U, D. O and U are not excluded, D is not excluded. But we don\'t know if O or U are in the word. However, in our guess, we can use it to test.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, C, E, I, N, S, M. PROUD has none of these, so it\'s okay.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAnother word: PROWL: P, R, O, W, L.\n\nOr PROXY: but X and Y are less common.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n- PROWL\n- PROUD\n- PROOF: but O is repeated? And F is a letter.\n- PROBE: but E is excluded (from first guess, E is not in word) so invalid for guess because E is out.\n- PRONG: N is excluded, so no.\n- PRANK: A and N excluded.\n- PRICE: C and E excluded.\n\nSo, without excluded letters, we have:\n\n- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)\n- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)\n- PROXY (P,R,O,X,Y) - but might be less common\n- PROSY: S excluded.\n- PROLE: E excluded.\n- PROSS: S excluded.\n- PROST: S excluded.\n- PROEM: E excluded.\n\nAlso, what about ""PRY""? Too short.\n\nOr ""PRUNE"": U, N, E - N and E excluded.\n\nSo, PROUD and PROWL are good candidates.\n\nBut we also have other possibilities: what about ""PRIVY""? But I and V? I is excluded, so no.\n\n""PRIMP"": M excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s consider PROUD and PROWL.\n\nIn PROUD, we test O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.\n\nIn PROWL, we test O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.\n\nWe could also consider ""PROOF"", but it has double O, which might not be ideal for information, but it\'s valid.\n\nPROOF: P,R,O,O,F. So it tests O and F, but O repeated.\n\nSimilarly, ""PROLL"" is not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""PROBS"" - not common, and S excluded.\n\n""PROKE"" - E excluded.\n\n""PROGS"" - S excluded.\n\n""PROIN"" - I and N excluded.\n\nSo, PROUD and PROWL are among the best.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested O, U, D, W, L, etc.\n\nWe could also consider ""PRUTA"" - but A excluded.\n\nOr ""PRUNT"" - N excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between PROUD and PROWL.\n\nWe might also think of ""PRONG"" but N is excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""PROSO"" - S excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""PROTO"" - T and O. P,R,O,T,O? Not five letters? PROTO is a prefix, but as a word? Not common.\n\n""PROTO"" is not typically a standalone word.\n\n""PRATT"" - A excluded.\n\n""PREST"" - E and S excluded.\n\nSo, I think PROUD or PROWL.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with T, since T is common.\n\nFor example, ""PRINT"" - I and N excluded.\n\n""PARTY"" - A excluded.\n\n""PORTY"" - not common.\n\n""PRAT"" too short.\n\n""PRUTA"" A excluded.\n\n""PRWET"" not a word.\n\nSo, perhaps PROUD is a good choice.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that can give us information.\n\nSince we know the first two letters, and we have many letters excluded, we might be able to guess the word.\n\nPossible words starting with PR, without A,C,E,I,N,S,M:\n\n- PROUD\n- PROWL\n- PROXY\n- PROLE (but E excluded, so no)\n- PROSY (S excluded)\n- PROEM (E excluded)\n- PROKE (E excluded)\n- PROSO (S excluded)\n- PROSS (S excluded)\n- PROST (S excluded)\n- PROLL (not a word)\n- PROBS (S excluded)\n- PROGS (S excluded)\n- PROIN (I and N excluded)\n- PRUDE: U, D, E - E excluded, so no.\n- PRUNE: U, N, E - excluded.\n- PRATE: A, T, E - A and E excluded.\n\nSo, only a few options: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY.\n\nPROXY: P,R,O,X,Y. X and Y are less common, so PROUD and PROWL are more likely.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are others.\n\nWhat about ""PROOF""? P,R,O,O,F. It has double O, but it\'s a valid word. And F is a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly, ""PROFS"" - S excluded.\n\n""PROMO"" - M and O? M is excluded, so no.\n\n""PROUL"" - not a word.\n\n""PROUL"" is not standard.\n\nAnother word: ""PRYER"" - but E and R? R is already known, and E excluded.\n\n""PRYSE"" - S and E excluded.\n\nSo, I think the main candidates are PROUD, PROWL, and PROOF.\n\nNow, for information:\n\n- PROUD: tests O, U, D\n- PROWL: tests O, W, L\n- PROOF: tests O (twice) and F\n\nSince O is tested in all, and we don\'t know if it\'s in the word, we can choose one.\n\nBut PROOF has a repeated letter, which might give less information if O is not present, but if O is present, we get position information.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, PROUD or PROWL is better.\n\nLet\'s choose PROUD because U and D are common.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might be PROWL or something else.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PRICK"" - I and C excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""PRINK"" - I and N excluded.\n\nSo, I think we should guess PROUD.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess PROUD:\n\n- P: already correct (we know, so it will be ✓)\n- R: already correct (✓)\n- O: if O is in the word and in position 3, it will be ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x\n- U: similarly\n- D: similarly\n\nBut since we know P and R are fixed, we only care about O, U, D.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nBut we might get lucky and guess the word.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have O, in case O is not in the word.\n\nFor example, are there words starting with PR without O and without excluded letters?\n\nFor instance:\n\n- PRUTA: A excluded.\n- PRUNT: N excluded.\n- PRY: too short.\n- PRYED: E excluded.\n- PRYER: E excluded.\n- PRYSE: S and E excluded.\n- PRYDE: E excluded.\n\nWhat about ""PREDY""? E excluded.\n\n""PREXY"": E excluded.\n\n""PRIMY"": I excluded.\n\n""PRISS"": I and S excluded.\n\n""PRINK"": I and N excluded.\n\n""PRIGS"": I and S excluded.\n\n""PRICK"": I and C excluded.\n\n""PRIDE"": I and E excluded.\n\n""PRIED"": I and E excluded.\n\n""PRESS"": E and S excluded.\n\n""PRATS"": A and S excluded.\n\n""PRATT"": A excluded.\n\n""PRAWN"": A excluded.\n\n""PRAD"": too short.\n\n""PRAT"": too short.\n\n""PRED"": too short.\n\n""PREF"": too short.\n\n""PREP"": E excluded.\n\n""PREX"": E excluded.\n\n""PRIG"": I? But we have I excluded, so no.\n\n""PRIT"": not common.\n\n""PRO"": too short.\n\n""PRY"": too short.\n\nSo, it seems that with the exclusions, the only common words are those with O in the third position, like PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PROOF.\n\nPROOF is P,R,O,O,F.\n\nBut F is possible.\n\nAnother word: ""PROUL"" not word.\n\n""PROKE"" E excluded.\n\nSo, I think we have to go with one of these.\n\nPerhaps ""PROBE"" but E excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, let\'s choose PROUD as it is a common word.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""PROUD"".\n\nBut note: in the feedback, for PROUD, we know P and R will be correct, so we only need to see the feedback for O, U, D.\n\nIf the word is PROUD, we win.\n\nIf not, we get information about O, U, D.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third.\n\nWe could also consider testing more letters.\n\nFor example, instead of guessing a possible word, we could guess a word that tests different letters in the positions.\n\nBut since we have two fixed, and three unknown, and many letters excluded, it might be better to guess a possible word.\n\nFor instance, we could guess ""PLUMB"" but that doesn\'t start with PR? We know it starts with PR, so we must have P and R fixed.\n\nSo, the guess must start with PR.\n\nTherefore, we are limited.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word like ""PRW..."" but no, not a word.\n\nSo, I think PROUD is a good choice.\n\nLet\'s go with PROUD.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (not in word), R (correct position), A (not in word), N (not in word), E (not in word). This confirms:\n  - The second letter is R.\n  - C, A, N, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- **Guess 2 (PRISM)**: P (correct position), R (correct position), I (not in word), S (not in word), M (not in word). This confirms:\n  - The first letter is P.\n  - The second letter is R (already known).\n  - I, S, and M are absent from the secret word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with ""PR"" (positions 1 and 2 are fixed).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, C, E, I, M, N, S.\n- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The word is of the form: P R _ _ _.\n- Common words fitting this pattern (without excluded letters) include PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, and PROOF. However, PROXY (with X and Y) is less common, and PROOF has a repeated O, which may reduce information gain if O is incorrect.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Since only positions 3–5 are unknown, I\'ll prioritize guessing a valid word that tests new high-frequency letters (e.g., O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.\n- ""PROUD"" is chosen because:\n  - It tests O (position 3), U (position 4), and D (position 5)—all common letters not yet tried.\n  - It avoids all excluded letters (A, C, E, I, M, N, S).\n  - If correct, it wins the game. If not, the feedback on O, U, and D will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., to words like PROWL or PROOF).\n\n<guess>proud</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: PRISM → P(✓), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is already known to be in position 2.
- I, S, M are not in the word.

So far, we know:
- Positions 1 and 2 are P and R.
- Excluded letters: A, C, E, I, M, N, S. So the word cannot contain any of these.
- The word is PR _ _ _

Now, Guess 3: PROUD → P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), D(x)
- P (position 1) correct, R (position 2) correct — expected.
- O is in the word and in the correct position? The feedback shows O(✓), meaning O is correct and in position 3.
- U is not in the word (x).
- D is not in the word (x).

Therefore:
- Position 3 is O. So now we have P R O _ _
- U and D are not in the word. Add U and D to the excluded list.

Updated known information:
- The secret word starts with ""PRO"" (positions 1,2,3: P, R, O).
- Excluded letters: A, C, D, E, I, M, N, S, U. (Total: 9 letters excluded)
- Remaining positions: 4 and 5.
- The word is of the form: P R O _ _

We need to find a 5-letter word starting with ""PRO"" that does not contain any excluded letters and has no U or D.

Possible letters for positions 4 and 5: we have the alphabet minus excluded letters. Excluded: A,C,D,E,I,M,N,S,U. So we can use: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note:
- O is already used in position 3; it can be repeated? Possibly, but we don't have evidence of repetition.
- P and R are in positions 1 and 2; they could be repeated? But typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, so we must consider that.

But let's list common words starting with ""PRO"" that fit.

Common possibilities:
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L) → checks W and L.
- PROOF (P,R,O,O,F) → repeats O and F at position 5.
- PROXY (P,R,O,X,Y) → uses X and Y.
- PROBE? But E is excluded, no.
- PRONG? N excluded, no.
- PROVE? V and E excluded (E is excluded).
- PROSE? S and E excluded, both out.
- PROSY? S excluded.
- PROEM? E excluded.
- PROUD? We already guessed, and D and U are out.

Since U and D are out, PROUD is incorrect, which we know.

Now, PROWL: letters W and L not excluded? W and L are not in the excluded list, so valid candidate.

PROOF: O repeated, F. F is okay.

PROXY: X and Y, less common but possible.

Other words:
- PROGS? S excluded, no.
- PROLE? E excluded.
- PROUL? Not a word.
- PRORS? Not a word.
- PROSO? S excluded.
- PROC? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""PROLL"" (not common) or ""PROKE"" (E excluded).

Another word: ""PROST"" S excluded.

So the plausible words are PROWL, PROOF, and PROXY.

We need to guess one, and we can use this to test the remaining letters.

We could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But note that we only have positions 4 and 5 unknown.

We should choose a word that can distinguish between these options.

For our next guess, we could guess PROWL, which tests W in position 4 and L in position 5.

If correct, we win; if not, we get feedback on W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests O in position 4 and F in position 5? PROOF is P-R-O-O-F, so position 4 is O, position 5 is F.

But in the secret word, position 3 is O, so if O is repeated, position 4 being O might be possible.

In PROXY, position 4 is X, position 5 is Y.

We should prioritize more common letters.

O is common, but we already know one O. Repetition is possible.

W, L, F, X, Y are candidates.

We can also consider if there are other words.

What about ""PROLOG""? Too long.

""PROT"" not 5 letters.

""PRO H""? No.

Another possibility: ""PROBB"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PROGR"" not.

""PRO T"" separate.

Notable: ""PROVE"" has E, excluded.

""PRONE"" E excluded.

""PRONE"" not valid.

So back to PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Let's test PROWL: it has W and L, both new.

PROOF has O (repeated) and F.

To maximize information, guessing a word with new letters not in previous guesses is good.

Previous guesses used: CRANE: C,R,A,N,E; PRISM: P,R,I,S,M; PROUD: P,R,O,U,D.

So we have used C,R,A,N,E,P,I,S,M,O,U,D.

The remaining letters, especially for positions 4 and 5, we haven't tested: for example, W, L, F, X, Y, from the candidates.

If we guess PROWL, we test W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests F and implicitly tests for O repetition.

But since we have no evidence of repetition, PROWL might be better.

PROXY tests X and Y, but they are rare.

Moreover, PROWL is a very common word.

Therefore, I'll guess PROWL.

So, the next guess: PROWL.
