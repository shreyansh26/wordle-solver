We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I will choose ""ROAST"" as my first guess. It has R, O, A, S, T — which are all common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me compare:

 - ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> covers 5 common letters, including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
 - ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> includes O and A (vowels) and R, S, T (consonants). Also very common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers a good set and has the vowel 'E' which is the most common letter.

 But note: the feedback will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since it's the first guess, any of these are fine. I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is: CRANE
</think>
I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. A good starting word typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and avoid repeats. 

I'll go with **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E appear in many 5-letter words, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It avoids rare letters like J, Q, X, or Z.

This guess will give me feedback on the positions of these letters, helping me narrow down the secret word for my next attempt.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
And it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don't know about S and B yet.

But note: we must avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.

But we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

I think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.

We know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have position 5 fixed as E.

So the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

We know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.

But we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).

Let me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? 
- S: new
- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). 
But we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That's a possibility.

But note: we don't know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's consider ""SAUTE"": 
- S at position 1
- A at position 2
- U at position 3
- T at position 4
- E at position 5

This avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.

But note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it's in the word? No, we don't have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don't include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So including A is a good idea.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.

So we need a word where A is not in position 3.

How about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. But that's okay. Also, A is in position 2.

But we have two T's? That might be less common, but it's acceptable.

Another idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a '-' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:
- If the secret word has only one A and it's not in position 3, then we get 'x' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it's correct, we get a check, or if it's wrong we get '-'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get 'x' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn't a second A? It's complicated.

To keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.

Words with A in position 4: 
- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. 
Actually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.

So let's think: 
- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E

Examples: 
- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.
- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.

What about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.

To have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.
- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.
- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.

Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.

More common is A in the first or second position.

So let's try A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E
Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N.

So:
- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don't know if that's a problem. Also, B and S are new.
- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.
- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.

All these avoid C, R, N.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E
Examples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.

So: 
- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.
- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.
- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.
- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.

Another good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.

But ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

In ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).

In ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.

Another idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it's there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.

I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.

So my next guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm: 
- S at 1: new
- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.
- U at 3: new
- T at 4: new
- E at 5: known to be correct.

And we avoid C, R, N.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""saute"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
It must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  
The next guess should:
- End with E to maintain the known correct position.
- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

""Saute"" is a strong choice because:
- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It avoids C, R, and N.
- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.

<guess>saute</guess>",saute,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
And it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don't know about S and B yet.

But note: we must avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.

But we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

I think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.

We know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have position 5 fixed as E.

So the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

We know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.

But we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).

Let me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? 
- S: new
- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). 
But we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That's a possibility.

But note: we don't know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's consider ""SAUTE"": 
- S at position 1
- A at position 2
- U at position 3
- T at position 4
- E at position 5

This avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.

But note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it's in the word? No, we don't have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don't include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So including A is a good idea.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.

So we need a word where A is not in position 3.

How about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. But that's okay. Also, A is in position 2.

But we have two T's? That might be less common, but it's acceptable.

Another idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a '-' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:
- If the secret word has only one A and it's not in position 3, then we get 'x' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it's correct, we get a check, or if it's wrong we get '-'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get 'x' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn't a second A? It's complicated.

To keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.

Words with A in position 4: 
- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. 
Actually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.

So let's think: 
- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E

Examples: 
- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.
- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.

What about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.

To have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.
- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.
- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.

Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.

More common is A in the first or second position.

So let's try A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E
Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N.

So:
- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don't know if that's a problem. Also, B and S are new.
- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.
- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.

All these avoid C, R, N.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E
Examples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.

So: 
- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.
- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.
- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.
- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.

Another good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.

But ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

In ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).

In ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.

Another idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it's there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.

I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.

So my next guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm: 
- S at 1: new
- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.
- U at 3: new
- T at 4: new
- E at 5: known to be correct.

And we avoid C, R, N.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""saute"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
It must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  
The next guess should:
- End with E to maintain the known correct position.
- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

""Saute"" is a strong choice because:
- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It avoids C, R, and N.
- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.",Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I will choose ""ROAST"" as my first guess. It has R, O, A, S, T — which are all common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me compare:

 - ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> covers 5 common letters, including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
 - ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> includes O and A (vowels) and R, S, T (consonants). Also very common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers a good set and has the vowel 'E' which is the most common letter.

 But note: the feedback will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since it's the first guess, any of these are fine. I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is: CRANEI need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. A good starting word typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and avoid repeats. 

I'll go with **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E appear in many 5-letter words, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It avoids rare letters like J, Q, X, or Z.

This guess will give me feedback on the positions of these letters, helping me narrow down the secret word for my next attempt.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
And it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don't know about S and B yet.

But note: we must avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.

But we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

I think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.

We know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have position 5 fixed as E.

So the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

We know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.

But we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).

Let me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? 
- S: new
- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). 
But we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That's a possibility.

But note: we don't know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's consider ""SAUTE"": 
- S at position 1
- A at position 2
- U at position 3
- T at position 4
- E at position 5

This avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.

But note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it's in the word? No, we don't have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don't include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So including A is a good idea.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.

So we need a word where A is not in position 3.

How about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. But that's okay. Also, A is in position 2.

But we have two T's? That might be less common, but it's acceptable.

Another idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a '-' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:
- If the secret word has only one A and it's not in position 3, then we get 'x' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it's correct, we get a check, or if it's wrong we get '-'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get 'x' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn't a second A? It's complicated.

To keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.

Words with A in position 4: 
- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. 
Actually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.

So let's think: 
- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E

Examples: 
- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.
- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.

What about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.

To have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.
- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.
- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.

Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.

More common is A in the first or second position.

So let's try A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E
Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N.

So:
- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don't know if that's a problem. Also, B and S are new.
- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.
- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.

All these avoid C, R, N.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E
Examples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.

So: 
- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.
- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.
- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.
- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.

Another good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.

But ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

In ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).

In ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.

Another idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it's there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.

I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.

So my next guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm: 
- S at 1: new
- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.
- U at 3: new
- T at 4: new
- E at 5: known to be correct.

And we avoid C, R, N.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""saute"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
It must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  
The next guess should:
- End with E to maintain the known correct position.
- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

""Saute"" is a strong choice because:
- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It avoids C, R, and N.
- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.\n\n I will choose ""ROAST"" as my first guess. It has R, O, A, S, T — which are all common letters.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries. Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me compare:\n\n - ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> covers 5 common letters, including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n - ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> includes O and A (vowels) and R, S, T (consonants). Also very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers a good set and has the vowel \'E\' which is the most common letter.\n\n But note: the feedback will help us narrow down the next guess.\n\n Since it\'s the first guess, any of these are fine. I choose ""CRANE"".\n\n So, my first guess is: CRANEI need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. A good starting word typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. \n\nCommon vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and avoid repeats. \n\nI\'ll go with **""CRANE""** because:\n- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).\n- The letters C, R, A, N, and E appear in many 5-letter words, increasing the chance of useful feedback.\n- It avoids rare letters like J, Q, X, or Z.\n\nThis guess will give me feedback on the positions of these letters, helping me narrow down the secret word for my next attempt.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)\n\nSo, we know:\n1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).\n2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E\nAnd it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)\n- Includes the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.\n- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don\'t know about S and B yet.\n\nBut note: we must avoid C, R, N.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nI think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.\n\nWe know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have position 5 fixed as E.\n\nSo the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nWe know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.\n\nWe can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.\n\nBut we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).\n\nLet me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? \n- S: new\n- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). \nBut we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That\'s a possibility.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nSo for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nNow, let\'s consider ""SAUTE"": \n- S at position 1\n- A at position 2\n- U at position 3\n- T at position 4\n- E at position 5\n\nThis avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it\'s in the word? No, we don\'t have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don\'t include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.\n\nSo including A is a good idea.\n\nAnother option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let\'s see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.\n\nSo we need a word where A is not in position 3.\n\nHow about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. But that\'s okay. Also, A is in position 2.\n\nBut we have two T\'s? That might be less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a \'-\' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:\n- If the secret word has only one A and it\'s not in position 3, then we get \'x\' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it\'s correct, we get a check, or if it\'s wrong we get \'-\'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get \'x\' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn\'t a second A? It\'s complicated.\n\nTo keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.\n\nWords with A in position 4: \n- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. \nActually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.\n\nSo let\'s think: \n- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E\n\nExamples: \n- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.\n- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.\n\nSo we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.\n\nWhat about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.\n\nTo have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.\n- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.\n- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.\n\nMore common is A in the first or second position.\n\nSo let\'s try A in position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 1: A _ _ _ E\nExamples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo:\n- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don\'t know if that\'s a problem. Also, B and S are new.\n- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.\n- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.\n- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.\n- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.\n\nAll these avoid C, R, N.\n\nPosition 2: _ A _ _ E\nExamples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.\n\nSo: \n- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.\n- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.\n- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.\n- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.\n\nAnother good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.\n\nBut ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven\'t tested O, I, U, etc.\n\nIn ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).\n\nIn ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.\n\nAnother idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it\'s there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.\n\nSo my next guess: SAUTE\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S at 1: new\n- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.\n- U at 3: new\n- T at 4: new\n- E at 5: known to be correct.\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo, I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""saute"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  \nIt must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  \nThe next guess should:\n- End with E to maintain the known correct position.\n- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.\n- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\n""Saute"" is a strong choice because:\n- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).\n- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- It avoids C, R, and N.\n- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

From Guess 2 (""saute""):
- S: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) — note that in ""saute"", A is at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is E, it can't be there).
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is a valid English word.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E
A must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known E at position 5)
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test which one it is)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T
- Uses new common letters to get more information

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Option 1: Put A in position 1. Then the word would be A _ _ _ E.
Option 2: Put A in position 4. Then the word would be _ _ _ A E.

We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The absent letters so far are C, R, N, S, U, T. So we can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider both options:

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with new letters. For example:
- Words like ""ABIDE"", ""ABODE"", ""ABOVE"", ""ADOBE"", etc.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. For ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E — all letters B, I, D are not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
This is a bit trickier because the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. Words like: 
- ""BLARE"" but R is absent, so invalid.
- ""PHASE"" but S is absent.
- ""PLACE"" but C is absent.

Actually, it's hard to find common words ending with ""AE"" because that pattern is rare. More common is ""A_E"" at the end, but with A in position 4? For example, ""IMAGE"" has A in position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> A is position 3. We need A in position 4: so the word must be ? ? ? A E.

Examples: 
- ""IDEA"" is 4 letters.
- ""PIZZA"" no E.
- ""FLAKE"" has A in position 3? F-L-A-K-E -> position 3.

Actually, I can't think of many 5-letter words ending with ""AE"". Let me think: 
- ""URAE"" is not 5 letters.
- ""RENAE"" but R and E? R-E-N-A-E -> that's 5 letters? R(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), E(5). But N and R are absent, so invalid.

Another: ""DIVAE"" — not a common word.

It seems that having A in position 4 and E in 5 is very rare. Therefore, it's more likely that A is in position 1.

So, let's focus on words starting with A and ending with E.

Possible words: 
- ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABOVE, ADOBE, AGAPE, AGATE, ALIVE, ALIKE, ALONE, AMAZE, AMBLE, AMIDE, AMINE, AMOLE, AMPLE, ANISE (but N is absent), APPLE, ARISE (R absent), etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, S, U, T.

So:
- ABASE: has S (absent) -> invalid.
- ABATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> B, I, D are new -> valid.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D new -> valid.
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> B, O, V new -> valid.
- ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E -> D, O, B new -> valid (same as ABODE but different order).
- AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> A repeated, but we don't know if A is repeated? It could be, but we only know one A is present. Also, G and P are new.
- AGATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E -> L, I, V new -> valid.
- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E -> L, I, K new -> valid.
- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> N is absent -> invalid.
- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> A repeated, M, Z new -> valid, but Z is less common.
- AMBLE: A, M, B, L, E -> M, B, L new -> valid.
- AMIDE: A, M, I, D, E -> M, I, D new -> valid.
- AMINE: has N -> invalid.
- AMOLE: A, M, O, L, E -> M, O, L new -> valid.
- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> M, P, L new -> valid.
- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> P repeated, and we don't know, but valid? But we have to avoid absent letters, and P is new.

We have many options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we have many positions to fill (positions 2,3,4) and we don't know much, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

A good candidate might be ""ALIVE"": tests A in position 1, and L, I, V, E (with E fixed). But V is less common.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D.

""AMBLE"": tests M, B, L.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L.

I think ""ALIVE"" is a good word because it has common letters except V, but V is worth testing.

But let's see the frequency: L, I, V are all fairly common.

Another idea: we can try to test multiple vowels. We have A and E, so testing I and O might be good.

But in ""ALIVE"", we have I.

We could do ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E. K is also common.

But let's choose one.

I think ""ABIDE"" is a solid choice because B, I, D are common.

But note: we have to consider that if A is not in position 1, then we will get a '-' for A, meaning it must be in position 4. But we already saw that position 4 is difficult, so it's a risk.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that possibility directly, but as we saw, it's hard to find such words without using absent letters.

Let me try to find a word with A in position 4 and E in 5, without C,R,N,S,U,T.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" but B-L-A-D-E -> A is position 3, not 4.
- ""GRACE"" has R and C.
- ""SHADE"" has S and H? S is absent.
- ""PHASE"" has S and P? S is absent.

Actually, I found one: ""OWARE"" — but that's not common, and O-W-A-R-E, R is absent.

Another: ""KNAVE"" has N and K? N absent.

""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> A is position 2, not 4.

It seems very difficult. Perhaps ""ILIAD"" but that doesn't end with E.

I think it's safe to assume that A is in position 1, because position 4 is rare.

So I'll go with a word starting with A and ending with E.

Now, among the options, ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because it tests L, I, V.

But V is less common than, say, B or D.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D — all high frequency.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L — also high frequency.

Let me choose ""ABIDE"" for this guess.

So, guess: ABIDE

But let's see the positions:
- A in position 1: if A is actually in position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in position 4, we get a '-' (since it's present but not in 1).
- Then we also get feedback on B, I, D.

If we get A correct, then we know position 1 is A, and we have _ _ _ E with A at start.

If not, then A must be in position 4.

But since position 4 is rare, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that has A in position 4? But we can't find one easily.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be inefficient because we would waste a guess not testing A's position.

So we must include A.

I think ""ABIDE"" is fine.

But let me check if there's a word that can test both possibilities? For example, if we put A in position 4, but we can't find one.

Perhaps ""AGAPE"" but that has A in position 1 and 3? But position 3 we know is not A, so if we put A in position 3, we might get an 'x' for that position, which tells us nothing new (we already know A is not in position 3). So it's better to avoid position 3.

In ""AGAPE"": A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). The A in position 3 will be incorrect, and we know that, so it's a wasted letter. So not ideal.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABIDE"".

So the next guess is ""abide"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: E is confirmed in position 5 again, A is present but not in position 2, and S, U, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**: The secret word ends with E.
2. **A must be in position 1 or 4**: A is present but not in position 2 (from saute) or 3 (from crane), and position 5 is E, so A cannot be there.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T cannot be in the word.
4. **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ _ _ E`, with A in position 1 or 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test A in position 1**: Since A in position 4 is rare (few common words end with ""AE""), prioritize testing A in position 1 to resolve its location efficiently.
- **Introduce new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, I, L, M, O, P) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.
- **Choose a word starting with A and ending with E**: This tests position 1 for A while maintaining E in position 5.

**Selected word: ABIDE**  
- A in position 1: Tests if A is in the correct starting position.
- B, I, D: New common letters (B and D are consonants, I is a vowel) that provide broad coverage.
- E in position 5: Confirmed correct, so it stays.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

If A is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter. If not, A must be in position 4 (narrowing possibilities significantly). Feedback on B, I, and D will further refine the search.

<guess>abide</guess>",abide,"We have the following feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

From Guess 2 (""saute""):
- S: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) — note that in ""saute"", A is at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is E, it can't be there).
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is a valid English word.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E
A must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known E at position 5)
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test which one it is)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T
- Uses new common letters to get more information

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Option 1: Put A in position 1. Then the word would be A _ _ _ E.
Option 2: Put A in position 4. Then the word would be _ _ _ A E.

We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The absent letters so far are C, R, N, S, U, T. So we can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider both options:

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with new letters. For example:
- Words like ""ABIDE"", ""ABODE"", ""ABOVE"", ""ADOBE"", etc.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. For ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E — all letters B, I, D are not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
This is a bit trickier because the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. Words like: 
- ""BLARE"" but R is absent, so invalid.
- ""PHASE"" but S is absent.
- ""PLACE"" but C is absent.

Actually, it's hard to find common words ending with ""AE"" because that pattern is rare. More common is ""A_E"" at the end, but with A in position 4? For example, ""IMAGE"" has A in position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> A is position 3. We need A in position 4: so the word must be ? ? ? A E.

Examples: 
- ""IDEA"" is 4 letters.
- ""PIZZA"" no E.
- ""FLAKE"" has A in position 3? F-L-A-K-E -> position 3.

Actually, I can't think of many 5-letter words ending with ""AE"". Let me think: 
- ""URAE"" is not 5 letters.
- ""RENAE"" but R and E? R-E-N-A-E -> that's 5 letters? R(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), E(5). But N and R are absent, so invalid.

Another: ""DIVAE"" — not a common word.

It seems that having A in position 4 and E in 5 is very rare. Therefore, it's more likely that A is in position 1.

So, let's focus on words starting with A and ending with E.

Possible words: 
- ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABOVE, ADOBE, AGAPE, AGATE, ALIVE, ALIKE, ALONE, AMAZE, AMBLE, AMIDE, AMINE, AMOLE, AMPLE, ANISE (but N is absent), APPLE, ARISE (R absent), etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, S, U, T.

So:
- ABASE: has S (absent) -> invalid.
- ABATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> B, I, D are new -> valid.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D new -> valid.
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> B, O, V new -> valid.
- ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E -> D, O, B new -> valid (same as ABODE but different order).
- AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> A repeated, but we don't know if A is repeated? It could be, but we only know one A is present. Also, G and P are new.
- AGATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E -> L, I, V new -> valid.
- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E -> L, I, K new -> valid.
- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> N is absent -> invalid.
- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> A repeated, M, Z new -> valid, but Z is less common.
- AMBLE: A, M, B, L, E -> M, B, L new -> valid.
- AMIDE: A, M, I, D, E -> M, I, D new -> valid.
- AMINE: has N -> invalid.
- AMOLE: A, M, O, L, E -> M, O, L new -> valid.
- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> M, P, L new -> valid.
- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> P repeated, and we don't know, but valid? But we have to avoid absent letters, and P is new.

We have many options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we have many positions to fill (positions 2,3,4) and we don't know much, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

A good candidate might be ""ALIVE"": tests A in position 1, and L, I, V, E (with E fixed). But V is less common.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D.

""AMBLE"": tests M, B, L.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L.

I think ""ALIVE"" is a good word because it has common letters except V, but V is worth testing.

But let's see the frequency: L, I, V are all fairly common.

Another idea: we can try to test multiple vowels. We have A and E, so testing I and O might be good.

But in ""ALIVE"", we have I.

We could do ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E. K is also common.

But let's choose one.

I think ""ABIDE"" is a solid choice because B, I, D are common.

But note: we have to consider that if A is not in position 1, then we will get a '-' for A, meaning it must be in position 4. But we already saw that position 4 is difficult, so it's a risk.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that possibility directly, but as we saw, it's hard to find such words without using absent letters.

Let me try to find a word with A in position 4 and E in 5, without C,R,N,S,U,T.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" but B-L-A-D-E -> A is position 3, not 4.
- ""GRACE"" has R and C.
- ""SHADE"" has S and H? S is absent.
- ""PHASE"" has S and P? S is absent.

Actually, I found one: ""OWARE"" — but that's not common, and O-W-A-R-E, R is absent.

Another: ""KNAVE"" has N and K? N absent.

""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> A is position 2, not 4.

It seems very difficult. Perhaps ""ILIAD"" but that doesn't end with E.

I think it's safe to assume that A is in position 1, because position 4 is rare.

So I'll go with a word starting with A and ending with E.

Now, among the options, ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because it tests L, I, V.

But V is less common than, say, B or D.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D — all high frequency.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L — also high frequency.

Let me choose ""ABIDE"" for this guess.

So, guess: ABIDE

But let's see the positions:
- A in position 1: if A is actually in position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in position 4, we get a '-' (since it's present but not in 1).
- Then we also get feedback on B, I, D.

If we get A correct, then we know position 1 is A, and we have _ _ _ E with A at start.

If not, then A must be in position 4.

But since position 4 is rare, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that has A in position 4? But we can't find one easily.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be inefficient because we would waste a guess not testing A's position.

So we must include A.

I think ""ABIDE"" is fine.

But let me check if there's a word that can test both possibilities? For example, if we put A in position 4, but we can't find one.

Perhaps ""AGAPE"" but that has A in position 1 and 3? But position 3 we know is not A, so if we put A in position 3, we might get an 'x' for that position, which tells us nothing new (we already know A is not in position 3). So it's better to avoid position 3.

In ""AGAPE"": A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). The A in position 3 will be incorrect, and we know that, so it's a wasted letter. So not ideal.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABIDE"".

So the next guess is ""abide"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: E is confirmed in position 5 again, A is present but not in position 2, and S, U, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**: The secret word ends with E.
2. **A must be in position 1 or 4**: A is present but not in position 2 (from saute) or 3 (from crane), and position 5 is E, so A cannot be there.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T cannot be in the word.
4. **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ _ _ E`, with A in position 1 or 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test A in position 1**: Since A in position 4 is rare (few common words end with ""AE""), prioritize testing A in position 1 to resolve its location efficiently.
- **Introduce new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, I, L, M, O, P) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.
- **Choose a word starting with A and ending with E**: This tests position 1 for A while maintaining E in position 5.

**Selected word: ABIDE**  
- A in position 1: Tests if A is in the correct starting position.
- B, I, D: New common letters (B and D are consonants, I is a vowel) that provide broad coverage.
- E in position 5: Confirmed correct, so it stays.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

If A is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter. If not, A must be in position 4 (narrowing possibilities significantly). Feedback on B, I, and D will further refine the search.",Guess 3: abide -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I will choose ""ROAST"" as my first guess. It has R, O, A, S, T — which are all common letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me compare:

 - ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> covers 5 common letters, including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).
 - ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> includes O and A (vowels) and R, S, T (consonants). Also very common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one: S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it covers a good set and has the vowel 'E' which is the most common letter.

 But note: the feedback will help us narrow down the next guess.

 Since it's the first guess, any of these are fine. I choose ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is: CRANEI need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I can get. A good starting word typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

Common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROAST"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and avoid repeats. 

I'll go with **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E appear in many 5-letter words, increasing the chance of useful feedback.
- It avoids rare letters like J, Q, X, or Z.

This guess will give me feedback on the positions of these letters, helping me narrow down the secret word for my next attempt.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
And it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.
- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

We can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don't know about S and B yet.

But note: we must avoid C, R, N.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.

Let me list some possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.

But we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

I think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven't tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.

We know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we have position 5 fixed as E.

So the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

We know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.

We can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.

But we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).

Let me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? 
- S: new
- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). 
But we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That's a possibility.

But note: we don't know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's consider ""SAUTE"": 
- S at position 1
- A at position 2
- U at position 3
- T at position 4
- E at position 5

This avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.

But note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it's in the word? No, we don't have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don't include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.

So including A is a good idea.

Another option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.

So we need a word where A is not in position 3.

How about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. But that's okay. Also, A is in position 2.

But we have two T's? That might be less common, but it's acceptable.

Another idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a '-' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:
- If the secret word has only one A and it's not in position 3, then we get 'x' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it's correct, we get a check, or if it's wrong we get '-'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get 'x' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn't a second A? It's complicated.

To keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.

So let's avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.

Words with A in position 4: 
- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. 
Actually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.

So let's think: 
- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E

Examples: 
- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.
- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.

What about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.

To have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E

Examples: 
- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.
- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.
- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.

Actually, it's hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.

More common is A in the first or second position.

So let's try A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E
Examples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N.

So:
- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don't know if that's a problem. Also, B and S are new.
- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.
- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.

All these avoid C, R, N.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E
Examples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.

So: 
- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.
- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.
- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.
- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.

Another good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.

But ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.

We have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

In ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).

In ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.

Another idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it's there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.

But position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.

I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.

So my next guess: SAUTE

But let me confirm: 
- S at 1: new
- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.
- U at 3: new
- T at 4: new
- E at 5: known to be correct.

And we avoid C, R, N.

So, I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""saute"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  
It must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  
The next guess should:
- End with E to maintain the known correct position.
- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.

""Saute"" is a strong choice because:
- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It avoids C, R, and N.
- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.

<guess>saute</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

From Guess 2 (""saute""):
- S: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) — note that in ""saute"", A is at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

So, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 5 is E, it can't be there).
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and is a valid English word.

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E
A must be in position 1 or 4.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (to keep the known E at position 5)
- Includes A in either position 1 or 4 (to test which one it is)
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T
- Uses new common letters to get more information

Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we can design a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

Option 1: Put A in position 1. Then the word would be A _ _ _ E.
Option 2: Put A in position 4. Then the word would be _ _ _ A E.

We should also include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. The absent letters so far are C, R, N, S, U, T. So we can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's consider both options:

Option 1: A _ _ _ E
We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with new letters. For example:
- Words like ""ABIDE"", ""ABODE"", ""ABOVE"", ""ADOBE"", etc.

But note: we must avoid the absent letters. For ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E — all letters B, I, D are not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Option 2: _ _ _ A E
This is a bit trickier because the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. Words like: 
- ""BLARE"" but R is absent, so invalid.
- ""PHASE"" but S is absent.
- ""PLACE"" but C is absent.

Actually, it's hard to find common words ending with ""AE"" because that pattern is rare. More common is ""A_E"" at the end, but with A in position 4? For example, ""IMAGE"" has A in position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> A is position 3. We need A in position 4: so the word must be ? ? ? A E.

Examples: 
- ""IDEA"" is 4 letters.
- ""PIZZA"" no E.
- ""FLAKE"" has A in position 3? F-L-A-K-E -> position 3.

Actually, I can't think of many 5-letter words ending with ""AE"". Let me think: 
- ""URAE"" is not 5 letters.
- ""RENAE"" but R and E? R-E-N-A-E -> that's 5 letters? R(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), E(5). But N and R are absent, so invalid.

Another: ""DIVAE"" — not a common word.

It seems that having A in position 4 and E in 5 is very rare. Therefore, it's more likely that A is in position 1.

So, let's focus on words starting with A and ending with E.

Possible words: 
- ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABOVE, ADOBE, AGAPE, AGATE, ALIVE, ALIKE, ALONE, AMAZE, AMBLE, AMIDE, AMINE, AMOLE, AMPLE, ANISE (but N is absent), APPLE, ARISE (R absent), etc.

But we must avoid C, R, N, S, U, T.

So:
- ABASE: has S (absent) -> invalid.
- ABATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> B, I, D are new -> valid.
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D new -> valid.
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> B, O, V new -> valid.
- ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E -> D, O, B new -> valid (same as ABODE but different order).
- AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> A repeated, but we don't know if A is repeated? It could be, but we only know one A is present. Also, G and P are new.
- AGATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.
- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E -> L, I, V new -> valid.
- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E -> L, I, K new -> valid.
- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> N is absent -> invalid.
- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> A repeated, M, Z new -> valid, but Z is less common.
- AMBLE: A, M, B, L, E -> M, B, L new -> valid.
- AMIDE: A, M, I, D, E -> M, I, D new -> valid.
- AMINE: has N -> invalid.
- AMOLE: A, M, O, L, E -> M, O, L new -> valid.
- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> M, P, L new -> valid.
- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> P repeated, and we don't know, but valid? But we have to avoid absent letters, and P is new.

We have many options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Since we have many positions to fill (positions 2,3,4) and we don't know much, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: L, I, O, D, M, P, B, G, etc.

A good candidate might be ""ALIVE"": tests A in position 1, and L, I, V, E (with E fixed). But V is less common.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D.

""AMBLE"": tests M, B, L.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L.

I think ""ALIVE"" is a good word because it has common letters except V, but V is worth testing.

But let's see the frequency: L, I, V are all fairly common.

Another idea: we can try to test multiple vowels. We have A and E, so testing I and O might be good.

But in ""ALIVE"", we have I.

We could do ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E. K is also common.

But let's choose one.

I think ""ABIDE"" is a solid choice because B, I, D are common.

But note: we have to consider that if A is not in position 1, then we will get a '-' for A, meaning it must be in position 4. But we already saw that position 4 is difficult, so it's a risk.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that possibility directly, but as we saw, it's hard to find such words without using absent letters.

Let me try to find a word with A in position 4 and E in 5, without C,R,N,S,U,T.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" but B-L-A-D-E -> A is position 3, not 4.
- ""GRACE"" has R and C.
- ""SHADE"" has S and H? S is absent.
- ""PHASE"" has S and P? S is absent.

Actually, I found one: ""OWARE"" — but that's not common, and O-W-A-R-E, R is absent.

Another: ""KNAVE"" has N and K? N absent.

""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> A is position 2, not 4.

It seems very difficult. Perhaps ""ILIAD"" but that doesn't end with E.

I think it's safe to assume that A is in position 1, because position 4 is rare.

So I'll go with a word starting with A and ending with E.

Now, among the options, ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because it tests L, I, V.

But V is less common than, say, B or D.

""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D — all high frequency.

""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L — also high frequency.

Let me choose ""ABIDE"" for this guess.

So, guess: ABIDE

But let's see the positions:
- A in position 1: if A is actually in position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in position 4, we get a '-' (since it's present but not in 1).
- Then we also get feedback on B, I, D.

If we get A correct, then we know position 1 is A, and we have _ _ _ E with A at start.

If not, then A must be in position 4.

But since position 4 is rare, we might get lucky.

Alternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that has A in position 4? But we can't find one easily.

Another idea: we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be inefficient because we would waste a guess not testing A's position.

So we must include A.

I think ""ABIDE"" is fine.

But let me check if there's a word that can test both possibilities? For example, if we put A in position 4, but we can't find one.

Perhaps ""AGAPE"" but that has A in position 1 and 3? But position 3 we know is not A, so if we put A in position 3, we might get an 'x' for that position, which tells us nothing new (we already know A is not in position 3). So it's better to avoid position 3.

In ""AGAPE"": A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). The A in position 3 will be incorrect, and we know that, so it's a wasted letter. So not ideal.

Therefore, I'll go with ""ABIDE"".

So the next guess is ""abide"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: E is confirmed in position 5 again, A is present but not in position 2, and S, U, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**: The secret word ends with E.
2. **A must be in position 1 or 4**: A is present but not in position 2 (from saute) or 3 (from crane), and position 5 is E, so A cannot be there.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T cannot be in the word.
4. **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ _ _ E`, with A in position 1 or 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test A in position 1**: Since A in position 4 is rare (few common words end with ""AE""), prioritize testing A in position 1 to resolve its location efficiently.
- **Introduce new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, I, L, M, O, P) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.
- **Choose a word starting with A and ending with E**: This tests position 1 for A while maintaining E in position 5.

**Selected word: ABIDE**  
- A in position 1: Tests if A is in the correct starting position.
- B, I, D: New common letters (B and D are consonants, I is a vowel) that provide broad coverage.
- E in position 5: Confirmed correct, so it stays.
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).

If A is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter. If not, A must be in position 4 (narrowing possibilities significantly). Feedback on B, I, and D will further refine the search.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.\n\n I will choose ""ROAST"" as my first guess. It has R, O, A, S, T — which are all common letters.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries. Another popular starting word is ""CRANE"". Let me compare:\n\n - ""CRANE"": C, R, A, N, E -> covers 5 common letters, including two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n - ""ROAST"": R, O, A, S, T -> includes O and A (vowels) and R, S, T (consonants).

The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).\n2. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", A is the third letter, and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E\nAnd it contains the letter A, but not in the third position (if we count positions starting at 1: position 1,2,3,4,5).\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (to keep the known correct letter)\n- Includes the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position (because in ""crane"" it was in the third and that was wrong). However, note that the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So A could be in position 1,2,4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is E, so A cannot be there. So A must be in position 1,2, or 4.\n- Avoids the letters C, R, and N.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to put A in a different position (not position 3) and also include other common letters.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that end with E and have A in position 1? Like ""ABASE"", but that has S and B. But we don\'t know about S and B yet.\n\nBut note: we must avoid C, R, N.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try a word that has A in position 1 or 2 and also includes other vowels or common consonants.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- If A is in position 1: words like ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABLE? (but ABLE is 4 letters), so 5-letter: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, etc.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we can try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nI think a good strategy is to try to put A in a position we haven\'t tested (so not position 3) and also test new letters.\n\nWe know A is not in position 3, so we can try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have position 5 fixed as E.\n\nSo the word pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nWe know A is one of letter1, letter2, or letter4.\n\nWe can try to put A in position 1 and then use other common letters for the rest.\n\nBut we also want to avoid reusing letters that are already known to be absent (C, R, N).\n\nLet me try to form a word: How about ""SAUTE""? \n- S: new\n- A: in position 2? Wait, in ""SAUTE"", A is in position 2? Actually: S (1), A (2), U (3), T (4), E (5). \nBut we know A is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. That\'s a possibility.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is in position 2 or not. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? Like ""PLATE"", but that has P, L, T, and A in position 4? Actually: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But wait, we know A is not in position 3? In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and we got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So in ""PLATE"", if we put A in position 3, that is the same position that was wrong before? But we are allowed to try, but it would be inefficient because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nSo for ""PLATE"", if we use it, A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3. So we should choose a word where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nNow, let\'s consider ""SAUTE"": \n- S at position 1\n- A at position 2\n- U at position 3\n- T at position 4\n- E at position 5\n\nThis avoids position 3 for A and tests new letters: S, A (in a new position), U, T.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use A again? Actually, we must use A because we know it\'s in the word? No, we don\'t have to, but it would be efficient to confirm its position. Also, we are allowed to use any word, but if we don\'t include A, we might miss information about its position. Since we know A is in the word, we should try to find its position.\n\nSo including A is a good idea.\n\nAnother option: ""SLATE"" -> S, L, A, T, E. But in ""SLATE"", A is in position 3 again? Let\'s see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe can try ""STALE"": S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) -> again A in position 3. Same problem.\n\nSo we need a word where A is not in position 3.\n\nHow about ""TASTE""? T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5). But T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. But that\'s okay. Also, A is in position 2.\n\nBut we have two T\'s? That might be less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother idea: ""ABATE"" -> A(1), B(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But now A is in position 3 again? And also repeated A. So we have A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears multiple times. However, we should avoid position 3 for A because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because if we get a \'-\' again, we only learn that there is another A? But the feedback for position 3 would be either:\n- If the secret word has only one A and it\'s not in position 3, then we get \'x\' for A in position 3? But wait, we already know A is in the word, so if we put A in a new position and it\'s correct, we get a check, or if it\'s wrong we get \'-\'. But if we put it in a position we already tried and it was wrong, we might get \'x\' meaning that position is not A and also that there isn\'t a second A? It\'s complicated.\n\nTo keep it simple, since we know A is in the word but not in position 3, we should test A in a new position (1,2, or 4) to see if it is there.\n\nSo let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, words with A in position 1,2, or 4.\n\nPosition 4: for example, ""PLATE"" has A in position 3? No, ""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E, so A is position 3. We need position 4? That would be the fourth letter.\n\nWords with A in position 4: \n- ...A.E -> for example, ""BLADE"" has A in position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3. \nActually, position 4: words like ""RANGE"" but R is not allowed (we know R is absent). Or ""MANGE"" but M and G, but also N is absent. We need to avoid R, C, N.\n\nSo let\'s think: \n- Position 4: A, then E at the end. So the word pattern: _ _ _ A E\n\nExamples: \n- ""PLEASE"": P-L-E-A-S-E -> 6 letters, too long.\n- ""GRACE"": G-R-A-C-E -> but R and C are absent, so not allowed? We cannot use R and C because they are not in the word. So we must avoid R and C.\n\nSo we need a 5-letter word ending with E, with A in position 4, and without C, R, N.\n\nWhat about ""PHASE"": P-H-A-S-E -> but A is in position 3? P(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So position 3 again.\n\nTo have A in position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. So the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]A E\n\nExamples: \n- ""PIZZA"" -> no E at the end.\n- ""PODIA""? P-O-D-I-A -> no E.\n- ""MEDIA"": M-E-D-I-A -> but that ends with A, not E.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find words with A in the fourth position and E at the end. Because the common pattern is that the last two letters are ""AE"", which is rare.\n\nMore common is A in the first or second position.\n\nSo let\'s try A in position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 1: A _ _ _ E\nExamples: ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABUSE, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo:\n- ABASE: A, B, A, S, E -> has A repeated? But we don\'t know if that\'s a problem. Also, B and S are new.\n- ABATE: A, B, A, T, E -> A repeated, B and T.\n- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> no repeat, and B, I, D are new.\n- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D.\n- ABUSE: A, B, U, S, E -> B, U, S.\n\nAll these avoid C, R, N.\n\nPosition 2: _ A _ _ E\nExamples: SALES, but S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), S(5) -> but E is at position 4, not 5? We need E at the end.\n\nSo: \n- ""SAUTE"": S(1), A(2), U(3), T(4), E(5) -> good.\n- ""PASTE"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S and T are common.\n- ""TASTE"": T(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> T repeated.\n- ""WAIVE"": W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5) -> W and V are less common.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in position 2), U, T, and we know E is at the end.\n\nAnother good one: ""ABIDE"" tests A in position 1 and B, I, D.\n\nBut ""SAUTE"" tests more common letters? S, T, U are common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more vowels. We have A and E (we know E is at the end). We haven\'t tested O, I, U, etc.\n\nIn ""SAUTE"", we test U (a vowel) and S, T (common consonants).\n\nIn ""ABIDE"", we test I (vowel) and B, D (consonants).\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be absent to maximize information. Since we have 6 tries, we can be aggressive.\n\nAnother idea: we know A is in the word, so we can try to put it in position 1 to see if it\'s there. If not, then it must be in position 2 or 4.\n\nBut position 4 is difficult, so probably position 2 is more likely.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SAUTE"" because it tests A in a new position (2) and also tests S, U, T.\n\nSo my next guess: SAUTE\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- S at 1: new\n- A at 2: we know A is in the word, but not in position 3, so position 2 is a candidate.\n- U at 3: new\n- T at 4: new\n- E at 5: known to be correct.\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, N.\n\nSo, I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""saute"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- A is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- E is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E  \nIt must contain A, but not in position 3 (so A is in position 1, 2, or 4).  \nThe next guess should:\n- End with E to maintain the known correct position.\n- Include A in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.\n- Avoid C, R, and N (since they are absent).\n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\n""Saute"" is a strong choice because:\n- It ends with E (position 5 is fixed).\n- A is in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- It avoids C, R, and N.\n- It tests new common letters: S, U, and T.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and provide feedback on S, U, and T.\n\n<guess>saute</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback so far:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: present but wrong position (-)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""saute""):\n- S: absent (x)\n- A: present but wrong position (-) — note that in ""saute"", A is at position 2\n- U: absent (x)\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\nSo, we know:\n1.

Then the word would be A _ _ _ E.\nOption 2: Put A in position 4. Then the word would be _ _ _ A E.\n\nWe should also include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. The absent letters so far are C, R, N, S, U, T. So we can use: B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nLet\'s consider both options:\n\nOption 1: A _ _ _ E\nWe need to fill positions 2, 3, and 4 with new letters. For example:\n- Words like ""ABIDE"", ""ABODE"", ""ABOVE"", ""ADOBE"", etc.\n\nBut note: we must avoid the absent letters. For ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E — all letters B, I, D are not in the absent list, so it\'s okay.\n\nOption 2: _ _ _ A E\nThis is a bit trickier because the fourth letter is A and fifth is E. Words like: \n- ""BLARE"" but R is absent, so invalid.\n- ""PHASE"" but S is absent.\n- ""PLACE"" but C is absent.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find common words ending with ""AE"" because that pattern is rare. More common is ""A_E"" at the end, but with A in position 4? For example, ""IMAGE"" has A in position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> A is position 3. We need A in position 4: so the word must be ? ? ? A E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""IDEA"" is 4 letters.\n- ""PIZZA"" no E.\n- ""FLAKE"" has A in position 3? F-L-A-K-E -> position 3.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of many 5-letter words ending with ""AE"". Let me think: \n- ""URAE"" is not 5 letters.\n- ""RENAE"" but R and E? R-E-N-A-E -> that\'s 5 letters? R(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), E(5). But N and R are absent, so invalid.\n\nAnother: ""DIVAE"" — not a common word.\n\nIt seems that having A in position 4 and E in 5 is very rare. Therefore, it\'s more likely that A is in position 1.\n\nSo, let\'s focus on words starting with A and ending with E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ABASE, ABATE, ABIDE, ABODE, ABOVE, ADOBE, AGAPE, AGATE, ALIVE, ALIKE, ALONE, AMAZE, AMBLE, AMIDE, AMINE, AMOLE, AMPLE, ANISE (but N is absent), APPLE, ARISE (R absent), etc.\n\nBut we must avoid C, R, N, S, U, T.\n\nSo:\n- ABASE: has S (absent) -> invalid.\n- ABATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.\n- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E -> B, I, D are new -> valid.\n- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> B, O, D new -> valid.\n- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> B, O, V new -> valid.\n- ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E -> D, O, B new -> valid (same as ABODE but different order).\n- AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> A repeated, but we don\'t know if A is repeated? It could be, but we only know one A is present. Also, G and P are new.\n- AGATE: has T (absent) -> invalid.\n- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E -> L, I, V new -> valid.\n- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E -> L, I, K new -> valid.\n- ALONE: A, L, O, N, E -> N is absent -> invalid.\n- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> A repeated, M, Z new -> valid, but Z is less common.\n- AMBLE: A, M, B, L, E -> M, B, L new -> valid.\n- AMIDE: A, M, I, D, E -> M, I, D new -> valid.\n- AMINE: has N -> invalid.\n- AMOLE: A, M, O, L, E -> M, O, L new -> valid.\n- AMPLE: A, M, P, L, E -> M, P, L new -> valid.\n- APPLE: A, P, P, L, E -> P repeated, and we don\'t know, but valid? But we have to avoid absent letters, and P is new.\n\nWe have many options. We want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nSince we have many positions to fill (positions 2,3,4) and we don\'t know much, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: L, I, O, D, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nA good candidate might be ""ALIVE"": tests A in position 1, and L, I, V, E (with E fixed). But V is less common.\n\n""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D.\n\n""AMBLE"": tests M, B, L.\n\n""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L.\n\nI think ""ALIVE"" is a good word because it has common letters except V, but V is worth testing.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: L, I, V are all fairly common.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to test multiple vowels. We have A and E, so testing I and O might be good.\n\nBut in ""ALIVE"", we have I.\n\nWe could do ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E. K is also common.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI think ""ABIDE"" is a solid choice because B, I, D are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that if A is not in position 1, then we will get a \'-\' for A, meaning it must be in position 4. But we already saw that position 4 is difficult, so it\'s a risk.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to test that possibility directly, but as we saw, it\'s hard to find such words without using absent letters.\n\nLet me try to find a word with A in position 4 and E in 5, without C,R,N,S,U,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLADE"" but B-L-A-D-E -> A is position 3, not 4.\n- ""GRACE"" has R and C.\n- ""SHADE"" has S and H? S is absent.\n- ""PHASE"" has S and P? S is absent.\n\nActually, I found one: ""OWARE"" — but that\'s not common, and O-W-A-R-E, R is absent.\n\nAnother: ""KNAVE"" has N and K? N absent.\n\n""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> A is position 2, not 4.\n\nIt seems very difficult. Perhaps ""ILIAD"" but that doesn\'t end with E.\n\nI think it\'s safe to assume that A is in position 1, because position 4 is rare.\n\nSo I\'ll go with a word starting with A and ending with E.\n\nNow, among the options, ""ALIVE"" is a good candidate because it tests L, I, V.\n\nBut V is less common than, say, B or D.\n\n""ABIDE"": tests B, I, D — all high frequency.\n\n""AMPLE"": tests M, P, L — also high frequency.\n\nLet me choose ""ABIDE"" for this guess.\n\nSo, guess: ABIDE\n\nBut let\'s see the positions:\n- A in position 1: if A is actually in position 1, we get a ✓, else if it\'s in position 4, we get a \'-\' (since it\'s present but not in 1).\n- Then we also get feedback on B, I, D.\n\nIf we get A correct, then we know position 1 is A, and we have _ _ _ E with A at start.\n\nIf not, then A must be in position 4.\n\nBut since position 4 is rare, we might get lucky.\n\nAlternatively, to cover more ground, we could choose a word that has A in position 4? But we can\'t find one easily.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be inefficient because we would waste a guess not testing A\'s position.\n\nSo we must include A.\n\nI think ""ABIDE"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that can test both possibilities? For example, if we put A in position 4, but we can\'t find one.\n\nPerhaps ""AGAPE"" but that has A in position 1 and 3? But position 3 we know is not A, so if we put A in position 3, we might get an \'x\' for that position, which tells us nothing new (we already know A is not in position 3). So it\'s better to avoid position 3.\n\nIn ""AGAPE"": A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). The A in position 3 will be incorrect, and we know that, so it\'s a wasted letter. So not ideal.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""ABIDE"".\n\nSo the next guess is ""abide"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is confirmed in position 5, A is present but not in position 3, and C, R, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (saute)**: E is confirmed in position 5 again, A is present but not in position 2, and S, U, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **E is fixed at position 5**: The secret word ends with E.\n2. **A must be in position 1 or 4**: A is present but not in position 2 (from saute) or 3 (from crane), and position 5 is E, so A cannot be there.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T cannot be in the word.\n4. **Word pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ _ _ E`, with A in position 1 or 4.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test A in position 1**: Since A in position 4 is rare (few common words end with ""AE""), prioritize testing A in position 1 to resolve its location efficiently.\n- **Introduce new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., B, D, I, L, M, O, P) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.\n- **Choose a word starting with A and ending with E**: This tests position 1 for A while maintaining E in position 5.\n\n**Selected word: ABIDE**  \n- A in position 1: Tests if A is in the correct starting position.\n- B, I, D: New common letters (B and D are consonants, I is a vowel) that provide broad coverage.\n- E in position 5: Confirmed correct, so it stays.\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T).\n\nIf A is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter. If not, A must be in position 4 (narrowing possibilities significantly). Feedback on B, I, and D will further refine the search.\n\n<guess>abide</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: abide -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for three guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-), specifically not position 3
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

From Guess 2 (""saute""):
- S: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-), specifically not position 2
- U: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

From Guess 3 (""abide""):
- A: correct position (✓) at position 1
- B: present but wrong position (-), specifically not position 2
- I: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 5

So, we now know:

1. The secret word is: A _ _ _ E
   - Position 1: A (confirmed)
   - Position 5: E (confirmed)

2. The letter B is in the word, but not in position 2 (since in ""abide"", B is at position 2 and we got a '-').

3. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, I, D.

4. We have used letters: A, B, C, E, I, D, R, N, S, U, T. So remaining common letters include: F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to find a word that:
- Starts with A
- Ends with E
- Has B in the word but not at position 2
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, I, D

So the word pattern is: A ? ? ? E

Where:
- The middle three positions (2,3,4) must include the letter B, but not at position 2, so B can be at position 3 or 4.
- The word must be composed of available letters (not in the absent list).

We need to choose a word that tests possible positions for B and introduces new letters.

Common words that start with A and end with E:
- ABASE, but S is absent -> invalid
- ABATE: T absent -> invalid
- ABLE: 4 letters, not 5
- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> but D is absent! D was marked absent in guess 3.
- ABORE: not common, and O? But R absent -> invalid
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> let's check: B is at position 2? In ""above"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we know B cannot be at position 2 because we got a '-' for B at position 2 in ""abide"". Therefore, if we put B at position 2 again, we know it must be wrong. So we should avoid that.

We need B not at position 2. So in ""above"", B is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So if we try it, we will get a '-' again for B? But we already know B is not at position 2. So it would be inefficient.

We must put B at position 3 or 4.

Possible words with B at position 3: A _ B _ E
Or position 4: A _ _ B E

Let's list some words:

First, B at position 3: A _ B _ E
Examples:
- ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> positions: A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This seems valid: M and L are new, and no absent letters. 
- ""ARBLE"" — not a word
- ""AUBLE"" — not common
- ""AKBLE"" — not a word

Other words: ""ALIBI"" doesn't end with E. ""AMBER"" has R -> absent.

""AMBLE"" is valid.

Now, words with B at position 4: A _ _ B E
Examples:
- ""ALIBE"" — not a word
- ""AEROBE"" — 6 letters
- ""CARBE"" — no

Actually, not many common words. ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E — but B isn't there.

Another word: ""ABUZE"" — not standard.

So it's difficult. Most words with B are going to have it in position 2 or sometimes 3.

Another word: ""AMOVE"" — not a word.

So ""AMBLE"" is a candidate: A, M, B, L, E

This puts B at position 3, which is a new position. We haven't tested position 3 for B.

We also introduce M and L, which are common letters.

Other possibilities: 
- ""AKENE"" — no B
- ""APPLE"" — no B

But we need the word to contain B? Yes, because we know B is in the word.

Another word: ""ABORE"" — A, B, O, R, E — R is absent, invalid.

""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — D is absent.

We must avoid D because D was absent in guess 3.

Therefore, ""AMBLE"" is good: A, M, B, L, E. 
- M is new
- L is new
- B is at position 3 (we haven't tested this position for B)

We can try that.

But note: we have to check if there are other options.

Another word: ""ABYE"" — 4 letters.

Or ""AMBAGE"" — 6 letters.

""AMAZE"" — A, M, A, Z, E — but we don't have B, and we know B must be included. If we use a word without B, then if B is actually in the secret word, we won't get information about it, but we know B is present. So we must include B to confirm its position.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains B.

With B at position 4: hard to find words.

Another try: ""ALBE"" — 4 letters.

""TABLE"": T is absent.

So ""AMBLE"" seems best.

Alternatively, ""ABBEY"" — ends with Y, not E.

I think ""AMBLE"" is the way to go.

So next guess: AMBLE

But let's confirm the letters: A, M, B, L, E
- Position 1: A (should be correct)
- Position 2: M (new)
- Position 3: B (we test if B is here or not) — if B is at position 3, we get a check; if not, but since B must be at position 3 or 4, if not here, then it must be at 4. And if we get a '-' for B, then it would be at position 4? No: if B is at position 4, then in this word B is at position 3, so we would get a '-' meaning B is in the word but not at position 3, so then it must be at position 4.

So we get information regardless.

Therefore, AMBLE is a good guess.

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Secret word pattern**: A _ _ _ E (A in position 1, E in position 5 confirmed).
- **Known constraints**:
  - **B is present** but not in position 2 (from ""abide"" feedback).
  - **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, U, T, I, D (ruled out).
- **Unused common letters**: F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.
- **Focus**: B must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 is invalid, and A/E occupy 1/5). The middle letters (positions 2, 3, 4) need testing.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test B in position 3**: If B is here, it would confirm the position. If not, B must be in position 4.
- **Introduce new common letters**: Use ""M"" and ""L"" to gather broader feedback and avoid wasted guesses on absent letters.
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Ensure the word doesn't reuse invalid positions or letters.

**Chosen word: AMBLE**  
- A (position 1) and E (position 5): Already confirmed correct.  
- M (position 2): New letter, tests a common consonant.  
- B (position 3): Tests if B belongs here (since it can't be in position 2).  
- L (position 4): New letter, tests a common consonant.  
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, U, T, I, D).  

This guess efficiently tests B's position while maximizing new information from M and L.

So, we now know:

1. The secret word is: A _ _ _ E
   - Position 1: A (confirmed)
   - Position 5: E (confirmed)

2. The letter B is in the word, but not in position 2 (since in ""abide"", B is at position 2 and we got a '-').

3. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, U, T, I, D.

4. We have used letters: A, B, C, E, I, D, R, N, S, U, T. So remaining common letters include: F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

- ABODE: A, B, O, D, E -> but D is absent! D was marked absent in guess 3.
- ABORE: not common, and O? But R absent -> invalid
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> let's check: B is at position 2? In ""above"": A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we know B cannot be at position 2 because we got a '-' for B at position 2 in ""abide"". Therefore, if we put B at position 2 again, we know it must be wrong. So we should avoid that.

We need B not at position 2. So in ""above"", B is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So if we try it, we will get a '-' again for B? But we already know B is not at position 2. So it would be inefficient.

We must put B at position 3 or 4.

Possible words with B at position 3: A _ B _ E
Or position 4: A _ _ B E

Let's list some words:

First, B at position 3: A _ B _ E
Examples:
- ""AMBLE"": A, M, B, L, E -> positions: A(1), M(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). This seems valid: M and L are new, and no absent letters. 
- ""ARBLE"" — not a word
- ""AUBLE"" — not common
- ""AKBLE"" — not a word

Other words: ""ALIBI"" doesn't end with E. ""AMBER"" has R -> absent.

""AMBLE"" is valid.

Now, words with B at position 4: A _ _ B E
Examples:
- ""ALIBE"" — not a word
- ""AEROBE"" — 6 letters
- ""CARBE"" — no

Actually, not many common words. ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E — but B isn't there.

Another word: ""ABUZE"" — not standard.

So it's difficult. Most words with B are going to have it in position 2 or sometimes 3.

Another word: ""AMOVE"" — not a word.

So ""AMBLE"" is a candidate: A, M, B, L, E

This puts B at position 3, which is a new position. We haven't tested position 3 for B.

We also introduce M and L, which are common letters.

Other possibilities: 
- ""AKENE"" — no B
- ""APPLE"" — no B

But we need the word to contain B? Yes, because we know B is in the word.

Another word: ""ABORE"" — A, B, O, R, E — R is absent, invalid.

""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — D is absent.

We must avoid D because D was absent in guess 3.

Therefore, ""AMBLE"" is good: A, M, B, L, E. 
- M is new
- L is new
- B is at position 3 (we haven't tested this position for B)

We can try that.

But note: we have to check if there are other options.

Another word: ""ABYE"" — 4 letters.

Or ""AMBAGE"" — 6 letters.

""AMAZE"" — A, M, A, Z, E — but we don't have B, and we know B must be included. If we use a word without B, then if B is actually in the secret word, we won't get information about it, but we know B is present. So we must include B to confirm its position.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains B.

With B at position 4: hard to find words.

Another try: ""ALBE"" — 4 letters.

""TABLE"": T is absent.

So ""AMBLE"" seems best.

Alternatively, ""ABBEY"" — ends with Y, not E.

I think ""AMBLE"" is the way to go.

So next guess: AMBLE

But let's confirm the letters: A, M, B, L, E
- Position 1: A (should be correct)
- Position 2: M (new)
- Position 3: B (we test if B is here or not) — if B is at position 3, we get a check; if not, but since B must be at position 3 or 4, if not here, then it must be at 4. And if we get a '-' for B, then it would be at position 4? No: if B is at position 4, then in this word B is at position 3, so we would get a '-' meaning B is in the word but not at position 3, so then it must be at position 4.

So we get information regardless.

Therefore, AMBLE is a good guess.### Previous Feedback Analysis:
