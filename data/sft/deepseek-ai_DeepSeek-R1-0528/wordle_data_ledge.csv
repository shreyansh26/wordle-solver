We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - 'E' is in the secret word and in the correct position. So the secret word has an 'E' as the last letter (position 5).
 - 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with 'E' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.

 Now, for the next guess, we have to:
 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with 'E' (since E is in position 5).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Notice: The word must end with E. Let's think of words ending in E.

 Common English words ending in E: 
   like, time, have, give, take, etc.

 But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).
   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.

 Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.

 Possible words ending in E that don't contain C,R,A,N:
   Let's consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let's check the letters: 
        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.

   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E's? But we don't have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn't specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.

   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.

   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that's 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.

   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.

   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.

   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

 Which of these gives maximum information?

 We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.

 Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).

 Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.

 How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.

 Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.

 So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.

 Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:

   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.
   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.
   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.

   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don't know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.

   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don't know about the rest. We also don't know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.

 Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But is there a reason to avoid M? We don't know yet.

 How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.

 Let's choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.

 My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.

 But wait, what about ""STOLE"": 
   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn't have E elsewhere? But we don't know yet.

 The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.

 But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it's in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it's okay.

 However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it's not the secret word's E, then we'll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don't prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.

 Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it's better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let's pick words that only have E at the end.

 That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don't put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that's not true: if the secret word has two E's, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as '-' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don't risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E's? But that might be a good strategy? 

 Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.

 But let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.

 This word: STOLE.

 We'll get feedback on each letter: 
   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.
   But if not, we can learn.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.

 Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.

 So avoid R.

 How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.

 Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn't end with E. We need it to end with E.

 Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.

 However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.

 Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. 

 Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.

 But I prefer covering O? We haven't tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? 

 But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.

 However, I decide: ""POISE""

 Let me try ""POISE""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).
- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.

Selected ""POISE"" because:
- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.
- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn't likely to waste positions.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - 'E' is in the secret word and in the correct position. So the secret word has an 'E' as the last letter (position 5).
 - 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with 'E' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.

 Now, for the next guess, we have to:
 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with 'E' (since E is in position 5).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Notice: The word must end with E. Let's think of words ending in E.

 Common English words ending in E: 
   like, time, have, give, take, etc.

 But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).
   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.

 Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.

 Possible words ending in E that don't contain C,R,A,N:
   Let's consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let's check the letters: 
        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.

   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E's? But we don't have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn't specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.

   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.

   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that's 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.

   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.

   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.

   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

 Which of these gives maximum information?

 We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.

 Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).

 Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.

 How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.

 Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.

 So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.

 Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:

   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.
   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.
   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.

   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don't know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.

   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don't know about the rest. We also don't know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.

 Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But is there a reason to avoid M? We don't know yet.

 How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.

 Let's choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.

 My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.

 But wait, what about ""STOLE"": 
   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn't have E elsewhere? But we don't know yet.

 The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.

 But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it's in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it's okay.

 However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it's not the secret word's E, then we'll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don't prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.

 Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it's better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let's pick words that only have E at the end.

 That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don't put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that's not true: if the secret word has two E's, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as '-' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don't risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E's? But that might be a good strategy? 

 Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.

 But let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.

 This word: STOLE.

 We'll get feedback on each letter: 
   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.
   But if not, we can learn.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.

 Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.

 So avoid R.

 How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.

 Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn't end with E. We need it to end with E.

 Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.

 However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.

 Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. 

 Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.

 But I prefer covering O? We haven't tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? 

 But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.

 However, I decide: ""POISE""

 Let me try ""POISE""

<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).
- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.

Selected ""POISE"" because:
- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.
- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn't likely to waste positions.
- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).

This guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Excluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know if there are multiple E's. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven't tested E in other positions, it's possible that E appears only once or multiple times.

But in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven't tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.

However, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.

Now, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)

But we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

However, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.

But note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E's.

Given that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let's see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.

Alternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.

But let's look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.

Common words ending in E: 
  Examples: 
    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.
    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? 
        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.

We need words ending with E.

Possible words: 
  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? 
      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). 
      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.

  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.

  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

  ""HUMVE"": not a word.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? 
      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U's? But U is allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.

  ""GUMMY"": doesn't end with E.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U's? 
      But Q is allowed? 
      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that's okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? 

  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? 

  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? 

  Let me think of more common words.

  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.

  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? 
      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.

  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.

  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? 
      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? 
      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? 
      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? 
      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? 
      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let's see: 
          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that's 5 letters? 
      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. 
      But we are avoiding excluded letters? 
          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? 
      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? 

  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. 

  After reviewing, good candidates are:
      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""

  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? 
      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.
      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).

  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don't use E, we can test 4 new letters? 

  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.

  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.

  All of these are good.

  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I'll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.

  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don't test E elsewhere, we might miss it? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let's see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn't reveal the word, we might have to test E later? 

  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E's? 

  I think it's a trade-off. Given that, I'll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? 

  So let's pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? 

  But Y is less common? 

  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? 

  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. 
      And it ends with E.

  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": 
      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? 
      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.

  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.

  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? 

  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.
  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.

  So T and H are untested.

  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".

  Guess: THYME

  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it's a herb.

  So, <guess>thyme</guess>

  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.

  Yes.

  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.

  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? 

  Frequency in English: 
      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.

  So ""THYME"" might be better.

  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? 

  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid the excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- ""THYME"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>thyme</guess>",thyme,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Excluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know if there are multiple E's. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven't tested E in other positions, it's possible that E appears only once or multiple times.

But in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven't tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.

However, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.

Now, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)

But we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

However, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.

But note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E's.

Given that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let's see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.

Alternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.

But let's look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.

Common words ending in E: 
  Examples: 
    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.
    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? 
        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.

We need words ending with E.

Possible words: 
  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? 
      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). 
      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.

  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.

  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

  ""HUMVE"": not a word.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? 
      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U's? But U is allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U's? 
      But Q is allowed? 
      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that's okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? 

  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position?

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ledge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - 'E' is in the secret word and in the correct position. So the secret word has an 'E' as the last letter (position 5).
 - 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with 'E' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.

 Now, for the next guess, we have to:
 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with 'E' (since E is in position 5).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Notice: The word must end with E. Let's think of words ending in E.

 Common English words ending in E: 
   like, time, have, give, take, etc.

 But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).
   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.

 Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.

 Possible words ending in E that don't contain C,R,A,N:
   Let's consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let's check the letters: 
        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.

   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E's? But we don't have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn't specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.

   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.

   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that's 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.

   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.

   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.

   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

 Which of these gives maximum information?

 We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.

 Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).

 Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.

 How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.

 Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.

 So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.

 Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:

   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.
   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.
   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.

   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don't know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.

   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don't know about the rest. We also don't know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.

 Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But is there a reason to avoid M? We don't know yet.

 How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.

 Let's choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.

 My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.

 But wait, what about ""STOLE"": 
   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn't have E elsewhere? But we don't know yet.

 The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.

 But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it's in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it's okay.

 However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it's not the secret word's E, then we'll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don't prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.

 Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it's better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let's pick words that only have E at the end.

 That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don't put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that's not true: if the secret word has two E's, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as '-' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don't risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E's? But that might be a good strategy? 

 Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.

 But let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.

 This word: STOLE.

 We'll get feedback on each letter: 
   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.
   But if not, we can learn.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.

 Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.

 So avoid R.

 How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.

 Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn't end with E. We need it to end with E.

 Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.

 However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.

 Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. 

 Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.

 But I prefer covering O? We haven't tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? 

 But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.

 However, I decide: ""POISE""

 Let me try ""POISE""

<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).
- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.

Selected ""POISE"" because:
- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.
- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn't likely to waste positions.
- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).

This guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>poise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Excluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know if there are multiple E's. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven't tested E in other positions, it's possible that E appears only once or multiple times.

But in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven't tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.

However, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.

Now, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)

But we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

However, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.

But note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E's.

Given that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let's see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.

Alternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.

But let's look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.

Common words ending in E: 
  Examples: 
    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.
    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? 
        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.

We need words ending with E.

Possible words: 
  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? 
      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). 
      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.

  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.

  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

  ""HUMVE"": not a word.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? 
      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U's? But U is allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.

  ""GUMMY"": doesn't end with E.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U's? 
      But Q is allowed? 
      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that's okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? 

  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? 

  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? 

  Let me think of more common words.

  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.

  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? 
      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.

  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.

  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? 
      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? 
      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? 
      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? 
      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? 
      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let's see: 
          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that's 5 letters? 
      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. 
      But we are avoiding excluded letters? 
          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? 
      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? 

  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. 

  After reviewing, good candidates are:
      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""

  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? 
      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.
      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).

  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don't use E, we can test 4 new letters? 

  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.

  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.

  All of these are good.

  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I'll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.

  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don't test E elsewhere, we might miss it? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let's see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn't reveal the word, we might have to test E later? 

  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E's? 

  I think it's a trade-off. Given that, I'll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? 

  So let's pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? 

  But Y is less common? 

  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? 

  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. 
      And it ends with E.

  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": 
      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? 
      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.

  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.

  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? 

  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.
  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.

  So T and H are untested.

  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".

  Guess: THYME

  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it's a herb.

  So, <guess>thyme</guess>

  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.

  Yes.

  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.

  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? 

  Frequency in English: 
      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.

  So ""THYME"" might be better.

  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? 

  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid the excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- ""THYME"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don\'t prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.\n\n Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it\'s better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let\'s pick words that only have E at the end.\n\n That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that\'s not true: if the secret word has two E\'s, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as \'-\' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don\'t risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E\'s? But that might be a good strategy? \n\n Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.\n\n But let me confirm: \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.\n\n This word: STOLE.\n\n We\'ll get feedback on each letter: \n   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.\n   But if not, we can learn.\n\n Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.\n\n Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.\n\n Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.\n\n So avoid R.\n\n How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.\n\n Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn\'t end with E. We need it to end with E.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.\n\n However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.\n\n Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. \n\n Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.\n\n But I prefer covering O? We haven\'t tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? \n\n But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.\n\n However, I decide: ""POISE""\n\n Let me try ""POISE""\n\n<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).\n- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (5th letter).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.\n\nSelected ""POISE"" because:\n- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.\n- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn\'t likely to waste positions.\n- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).\n\nThis guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>poise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).\n- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.\n\nWe now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.\n\nThe English alphabet: A to Z.\n\nExcluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven\'t tested E in other positions, it\'s possible that E appears only once or multiple times.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven\'t tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)\n\nBut we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nHowever, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.\n\nBut note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E\'s.\n\nGiven that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let\'s see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.\n\nCommon words ending in E: \n  Examples: \n    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.\n    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? \n        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nAnother: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\nPossible words: \n  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? \n      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). \n      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.\n\n  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.\n\n  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.\n\n  ""HUMVE"": not a word.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? \n      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U\'s? But U is allowed? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.\n\n  ""GUMMY"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U\'s? \n      But Q is allowed? \n      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). \n      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that\'s okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? \n      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? \n\n  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? \n\n  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? \n\n  Let me think of more common words.\n\n  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? \n      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEMUR"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? \n      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? \n      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? \n      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? \n      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? \n      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let\'s see: \n          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that\'s 5 letters? \n      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. \n      But we are avoiding excluded letters? \n          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. \n          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? \n      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? \n\n  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. \n\n  After reviewing, good candidates are:\n      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""\n\n  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? \n      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.\n      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).\n\n  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don\'t use E, we can test 4 new letters? \n\n  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.\n\n  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.\n\n  All of these are good.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I\'ll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.\n\n  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don\'t test E elsewhere, we might miss it? \n\n  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let\'s see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn\'t reveal the word, we might have to test E later? \n\n  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E\'s? \n\n  I think it\'s a trade-off. Given that, I\'ll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? \n\n  So let\'s pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? \n\n  But Y is less common? \n\n  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? \n\n  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. \n      And it ends with E.\n\n  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": \n      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? \n      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.\n\n  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.\n\n  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? \n\n  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.\n  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.\n\n  So T and H are untested.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".\n\n  Guess: THYME\n\n  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it\'s a herb.\n\n  So, <guess>thyme</guess>\n\n  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.\n\n  Yes.\n\n  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.\n\n  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? \n\n  Frequency in English: \n      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.\n\n  So ""THYME"" might be better.\n\n  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? \n\n  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with \'E\' and avoid the excluded letters.\n- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n- ""THYME"" is chosen because:\n  - It ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).\n  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: E is in the word at the end, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. However, we haven't tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere? But we have to consider that the feedback for E has always been correct in position 5, but if there were another E, it might have been caught? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed E in other positions.

In the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don't know if the secret word has E in other positions.

For the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)

We have 13 letters left. We need to choose 4 letters from these (plus E at the end) to form a word.

Common words ending in E with these letters:

- ""BLUFF"": doesn't end with E? Ends with F.
- ""BLUEE"": not a word.
- ""GLADE"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> but K is allowed? Let's check: K is in the remaining list? Yes. But in guess 3, we used ""thyme"" and M was absent, but K hasn't been tested? Actually, we haven't used K yet? 
  Guess 1: crane -> no K
  Guess 2: poise -> no K
  Guess 3: thyme -> no K
  So K is available. But ""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.
  However, we are using E only at the end? So we are testing F,L,U,K.

- ""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> J,U,D,G are allowed? 
      J: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

- ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> same as above? F,U,D,G,E -> valid.

- ""QUAKE"": but A excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUOTE"": O excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> but we are using E at position 3 and 5? And Q and U. 
      Q: allowed, U: allowed, E: allowed? But we are testing E at position 3? 
      This might be useful to see if there's an E at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 4, and we have 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? 
      We have 6 guesses total, so after this, 2 left? 

- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but we are using E at positions 2 and 4? And B and L. 
      B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we are using L twice? 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the secret word might have duplicates? 
      But we haven't encountered any yet? 

- ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

- ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? W,E,D,G,E -> positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
      So it ends with E? Yes. 
      Letters: W, E, D, G, E -> W, D, G are allowed? 
      W: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.
      But we are using E at position 2? So we can test if E is at position 2? 

- ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> similar, but L is allowed? 
      L: allowed -> valid.

- ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E.

- ""KEBAB"": doesn't end with E and A excluded.

- ""FJORD"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""BLUES"": B,L,U,E,S -> but S excluded -> invalid.

- ""GLOBE"": G,L,O,B,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

- ""JUICE"": I and C excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUILL"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VALUE"": V,A,L,U,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

- ""WEDGE"" we already considered.

- ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOKED"": J,O,K,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOULE"": J,O,U,L,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.

- ""LUNGE"": L,U,N,G,E -> N excluded -> invalid.

- ""MOURN"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""PURGE"": P excluded -> invalid.

- ""RANGE"": R and A excluded -> invalid.

- ""SINGE"": S and I excluded -> invalid.

- ""TUNED"": T and N excluded -> invalid.

- ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> I and P excluded -> invalid.

- ""ZEBRA"": A excluded and doesn't end with E.

So, possible words: 
  ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", ""FUDGE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE"", ""WEDGE"", ""LEDGE"", etc.

We need to choose one that gives good information.

Note: We have not tested the letter U? Actually, we haven't used U in any guess? 
  Guess1: crane -> no U
  Guess2: poise -> no U
  Guess3: thyme -> no U
So U is untested.

Similarly, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to avoid the excluded ones.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> uses Q, U, and E (twice). But it has duplicate U and E? 
  Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
  We are testing Q and U? But we are using E at position 3? 
  If we use this, we can test:
      If Q is in the word? 
      If U is in the word? 
      If E is at position 3? 
  But we are using two slots for U and two for E? So we are only testing two new letters? 

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> tests F,L,U,K -> four new letters? 
  And E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? 
  So we are testing three new letters? 

""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? 
  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? 

Therefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? 

But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters among the remaining: 
  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.

""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? 
""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? 
""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? 

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? 

Alternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? 

But we have to choose one. 

Also, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don't, we can test more new letters? 

Given that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? 

So I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.

But note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

If the secret word has an E in position 2, we won't know? But we can test that later? 

So, let's go with ""FLUKE"".

<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid all excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - Ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new untested letters: F, L, U, K (all allowed and common).
  - Avoids E in other positions to prioritize testing new letters.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- The following letters are **absent**: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"" feedback).
- The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" and use only the remaining letters.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - It tests 4 new high-frequency letters: F, L, U, K.
  - It avoids redundant letters and maximizes coverage of the remaining alphabet.
  - Common letters like F, L, and U increase the chance of hits.

<guess>fluke</guess>",fluke,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: E is in the word at the end, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. However, we haven't tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere? But we have to consider that the feedback for E has always been correct in position 5, but if there were another E, it might have been caught? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed E in other positions.

In the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don't know if the secret word has E in other positions.

For the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)

We have 13 letters left. We need to choose 4 letters from these (plus E at the end) to form a word.

Common words ending in E with these letters:

- ""BLUFF"": doesn't end with E? Ends with F.
- ""BLUEE"": not a word.
- ""GLADE"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> but K is allowed? Let's check: K is in the remaining list? Yes. But in guess 3, we used ""thyme"" and M was absent, but K hasn't been tested? Actually, we haven't used K yet? 
  Guess 1: crane -> no K
  Guess 2: poise -> no K
  Guess 3: thyme -> no K
  So K is available. But ""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.
  However, we are using E only at the end? So we are testing F,L,U,K.

- ""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> J,U,D,G are allowed? 
      J: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

- ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> same as above? F,U,D,G,E -> valid.

- ""QUAKE"": but A excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUOTE"": O excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> but we are using E at position 3 and 5? And Q and U. 
      Q: allowed, U: allowed, E: allowed? But we are testing E at position 3? 
      This might be useful to see if there's an E at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 4, and we have 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? 
      We have 6 guesses total, so after this, 2 left? 

- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but we are using E at positions 2 and 4? And B and L. 
      B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we are using L twice? 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the secret word might have duplicates? 
      But we haven't encountered any yet? 

- ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

- ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? W,E,D,G,E -> positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
      So it ends with E? Yes. 
      Letters: W, E, D, G, E -> W, D, G are allowed? 
      W: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.
      But we are using E at position 2? So we can test if E is at position 2? 

- ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> similar, but L is allowed? 
      L: allowed -> valid.

- ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E.

- ""KEBAB"": doesn't end with E and A excluded.

- ""FJORD"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""BLUES"": B,L,U,E,S -> but S excluded -> invalid.

- ""GLOBE"": G,L,O,B,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

- ""JUICE"": I and C excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUILL"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VALUE"": V,A,L,U,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

- ""WEDGE"" we already considered.

- ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOKED"": J,O,K,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOULE"": J,O,U,L,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.

- ""LUNGE"": L,U,N,G,E -> N excluded -> invalid.

- ""MOURN"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""PURGE"": P excluded -> invalid.

- ""RANGE"": R and A excluded -> invalid.

- ""SINGE"": S and I excluded -> invalid.

- ""TUNED"": T and N excluded -> invalid.

- ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> I and P excluded -> invalid.

- ""ZEBRA"": A excluded and doesn't end with E.

So, possible words: 
  ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", ""FUDGE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE"", ""WEDGE"", ""LEDGE"", etc.

We need to choose one that gives good information.

Note: We have not tested the letter U? Actually, we haven't used U in any guess? 
  Guess1: crane -> no U
  Guess2: poise -> no U
  Guess3: thyme -> no U
So U is untested.

Similarly, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to avoid the excluded ones.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> uses Q, U, and E (twice). But it has duplicate U and E? 
  Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
  We are testing Q and U? But we are using E at position 3? 
  If we use this, we can test:
      If Q is in the word? 
      If U is in the word? 
      If E is at position 3? 
  But we are using two slots for U and two for E? So we are only testing two new letters? 

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> tests F,L,U,K -> four new letters? 
  And E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? 
  So we are testing three new letters? 

""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? 
  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? 

Therefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? 

But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters among the remaining: 
  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.

""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? 
""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? 
""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? 

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? 

Alternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? 

But we have to choose one. 

Also, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don't, we can test more new letters? 

Given that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? 

So I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.

But note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

If the secret word has an E in position 2, we won't know? But we can test that later? 

So, let's go with ""FLUKE"".

<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid all excluded letters.

  - Ends with 'E' (position 5).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,ledge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - 'E' is in the secret word and in the correct position. So the secret word has an 'E' as the last letter (position 5).
 - 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with 'E' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.

 Now, for the next guess, we have to:
 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with 'E' (since E is in position 5).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Notice: The word must end with E. Let's think of words ending in E.

 Common English words ending in E: 
   like, time, have, give, take, etc.

 But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).
   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.

 Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.

 Possible words ending in E that don't contain C,R,A,N:
   Let's consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let's check the letters: 
        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.

   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E's? But we don't have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn't specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.

   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.

   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that's 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.

   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.

   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.

   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

 Which of these gives maximum information?

 We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.

 Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).

 Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.

 How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.

 Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.

 So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.

 Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:

   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.
   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.
   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.

   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don't know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.

   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don't know about the rest. We also don't know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.

 Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But is there a reason to avoid M? We don't know yet.

 How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.

 Let's choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.

 My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.

 But wait, what about ""STOLE"": 
   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn't have E elsewhere? But we don't know yet.

 The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.

 But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it's in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it's okay.

 However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it's not the secret word's E, then we'll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don't prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.

 Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it's better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let's pick words that only have E at the end.

 That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don't put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that's not true: if the secret word has two E's, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as '-' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don't risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E's? But that might be a good strategy? 

 Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.

 But let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.

 This word: STOLE.

 We'll get feedback on each letter: 
   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.
   But if not, we can learn.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.

 Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.

 So avoid R.

 How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.

 Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn't end with E. We need it to end with E.

 Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.

 However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.

 Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. 

 Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.

 But I prefer covering O? We haven't tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? 

 But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.

 However, I decide: ""POISE""

 Let me try ""POISE""

<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).
- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.

Selected ""POISE"" because:
- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.
- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn't likely to waste positions.
- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).

This guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>poise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Excluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know if there are multiple E's. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven't tested E in other positions, it's possible that E appears only once or multiple times.

But in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven't tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.

However, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.

Now, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)

But we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

However, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.

But note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E's.

Given that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let's see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.

Alternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.

But let's look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.

Common words ending in E: 
  Examples: 
    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.
    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? 
        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.

We need words ending with E.

Possible words: 
  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? 
      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). 
      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.

  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.

  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

  ""HUMVE"": not a word.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? 
      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U's? But U is allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.

  ""GUMMY"": doesn't end with E.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U's? 
      But Q is allowed? 
      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that's okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? 

  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? 

  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? 

  Let me think of more common words.

  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.

  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? 
      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.

  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.

  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? 
      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? 
      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? 
      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? 
      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? 
      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let's see: 
          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that's 5 letters? 
      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. 
      But we are avoiding excluded letters? 
          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? 
      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? 

  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. 

  After reviewing, good candidates are:
      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""

  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? 
      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.
      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).

  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don't use E, we can test 4 new letters? 

  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.

  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.

  All of these are good.

  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I'll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.

  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don't test E elsewhere, we might miss it? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let's see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn't reveal the word, we might have to test E later? 

  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E's? 

  I think it's a trade-off. Given that, I'll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? 

  So let's pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? 

  But Y is less common? 

  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? 

  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. 
      And it ends with E.

  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": 
      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? 
      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.

  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.

  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? 

  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.
  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.

  So T and H are untested.

  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".

  Guess: THYME

  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it's a herb.

  So, <guess>thyme</guess>

  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.

  Yes.

  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.

  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? 

  Frequency in English: 
      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.

  So ""THYME"" might be better.

  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? 

  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid the excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- ""THYME"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>thyme</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: E is in the word at the end, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. However, we haven't tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere? But we have to consider that the feedback for E has always been correct in position 5, but if there were another E, it might have been caught? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed E in other positions.

In the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don't know if the secret word has E in other positions.

For the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)

We have 13 letters left. We need to choose 4 letters from these (plus E at the end) to form a word.

Common words ending in E with these letters:

- ""BLUFF"": doesn't end with E? Ends with F.
- ""BLUEE"": not a word.
- ""GLADE"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> but K is allowed? Let's check: K is in the remaining list? Yes. But in guess 3, we used ""thyme"" and M was absent, but K hasn't been tested? Actually, we haven't used K yet? 
  Guess 1: crane -> no K
  Guess 2: poise -> no K
  Guess 3: thyme -> no K
  So K is available. But ""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.
  However, we are using E only at the end? So we are testing F,L,U,K.

- ""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> J,U,D,G are allowed? 
      J: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

- ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> same as above? F,U,D,G,E -> valid.

- ""QUAKE"": but A excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUOTE"": O excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> but we are using E at position 3 and 5? And Q and U. 
      Q: allowed, U: allowed, E: allowed? But we are testing E at position 3? 
      This might be useful to see if there's an E at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 4, and we have 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? 
      We have 6 guesses total, so after this, 2 left? 

- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but we are using E at positions 2 and 4? And B and L. 
      B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we are using L twice? 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the secret word might have duplicates? 
      But we haven't encountered any yet? 

- ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

- ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? W,E,D,G,E -> positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
      So it ends with E? Yes. 
      Letters: W, E, D, G, E -> W, D, G are allowed? 
      W: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.
      But we are using E at position 2? So we can test if E is at position 2? 

- ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> similar, but L is allowed? 
      L: allowed -> valid.

- ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E.

- ""KEBAB"": doesn't end with E and A excluded.

- ""FJORD"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""BLUES"": B,L,U,E,S -> but S excluded -> invalid.

- ""GLOBE"": G,L,O,B,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

- ""JUICE"": I and C excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUILL"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VALUE"": V,A,L,U,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

- ""WEDGE"" we already considered.

- ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOKED"": J,O,K,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOULE"": J,O,U,L,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.

- ""LUNGE"": L,U,N,G,E -> N excluded -> invalid.

- ""MOURN"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""PURGE"": P excluded -> invalid.

- ""RANGE"": R and A excluded -> invalid.

- ""SINGE"": S and I excluded -> invalid.

- ""TUNED"": T and N excluded -> invalid.

- ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> I and P excluded -> invalid.

- ""ZEBRA"": A excluded and doesn't end with E.

So, possible words: 
  ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", ""FUDGE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE"", ""WEDGE"", ""LEDGE"", etc.

We need to choose one that gives good information.

Note: We have not tested the letter U? Actually, we haven't used U in any guess? 
  Guess1: crane -> no U
  Guess2: poise -> no U
  Guess3: thyme -> no U
So U is untested.

Similarly, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to avoid the excluded ones.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> uses Q, U, and E (twice). But it has duplicate U and E? 
  Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
  We are testing Q and U? But we are using E at position 3? 
  If we use this, we can test:
      If Q is in the word? 
      If U is in the word? 
      If E is at position 3? 
  But we are using two slots for U and two for E? So we are only testing two new letters? 

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> tests F,L,U,K -> four new letters? 
  And E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? 
  So we are testing three new letters? 

""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? 
  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? 

Therefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? 

But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters among the remaining: 
  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.

""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? 
""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? 
""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? 

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? 

Alternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? 

But we have to choose one. 

Also, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don't, we can test more new letters? 

Given that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? 

So I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.

But note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

If the secret word has an E in position 2, we won't know? But we can test that later? 

So, let's go with ""FLUKE"".

<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid all excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - Ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new untested letters: F, L, U, K (all allowed and common).
  - Avoids E in other positions to prioritize testing new letters.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>fluke</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- The following letters are **absent**: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"" feedback).
- The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" and use only the remaining letters.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - It tests 4 new high-frequency letters: F, L, U, K.
  - It avoids redundant letters and maximizes coverage of the remaining alphabet.
  - Common letters like F, L, and U increase the chance of hits.

B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.\n\n My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n But wait, what about ""STOLE"": \n   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn\'t have E elsewhere? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.\n\n But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it\'s in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it\'s not the secret word\'s E, then we\'ll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don\'t prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.\n\n Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it\'s better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let\'s pick words that only have E at the end.\n\n That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that\'s not true: if the secret word has two E\'s, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as \'-\' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don\'t risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E\'s? But that might be a good strategy? \n\n Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.\n\n But let me confirm: \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.\n\n This word: STOLE.\n\n We\'ll get feedback on each letter: \n   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.\n   But if not, we can learn.\n\n Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.\n\n Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.\n\n Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.\n\n So avoid R.\n\n How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.\n\n Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn\'t end with E. We need it to end with E.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.\n\n However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.\n\n Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. \n\n Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.\n\n But I prefer covering O? We haven\'t tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? \n\n But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.\n\n However, I decide: ""POISE""\n\n Let me try ""POISE""\n\n<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).\n- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (5th letter).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.\n\nSelected ""POISE"" because:\n- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.\n- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn\'t likely to waste positions.\n- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).\n\nThis guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>poise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).\n- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.\n\nWe now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.\n\nThe English alphabet: A to Z.\n\nExcluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven\'t tested E in other positions, it\'s possible that E appears only once or multiple times.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven\'t tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)\n\nBut we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nHowever, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.\n\nBut note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E\'s.\n\nGiven that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let\'s see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.\n\nCommon words ending in E: \n  Examples: \n    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.\n    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? \n        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nAnother: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\nPossible words: \n  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? \n      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). \n      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.\n\n  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.\n\n  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.\n\n  ""HUMVE"": not a word.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? \n      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U\'s? But U is allowed? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.\n\n  ""GUMMY"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U\'s? \n      But Q is allowed? \n      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). \n      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that\'s okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? \n      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? \n\n  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? \n\n  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? \n\n  Let me think of more common words.\n\n  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? \n      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEMUR"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? \n      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? \n      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? \n      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? \n      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? \n      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let\'s see: \n          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that\'s 5 letters? \n      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. \n      But we are avoiding excluded letters? \n          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. \n          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? \n      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? \n\n  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. \n\n  After reviewing, good candidates are:\n      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""\n\n  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? \n      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.\n      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).\n\n  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don\'t use E, we can test 4 new letters? \n\n  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.\n\n  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.\n\n  All of these are good.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I\'ll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.\n\n  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don\'t test E elsewhere, we might miss it? \n\n  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let\'s see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn\'t reveal the word, we might have to test E later? \n\n  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E\'s? \n\n  I think it\'s a trade-off. Given that, I\'ll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? \n\n  So let\'s pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? \n\n  But Y is less common? \n\n  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? \n\n  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. \n      And it ends with E.\n\n  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": \n      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? \n      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.\n\n  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.\n\n  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? \n\n  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.\n  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.\n\n  So T and H are untested.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".\n\n  Guess: THYME\n\n  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it\'s a herb.\n\n  So, <guess>thyme</guess>\n\n  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.\n\n  Yes.\n\n  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.\n\n  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? \n\n  Frequency in English: \n      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.\n\n  So ""THYME"" might be better.\n\n  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? \n\n  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with \'E\' and avoid the excluded letters.\n- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n- ""THYME"" is chosen because:\n  - It ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).\n  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

However, we haven\'t tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere?

Not necessarily, because we haven\'t placed E in other positions.\n\nIn the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don\'t know if the secret word has E in other positions.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)\n\nWe have 13 letters left.

So we are not testing E elsewhere? \n\n""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? \n\n""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? \n\n""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? \n  So we are testing three new letters? \n\n""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? \n  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? \n\nTherefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? \n\nBut note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? \n\nCommon letters among the remaining: \n  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.\n\n""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? \n""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? \n""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? \n\nI think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? \n\nAlternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? \n\nBut we have to choose one. \n\nAlso, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don\'t, we can test more new letters? \n\nGiven that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? \n\nSo I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.\n\nBut note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? \n\nIf the secret word has an E in position 2, we won\'t know? But we can test that later? \n\nSo, let\'s go with ""FLUKE"".\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").\n- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with \'E\' and avoid all excluded letters.\n- Focus on testing new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.\n- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:\n  - Ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n  - Uses new untested letters: F, L, U, K (all allowed and common).\n  - Avoids E in other positions to prioritize testing new letters.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know:\n- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n- The following letters are **absent**: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"" feedback).\n- The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" and use only the remaining letters.\n- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:\n  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n  - It tests 4 new high-frequency letters: F, L, U, K.\n  - It avoids redundant letters and maximizes coverage of the remaining alphabet.\n  - Common letters like F, L, and U increase the chance of hits.\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: fluke -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
Meaning: 
  - E is in position 5 (correct as before).
  - F is absent (x).
  - L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - K is absent (x).

So, new information:
- The letter L is in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and got a '-', meaning wrong position).
- F, U, K are absent.

Now, updating the list of absent letters:
Absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K.

Remaining letters (from previous possible set minus these): 
Previous remaining: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
But now F, U, K are absent, so remove F, U, K.
Also, we now know L is present, so it's in the word but not in position 4.

So remaining possible letters that haven't been eliminated: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z and we know L must be included somewhere.

But L is present, and we have the position constraints: it cannot be in position 4.

Also, the word must end with E (position 5).

The secret word has exactly 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> E at position 5.

We have L present, and not at position 4.

Also, the word must contain only letters that are not in the absent set and must include L.

So possible letters: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But we haven't tested all of these? We know L is present, but the others might be present or not? No, we don't know about the others: they could be present or absent?

We know L is present. For the other letters, they are still uncertain until tested? But we have to form a word from the remaining possible letters? Not exactly: the word can contain any letter that hasn't been excluded, including L and possibly others.

But we must include L because we know it's present.

So the word must:
- End with E: position 5 = E
- Include the letter L (but not at position 4)
- Avoid: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K
- Use letters from: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z and E (but E is already at the end).

But E might also appear elsewhere? We don't know because we haven't tested E in other positions.

We are on guess 5, with two guesses left? Let me count: we have made 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.

We now know that L is in the word, so we can form words that include L.

Possible positions for L: since it's not at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

We now have to guess a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Includes L (somewhere except position 4).
- Uses only possible letters (not excluded) and E.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? Since L might be duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence.

Now, let's list the available letters: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, and L, and E (but E is fixed at the end).

We have to choose 4 letters for the first 4 positions? But one of the positions must be L? Actually, the word must have L somewhere in positions 1-3? Because position 4 cannot have L? And position 5 is E.

So positions 1,2,3,4: one of them is L? But we have to fill all positions? And the letter L must be present? Yes.

So one of positions 1,2,3 must be L? Or could L be in position 4? No, because in ""fluke"" we placed L at position 4 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. So L is not at position 4. Therefore, L must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, the word must be formed with letters from: B,D,G,J,Q,V,W,X,Z plus L and E? But E is already at the end.

Now, for the non-L positions, we must use letters from the possible set? And we cannot use excluded letters.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain L? And avoid the excluded letters.

Common words: 
  ""TABLE"": but A and B? A is excluded -> invalid.
  ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""BLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""GLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""LEGAL"": doesn't end with E -> invalid.

Possible words:

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E.
  But we are using E at position 2? We can test if E is present at position 2? 
  And L twice? 
  Also, letters: B, E, L -> B is allowed? We haven't tested B? 
  Excluded letters: we have excluded U,K, etc., but B is not excluded? 
  And E we know is at 5, but we are testing E at 2? 
  So: 
    Position 1: B (not tested yet)
    Position 2: E (tested? We know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2)
    Position 3: L (we know L is in the word)
    Position 4: L (duplicate? We don't know if duplicates allowed)
    Position 5: E (known)

  But note: we have excluded many letters? We didn't exclude B? So B is allowed? 
  However, in the word ""belle"", we have two L's and two E's? 

  ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E? Ends with Y? 
  ""JELLE"" is not a word? 

  ""VALUE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? Yes. 
    Positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
    Letters: W, E, D, G -> W, D, G haven't been tested? And E at 2.
    But what about L? We need L? This word doesn't have L? But we know the secret word has L? 
    Therefore, we must include L? So ""wedge"" doesn' t have L? So it's invalid? 

  We must include L? So the word must have L.

  Words with L? 

  How about ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. 
    But we have L at 1? We don't know where L is? 
    Letters: L, E, D, G -> D and G are allowed? 
    And we are testing L at 1? 
    But we know L is at one of the first three? Here in position 1? 
    Also, E at 2? 
    And E at 5? 
    Avoids excluded letters: yes.

  ""BELLE"": as above.

  ""BEVEL"": B,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E. 
  ""BELLE"" is the same as before? 

  ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E.

  ""GLOBE"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLUME"": P excluded -> invalid.

  ""DELLE"": is it a word? ""delle"" might not be common? 

  ""VELLE"" not common? 

  ""WELLE"" not common? 

  ""LENSE"": but N excluded -> invalid.

  ""GELLE"" not common? 

  Perhaps ""BELIE"": B,E,L,I,E -> but I excluded -> invalid.

  ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> ends with L? Not E? 

  Words ending with LE? But we need E at position 5? So words ending in LE would have L at position 4? But we cannot have L at position 4? Because in ""fluke"" we tried L at position 4 and it was wrong position? Actually, the feedback for L was '-' which means present but not in position 4? So we cannot put L at position 4? 

  Therefore, words ending in E but not LE? Or with L not at the end? 

  How about ""GLIDE"": L at 3? But I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULGE"": L at 3? But U excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUDGE"": L not present? 

  Wait, we need L? 

  So possible words: 
    Only ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"" come to mind? 

  ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

  But we have to check if G is allowed? Yes? Not excluded? 

  And D? Allowed? 

  Also, let me check if ""bedge"" is a word? Probably not? 

  Another word: ""BOLD"": not 5 letters? 

  ""DEVEL"": D,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? 

  But we need ends with E? 

  Perhaps ""ZESTE"": but we need L? Doesn't have L? 

  Maybe ""LIEGE"": L,I,E,G,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BOXLE"": not a word? 

  So limited options? 

  ""VEDGE"": V,E,D,G,E -> but no L? 

  We must have L? So words without L are invalid.

  How about ""LATKE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  So back to ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"".

  ""BELLE"": B-E-L-L-E -> has L at positions 3 and 4? But position 4 has L? But we cannot put L at position 4? Because the feedback said L is not at position 4? 

  In ""fluke"", we put L at position 4 and got '-' but '-' means the letter is in the word but wrong position? So if the secret word has L at position 4? Then it would be correct? Then it would be marked '✓'? But we got '-', meaning L is not at position 4? So the secret word has L elsewhere? But in ""BELLE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be wrong? Because the secret word doesn't have L at position 4. 

  But in ""belle"", position 4 is L? We shouldn't put L at position 4? Because it will be marked '-'? Not helpful? 

  Alternatively, we can avoid putting L at position 4? 

  So ""BELLE"" might be problematic because it forces L at position 4? 

  ""LEDGE"": L at position 1? Which is allowed? Because L can be at 1,2, or 3? 

  Also, in ""LEDGE"", we are putting L at position 1, E at position 2? 

  We haven't tested E at position 2? 

  Now, for the next guess, we can choose ""LEDGE"": 

    Positions: 
      1: L (we are testing L at position 1? But we know L is present, so we are actually just testing its position)
      2: E (testing E at position 2? Which might be present or not? Or it might be correct? But we only know E at position 5)
      3: D (new letter)
      4: G (new letter)
      5: E (known)

  So if we get:
      If L at 1: ✓ (if it's in the secret word at 1) or '-' if L is elsewhere?
      E at 2: ✓ if E is at 2? Or '-' if E is elsewhere? Or 'x' if no other E? 
      D at 3: feedback
      G at 4: feedback

  This could be informative? 

  But note: the secret word may or may not have E at position 2? 

  Alternatively, we can use a word that puts L at one of the possible positions? And avoids E elsewhere? To test other letters? 

  But we don't have many letters left? And we need to include L? And end with E.

  How about ""LABEL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEAVE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGER"": R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGAL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEVEL"": ends with L? Not E? 

  ""LIBEL"": I excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHELK"": H excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELGA"": no E ending? 

  So very few words.

  Another word: ""WELGE""? Not common? 

  ""EDGED"": ends with D? 

  ""JAGGED"": 6 letters? 

  Perhaps ""ELVER"": ends with R -> invalid? 

  ""DELVE"": ends with E -> D,E,L,V,E -> positions: D(1), E(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). 
    Letters: D,E,L,V -> D and V are allowed? 
    And L at position 3? 
    Avoids excluded letters? Yes? 
    But what about the fifth letter? Ends with E? Yes? 
    And L is at position 3? We can put L at 3? 
    Also, E at position 2? 

  So ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  Similarly, ""SELVE"" is not a common word? 

  ""SHELV"" not? 

  So ""DELVE"" is a word? Meaning a small stream? Or part of ""delve into""? 

  Acceptable? 

  ""JELAB"": not? 

  ""VELDT"": ends with T? Not E? 

  So options seem to be ""LEDGE"", ""BELLE"", ""DELVE"".

  But ""BELLE"" has L at position 4? Which we know is wrong? 

  Therefore, better to avoid ""BELLE""? 

  Between ""LEDGE"" and ""DELVE"":

  ""LEDGE"": L at 1, E at 2, D at 3, G at 4, E at 5.
  ""DELVE"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, V at 4, E at 5.

  Both have E at position 2? We need to test new letters.

  ""LEDGE"" uses L,E,D,G -> E is reused? 
  ""DELVE"" uses D,E,L,V -> E reused? 

  But they use different letters: D,G vs D,V? 
  Actually, ""LEDGE"" uses D and G? ""DELVE"" uses D and V? 

  We haven't tested D, G, V.

  In terms of coverage: ""LEDGE"" covers G? ""DELVE"" covers V? So depending on which letter we want to test? 

  But we can only pick one? 

  Also, note: position for L: 
      In ""LEDGE"", L at 1: we get feedback on position 1 for L? If it's correct, we know. If it's wrong position, we know L is at 2 or 3? 
      In ""DELVE"", L at 3: feedback at position 3.

  Since we have two guesses? Let me choose ""DELVE"": because it doesn't duplicate letters? (just D, E, L, V, E ... has E twice? but that's okay)

  But ""LEDGE"" also has E twice? 

  Alternatively, we can try to avoid E in other positions? But that might be impossible? 

  How about ""BULGED""? 6 letters.

  ""LUNGE"": N excluded -> invalid.

  ""LARGE"": A and R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LOWED"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLIED"": P excluded -> invalid.

  So I think ""DELVE"" or ""LEDGE"" are the two options? 

  Let me pick ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  We choose ""DELVE"".

<guess>delve</guess>
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Letters **absent**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, Y (from all feedback).
- **Known presence**: L is in the word but not in position 4 (per ""fluke"" feedback showing L as ""-"").
- Available letters to use: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (and E at position 5).

For this guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" (position 5), include ""L"" (but not at position 4), and avoid all excluded letters.
- ""DELVE"" (D-E-L-V-E) is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - Includes ""L"" in position 3 (a new position not yet tested).
  - Tests new letters: D, V (untested), while confirming L and E positions.
  - Avoids known absent letters and focuses on resolving L's position and introducing high-potential consonants.

<guess>delve</guess>",delve,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
Meaning: 
  - E is in position 5 (correct as before).
  - F is absent (x).
  - L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - K is absent (x).

So, new information:
- The letter L is in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and got a '-', meaning wrong position).
- F, U, K are absent.

Now, updating the list of absent letters:
Absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K.

Remaining letters (from previous possible set minus these): 
Previous remaining: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
But now F, U, K are absent, so remove F, U, K.
Also, we now know L is present, so it's in the word but not in position 4.

So remaining possible letters that haven't been eliminated: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z and we know L must be included somewhere.

But L is present, and we have the position constraints: it cannot be in position 4.

Also, the word must end with E (position 5).

The secret word has exactly 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> E at position 5.

We have L present, and not at position 4.

Also, the word must contain only letters that are not in the absent set and must include L.

So possible letters: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But we haven't tested all of these? We know L is present, but the others might be present or not? No, we don't know about the others: they could be present or absent?

We know L is present. For the other letters, they are still uncertain until tested? But we have to form a word from the remaining possible letters? Not exactly: the word can contain any letter that hasn't been excluded, including L and possibly others.

But we must include L because we know it's present.

So the word must:
- End with E: position 5 = E
- Include the letter L (but not at position 4)
- Avoid: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K
- Use letters from: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z and E (but E is already at the end).

But E might also appear elsewhere? We don't know because we haven't tested E in other positions.

We are on guess 5, with two guesses left? Let me count: we have made 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.

We now know that L is in the word, so we can form words that include L.

Possible positions for L: since it's not at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

We now have to guess a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Includes L (somewhere except position 4).
- Uses only possible letters (not excluded) and E.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? Since L might be duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence.

Now, let's list the available letters: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, and L, and E (but E is fixed at the end).

We have to choose 4 letters for the first 4 positions? But one of the positions must be L? Actually, the word must have L somewhere in positions 1-3? Because position 4 cannot have L? And position 5 is E.

So positions 1,2,3,4: one of them is L? But we have to fill all positions? And the letter L must be present? Yes.

So one of positions 1,2,3 must be L? Or could L be in position 4? No, because in ""fluke"" we placed L at position 4 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. So L is not at position 4. Therefore, L must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, the word must be formed with letters from: B,D,G,J,Q,V,W,X,Z plus L and E? But E is already at the end.

Now, for the non-L positions, we must use letters from the possible set? And we cannot use excluded letters.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain L? And avoid the excluded letters.

Common words: 
  ""TABLE"": but A and B? A is excluded -> invalid.
  ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""BLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""GLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""LEGAL"": doesn't end with E -> invalid.

Possible words:

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E.
  But we are using E at position 2? We can test if E is present at position 2? 
  And L twice? 
  Also, letters: B, E, L -> B is allowed? We haven't tested B? 
  Excluded letters: we have excluded U,K, etc., but B is not excluded? 
  And E we know is at 5, but we are testing E at 2? 
  So: 
    Position 1: B (not tested yet)
    Position 2: E (tested? We know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2)
    Position 3: L (we know L is in the word)
    Position 4: L (duplicate? We don't know if duplicates allowed)
    Position 5: E (known)

  But note: we have excluded many letters? We didn't exclude B? So B is allowed? 
  However, in the word ""belle"", we have two L's and two E's? 

  ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E? Ends with Y? 
  ""JELLE"" is not a word? 

  ""VALUE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? Yes. 
    Positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
    Letters: W, E, D, G -> W, D, G haven't been tested? And E at 2.
    But what about L? We need L? This word doesn't have L? But we know the secret word has L? 
    Therefore, we must include L? So ""wedge"" doesn' t have L? So it's invalid? 

  We must include L? So the word must have L.

  Words with L? 

  How about ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. 
    But we have L at 1? We don't know where L is? 
    Letters: L, E, D, G -> D and G are allowed? 
    And we are testing L at 1? 
    But we know L is at one of the first three? Here in position 1? 
    Also, E at 2? 
    And E at 5? 
    Avoids excluded letters: yes.

  ""BELLE"": as above.

  ""BEVEL"": B,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E. 
  ""BELLE"" is the same as before? 

  ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E.

  ""GLOBE"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLUME"": P excluded -> invalid.

  ""DELLE"": is it a word? ""delle"" might not be common? 

  ""VELLE"" not common? 

  ""WELLE"" not common? 

  ""LENSE"": but N excluded -> invalid.

  ""GELLE"" not common? 

  Perhaps ""BELIE"": B,E,L,I,E -> but I excluded -> invalid.

  ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> ends with L? Not E? 

  Words ending with LE? But we need E at position 5? So words ending in LE would have L at position 4? But we cannot have L at position 4? Because in ""fluke"" we tried L at position 4 and it was wrong position? Actually, the feedback for L was '-' which means present but not in position 4? So we cannot put L at position 4? 

  Therefore, words ending in E but not LE? Or with L not at the end? 

  How about ""GLIDE"": L at 3? But I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULGE"": L at 3? But U excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUDGE"": L not present? 

  Wait, we need L? 

  So possible words: 
    Only ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"" come to mind? 

  ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

  But we have to check if G is allowed? Yes? Not excluded? 

  And D? Allowed? 

  Also, let me check if ""bedge"" is a word? Probably not? 

  Another word: ""BOLD"": not 5 letters? 

  ""DEVEL"": D,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? 

  But we need ends with E? 

  Perhaps ""ZESTE"": but we need L? Doesn't have L? 

  Maybe ""LIEGE"": L,I,E,G,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BOXLE"": not a word? 

  So limited options? 

  ""VEDGE"": V,E,D,G,E -> but no L? 

  We must have L? So words without L are invalid.

  How about ""LATKE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  So back to ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"".

  ""BELLE"": B-E-L-L-E -> has L at positions 3 and 4? But position 4 has L? But we cannot put L at position 4? Because the feedback said L is not at position 4? 

  In ""fluke"", we put L at position 4 and got '-' but '-' means the letter is in the word but wrong position? So if the secret word has L at position 4? Then it would be correct? Then it would be marked '✓'? But we got '-', meaning L is not at position 4? So the secret word has L elsewhere? But in ""BELLE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be wrong? Because the secret word doesn't have L at position 4. 

  But in ""belle"", position 4 is L? We shouldn't put L at position 4? Because it will be marked '-'? Not helpful? 

  Alternatively, we can avoid putting L at position 4? 

  So ""BELLE"" might be problematic because it forces L at position 4? 

  ""LEDGE"": L at position 1? Which is allowed? Because L can be at 1,2, or 3? 

  Also, in ""LEDGE"", we are putting L at position 1, E at position 2? 

  We haven't tested E at position 2? 

  Now, for the next guess, we can choose ""LEDGE"": 

    Positions: 
      1: L (we are testing L at position 1? But we know L is present, so we are actually just testing its position)
      2: E (testing E at position 2? Which might be present or not? Or it might be correct? But we only know E at position 5)
      3: D (new letter)
      4: G (new letter)
      5: E (known)

  So if we get:
      If L at 1: ✓ (if it's in the secret word at 1) or '-' if L is elsewhere?
      E at 2: ✓ if E is at 2? Or '-' if E is elsewhere? Or 'x' if no other E? 
      D at 3: feedback
      G at 4: feedback

  This could be informative? 

  But note: the secret word may or may not have E at position 2? 

  Alternatively, we can use a word that puts L at one of the possible positions? And avoids E elsewhere? To test other letters? 

  But we don't have many letters left? And we need to include L? And end with E.

  How about ""LABEL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEAVE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGER"": R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGAL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEVEL"": ends with L? Not E? 

  ""LIBEL"": I excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHELK"": H excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELGA"": no E ending? 

  So very few words.

  Another word: ""WELGE""? Not common? 

  ""EDGED"": ends with D? 

  ""JAGGED"": 6 letters? 

  Perhaps ""ELVER"": ends with R -> invalid? 

  ""DELVE"": ends with E -> D,E,L,V,E -> positions: D(1), E(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). 
    Letters: D,E,L,V -> D and V are allowed? 
    And L at position 3? 
    Avoids excluded letters? Yes? 
    But what about the fifth letter? Ends with E? Yes? 
    And L is at position 3? We can put L at 3? 
    Also, E at position 2? 

  So ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  Similarly, ""SELVE"" is not a common word? 

  ""SHELV"" not? 

  So ""DELVE"" is a word? Meaning a small stream? Or part of ""delve into""? 

  Acceptable? 

  ""JELAB"": not? 

  ""VELDT"": ends with T? Not E? 

  So options seem to be ""LEDGE"", ""BELLE"", ""DELVE"".

  But ""BELLE"" has L at position 4? Which we know is wrong? 

  Therefore, better to avoid ""BELLE""? 

  Between ""LEDGE"" and ""DELVE"":

  ""LEDGE"": L at 1, E at 2, D at 3, G at 4, E at 5.
  ""DELVE"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, V at 4, E at 5.

  Both have E at position 2? We need to test new letters.

  ""LEDGE"" uses L,E,D,G -> E is reused? 
  ""DELVE"" uses D,E,L,V -> E reused? 

  But they use different letters: D,G vs D,V? 
  Actually, ""LEDGE"" uses D and G? ""DELVE"" uses D and V? 

  We haven't tested D, G, V.

  In terms of coverage: ""LEDGE"" covers G? ""DELVE"" covers V? So depending on which letter we want to test? 

  But we can only pick one? 

  Also, note: position for L: 
      In ""LEDGE"", L at 1: we get feedback on position 1 for L? If it's correct, we know. If it's wrong position, we know L is at 2 or 3? 
      In ""DELVE"", L at 3: feedback at position 3.

  Since we have two guesses? Let me choose ""DELVE"": because it doesn't duplicate letters? (just D, E, L, V, E ... has E twice? but that's okay)

  But ""LEDGE"" also has E twice? 

  Alternatively, we can try to avoid E in other positions? But that might be impossible? 

  How about ""BULGED""? 6 letters.

  ""LUNGE"": N excluded -> invalid.

  ""LARGE"": A and R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LOWED"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLIED"": P excluded -> invalid.

  So I think ""DELVE"" or ""LEDGE"" are the two options? 

  Let me pick ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  We choose ""DELVE"".

<guess>delve</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Letters **absent**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, Y (from all feedback).
- **Known presence**: L is in the word but not in position 4 (per ""fluke"" feedback showing L as ""-"").
- Available letters to use: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (and E at position 5).

For this guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" (position 5), include ""L"" (but not at position 4), and avoid all excluded letters.
- ""DELVE"" (D-E-L-V-E) is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - Includes ""L"" in position 3 (a new position not yet tested).
  - Tests new letters: D, V (untested), while confirming L and E positions.
  - Avoids known absent letters and focuses on resolving L's position and introducing high-potential consonants.",Guess 5: delve -> FEEDBACK: D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,ledge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 Interpretation:
 - 'E' is in the secret word and in the correct position. So the secret word has an 'E' as the last letter (position 5).
 - 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N' are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word ends with 'E' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.

 Now, for the next guess, we have to:
 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with 'E' (since E is in position 5).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.

 We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.

 Notice: The word must end with E. Let's think of words ending in E.

 Common English words ending in E: 
   like, time, have, give, take, etc.

 But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).
   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.

 Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.

 Possible words ending in E that don't contain C,R,A,N:
   Let's consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let's check the letters: 
        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.

   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E's? But we don't have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn't show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn't specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.

   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.

   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that's 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.

   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.

   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.

   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.

 Which of these gives maximum information?

 We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.

 Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).

 Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.

 How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.

 Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.

 So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.

 Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:

   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.
   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.
   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.
   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.

   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don't know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.

   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don't know about the rest. We also don't know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.

 Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.

 But is there a reason to avoid M? We don't know yet.

 How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.

 Let's choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.

 My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.

 But wait, what about ""STOLE"": 
   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

 However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn't have E elsewhere? But we don't know yet.

 The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.

 But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it's in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it's okay.

 However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it's not the secret word's E, then we'll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don't prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.

 Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it's better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let's pick words that only have E at the end.

 That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don't put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that's not true: if the secret word has two E's, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as '-' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don't risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E's? But that might be a good strategy? 

 Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.

 But let me confirm: 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.

 This word: STOLE.

 We'll get feedback on each letter: 
   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.
   But if not, we can learn.

 Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.

 Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.

 So avoid R.

 How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.

 Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn't end with E. We need it to end with E.

 Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.

 However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.

 Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. 

 Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.

 But I prefer covering O? We haven't tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? 

 But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.

 However, I decide: ""POISE""

 Let me try ""POISE""

<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).
- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (5th letter).
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.
- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.

Selected ""POISE"" because:
- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.
- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn't likely to waste positions.
- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).

This guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>poise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.

The English alphabet: A to Z.

Excluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know if there are multiple E's. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven't tested E in other positions, it's possible that E appears only once or multiple times.

But in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven't tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.

However, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.

Now, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)

But we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

However, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.

But note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E's.

Given that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let's see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.

Alternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.

But let's look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.

Common words ending in E: 
  Examples: 
    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.
    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.
    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? 
        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

Another: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.

We need words ending with E.

Possible words: 
  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? 
      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). 
      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.

  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.

  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.

  ""HUMVE"": not a word.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? 
      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.

  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U's? But U is allowed? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any yet. Also, ""fugue"" is a word.

  ""GUMMY"": doesn't end with E.

  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U's? 
      But Q is allowed? 
      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that's okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? 

  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? 

  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? 

  Let me think of more common words.

  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.

  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.

  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? 
      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.

  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.

  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times? And L twice? 
      But P is not used? However, we have to avoid excluded letters: B,E,L are allowed? 
      But E is allowed? However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? 
      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? 
      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? 
      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let's see: 
          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that's 5 letters? 
      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. 
      But we are avoiding excluded letters? 
          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? 
      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? 

  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. 

  After reviewing, good candidates are:
      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""

  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? 
      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.
      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).

  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don't use E, we can test 4 new letters? 

  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.

  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.

  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.

  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.

  All of these are good.

  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I'll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.

  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don't test E elsewhere, we might miss it? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let's see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn't reveal the word, we might have to test E later? 

  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E's? 

  I think it's a trade-off. Given that, I'll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? 

  So let's pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? 

  But Y is less common? 

  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? 

  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. 
      And it ends with E.

  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": 
      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? 
      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.

  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.

  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? 

  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.
  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.

  So T and H are untested.

  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".

  Guess: THYME

  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it's a herb.

  So, <guess>thyme</guess>

  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.

  Yes.

  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.

  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? 

  Frequency in English: 
      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.

  So ""THYME"" might be better.

  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? 

  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid the excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- ""THYME"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>thyme</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- The following letters are absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

We now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E

And the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: E is in the word at the end, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. However, we haven't tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere? But we have to consider that the feedback for E has always been correct in position 5, but if there were another E, it might have been caught? Not necessarily, because we haven't placed E in other positions.

In the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don't know if the secret word has E in other positions.

For the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5)
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)

We have 13 letters left. We need to choose 4 letters from these (plus E at the end) to form a word.

Common words ending in E with these letters:

- ""BLUFF"": doesn't end with E? Ends with F.
- ""BLUEE"": not a word.
- ""GLADE"": but A is excluded -> invalid.
- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> but K is allowed? Let's check: K is in the remaining list? Yes. But in guess 3, we used ""thyme"" and M was absent, but K hasn't been tested? Actually, we haven't used K yet? 
  Guess 1: crane -> no K
  Guess 2: poise -> no K
  Guess 3: thyme -> no K
  So K is available. But ""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K,E -> all allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.
  However, we are using E only at the end? So we are testing F,L,U,K.

- ""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> J,U,D,G are allowed? 
      J: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.

- ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> same as above? F,U,D,G,E -> valid.

- ""QUAKE"": but A excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUOTE"": O excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> but we are using E at position 3 and 5? And Q and U. 
      Q: allowed, U: allowed, E: allowed? But we are testing E at position 3? 
      This might be useful to see if there's an E at position 3? 
      But we are on guess 4, and we have 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? 
      We have 6 guesses total, so after this, 2 left? 

- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but we are using E at positions 2 and 4? And B and L. 
      B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we are using L twice? 
      However, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the secret word might have duplicates? 
      But we haven't encountered any yet? 

- ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

- ""LEMUR"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? W,E,D,G,E -> positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
      So it ends with E? Yes. 
      Letters: W, E, D, G, E -> W, D, G are allowed? 
      W: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.
      But we are using E at position 2? So we can test if E is at position 2? 

- ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> similar, but L is allowed? 
      L: allowed -> valid.

- ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E.

- ""KEBAB"": doesn't end with E and A excluded.

- ""FJORD"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.

- ""BLUES"": B,L,U,E,S -> but S excluded -> invalid.

- ""GLOBE"": G,L,O,B,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

- ""JUICE"": I and C excluded -> invalid.

- ""QUILL"": doesn't end with E.

- ""VALUE"": V,A,L,U,E -> A excluded -> invalid.

- ""WEDGE"" we already considered.

- ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOKED"": J,O,K,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""JOULE"": J,O,U,L,E -> O excluded -> invalid.

- ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.

- ""LUNGE"": L,U,N,G,E -> N excluded -> invalid.

- ""MOURN"": doesn't end with E and O excluded.

- ""PURGE"": P excluded -> invalid.

- ""RANGE"": R and A excluded -> invalid.

- ""SINGE"": S and I excluded -> invalid.

- ""TUNED"": T and N excluded -> invalid.

- ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> I and P excluded -> invalid.

- ""ZEBRA"": A excluded and doesn't end with E.

So, possible words: 
  ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", ""FUDGE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE"", ""WEDGE"", ""LEDGE"", etc.

We need to choose one that gives good information.

Note: We have not tested the letter U? Actually, we haven't used U in any guess? 
  Guess1: crane -> no U
  Guess2: poise -> no U
  Guess3: thyme -> no U
So U is untested.

Similarly, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But we have to avoid the excluded ones.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible? 

""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> uses Q, U, and E (twice). But it has duplicate U and E? 
  Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). 
  We are testing Q and U? But we are using E at position 3? 
  If we use this, we can test:
      If Q is in the word? 
      If U is in the word? 
      If E is at position 3? 
  But we are using two slots for U and two for E? So we are only testing two new letters? 

""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> tests F,L,U,K -> four new letters? 
  And E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? 

""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? 
  So we are testing three new letters? 

""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? 
  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? 

Therefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? 

But note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters among the remaining: 
  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.

""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? 
""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? 
""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? 

I think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? 

Alternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? 

But we have to choose one. 

Also, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don't, we can test more new letters? 

Given that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? 

So I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.

But note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? 

If the secret word has an E in position 2, we won't know? But we can test that later? 

So, let's go with ""FLUKE"".

<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word ends with 'E' (position 5).
- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with 'E' and avoid all excluded letters.
- Focus on testing new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - Ends with 'E' (position 5).
  - Uses new untested letters: F, L, U, K (all allowed and common).
  - Avoids E in other positions to prioritize testing new letters.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>fluke</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- The following letters are **absent**: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"" feedback).
- The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" and use only the remaining letters.
- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - It tests 4 new high-frequency letters: F, L, U, K.
  - It avoids redundant letters and maximizes coverage of the remaining alphabet.
  - Common letters like F, L, and U increase the chance of hits.

<guess>fluke</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: fluke -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. P, O, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.

Guess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
Meaning: 
  - E is in position 5 (correct as before).
  - F is absent (x).
  - L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - K is absent (x).

So, new information:
- The letter L is in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and got a '-', meaning wrong position).
- F, U, K are absent.

Now, updating the list of absent letters:
Absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K.

Remaining letters (from previous possible set minus these): 
Previous remaining: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
But now F, U, K are absent, so remove F, U, K.
Also, we now know L is present, so it's in the word but not in position 4.

So remaining possible letters that haven't been eliminated: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z and we know L must be included somewhere.

But L is present, and we have the position constraints: it cannot be in position 4.

Also, the word must end with E (position 5).

The secret word has exactly 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> E at position 5.

We have L present, and not at position 4.

Also, the word must contain only letters that are not in the absent set and must include L.

So possible letters: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But we haven't tested all of these? We know L is present, but the others might be present or not? No, we don't know about the others: they could be present or absent?

We know L is present. For the other letters, they are still uncertain until tested? But we have to form a word from the remaining possible letters? Not exactly: the word can contain any letter that hasn't been excluded, including L and possibly others.

But we must include L because we know it's present.

So the word must:
- End with E: position 5 = E
- Include the letter L (but not at position 4)
- Avoid: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K
- Use letters from: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z and E (but E is already at the end).

But E might also appear elsewhere? We don't know because we haven't tested E in other positions.

We are on guess 5, with two guesses left? Let me count: we have made 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.

We now know that L is in the word, so we can form words that include L.

Possible positions for L: since it's not at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

We now have to guess a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Includes L (somewhere except position 4).
- Uses only possible letters (not excluded) and E.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? Since L might be duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence.

Now, let's list the available letters: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, and L, and E (but E is fixed at the end).

We have to choose 4 letters for the first 4 positions? But one of the positions must be L? Actually, the word must have L somewhere in positions 1-3? Because position 4 cannot have L? And position 5 is E.

So positions 1,2,3,4: one of them is L? But we have to fill all positions? And the letter L must be present? Yes.

So one of positions 1,2,3 must be L? Or could L be in position 4? No, because in ""fluke"" we placed L at position 4 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. So L is not at position 4. Therefore, L must be at position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, the word must be formed with letters from: B,D,G,J,Q,V,W,X,Z plus L and E? But E is already at the end.

Now, for the non-L positions, we must use letters from the possible set? And we cannot use excluded letters.

Let's think of words ending with E that contain L? And avoid the excluded letters.

Common words: 
  ""TABLE"": but A and B? A is excluded -> invalid.
  ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""BLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""GLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.
  ""LEGAL"": doesn't end with E -> invalid.

Possible words:

  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E.
  But we are using E at position 2? We can test if E is present at position 2? 
  And L twice? 
  Also, letters: B, E, L -> B is allowed? We haven't tested B? 
  Excluded letters: we have excluded U,K, etc., but B is not excluded? 
  And E we know is at 5, but we are testing E at 2? 
  So: 
    Position 1: B (not tested yet)
    Position 2: E (tested? We know E is at 5, but we don't know about position 2)
    Position 3: L (we know L is in the word)
    Position 4: L (duplicate? We don't know if duplicates allowed)
    Position 5: E (known)

  But note: we have excluded many letters? We didn't exclude B? So B is allowed? 
  However, in the word ""belle"", we have two L's and two E's? 

  ""JELLY"": doesn't end with E? Ends with Y? 
  ""JELLE"" is not a word? 

  ""VALUE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? Yes. 
    Positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 
    Letters: W, E, D, G -> W, D, G haven't been tested? And E at 2.
    But what about L? We need L? This word doesn't have L? But we know the secret word has L? 
    Therefore, we must include L? So ""wedge"" doesn' t have L? So it's invalid? 

  We must include L? So the word must have L.

  Words with L? 

  How about ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. 
    But we have L at 1? We don't know where L is? 
    Letters: L, E, D, G -> D and G are allowed? 
    And we are testing L at 1? 
    But we know L is at one of the first three? Here in position 1? 
    Also, E at 2? 
    And E at 5? 
    Avoids excluded letters: yes.

  ""BELLE"": as above.

  ""BEVEL"": B,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E. 
  ""BELLE"" is the same as before? 

  ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E.

  ""GLOBE"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLUME"": P excluded -> invalid.

  ""DELLE"": is it a word? ""delle"" might not be common? 

  ""VELLE"" not common? 

  ""WELLE"" not common? 

  ""LENSE"": but N excluded -> invalid.

  ""GELLE"" not common? 

  Perhaps ""BELIE"": B,E,L,I,E -> but I excluded -> invalid.

  ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> ends with L? Not E? 

  Words ending with LE? But we need E at position 5? So words ending in LE would have L at position 4? But we cannot have L at position 4? Because in ""fluke"" we tried L at position 4 and it was wrong position? Actually, the feedback for L was '-' which means present but not in position 4? So we cannot put L at position 4? 

  Therefore, words ending in E but not LE? Or with L not at the end? 

  How about ""GLIDE"": L at 3? But I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULGE"": L at 3? But U excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUDGE"": L not present? 

  Wait, we need L? 

  So possible words: 
    Only ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"" come to mind? 

  ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.

  But we have to check if G is allowed? Yes? Not excluded? 

  And D? Allowed? 

  Also, let me check if ""bedge"" is a word? Probably not? 

  Another word: ""BOLD"": not 5 letters? 

  ""DEVEL"": D,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? 

  But we need ends with E? 

  Perhaps ""ZESTE"": but we need L? Doesn't have L? 

  Maybe ""LIEGE"": L,I,E,G,E -> I excluded -> invalid.

  ""BOXLE"": not a word? 

  So limited options? 

  ""VEDGE"": V,E,D,G,E -> but no L? 

  We must have L? So words without L are invalid.

  How about ""LATKE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  So back to ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"".

  ""BELLE"": B-E-L-L-E -> has L at positions 3 and 4? But position 4 has L? But we cannot put L at position 4? Because the feedback said L is not at position 4? 

  In ""fluke"", we put L at position 4 and got '-' but '-' means the letter is in the word but wrong position? So if the secret word has L at position 4? Then it would be correct? Then it would be marked '✓'? But we got '-', meaning L is not at position 4? So the secret word has L elsewhere? But in ""BELLE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be wrong? Because the secret word doesn't have L at position 4. 

  But in ""belle"", position 4 is L? We shouldn't put L at position 4? Because it will be marked '-'? Not helpful? 

  Alternatively, we can avoid putting L at position 4? 

  So ""BELLE"" might be problematic because it forces L at position 4? 

  ""LEDGE"": L at position 1? Which is allowed? Because L can be at 1,2, or 3? 

  Also, in ""LEDGE"", we are putting L at position 1, E at position 2? 

  We haven't tested E at position 2? 

  Now, for the next guess, we can choose ""LEDGE"": 

    Positions: 
      1: L (we are testing L at position 1? But we know L is present, so we are actually just testing its position)
      2: E (testing E at position 2? Which might be present or not? Or it might be correct? But we only know E at position 5)
      3: D (new letter)
      4: G (new letter)
      5: E (known)

  So if we get:
      If L at 1: ✓ (if it's in the secret word at 1) or '-' if L is elsewhere?
      E at 2: ✓ if E is at 2? Or '-' if E is elsewhere? Or 'x' if no other E? 
      D at 3: feedback
      G at 4: feedback

  This could be informative? 

  But note: the secret word may or may not have E at position 2? 

  Alternatively, we can use a word that puts L at one of the possible positions? And avoids E elsewhere? To test other letters? 

  But we don't have many letters left? And we need to include L? And end with E.

  How about ""LABEL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEAVE"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGER"": R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEGAL"": A excluded -> invalid.

  ""LEVEL"": ends with L? Not E? 

  ""LIBEL"": I excluded -> invalid.

  ""WHELK"": H excluded -> invalid.

  ""BELGA"": no E ending? 

  So very few words.

  Another word: ""WELGE""? Not common? 

  ""EDGED"": ends with D? 

  ""JAGGED"": 6 letters? 

  Perhaps ""ELVER"": ends with R -> invalid? 

  ""DELVE"": ends with E -> D,E,L,V,E -> positions: D(1), E(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). 
    Letters: D,E,L,V -> D and V are allowed? 
    And L at position 3? 
    Avoids excluded letters? Yes? 
    But what about the fifth letter? Ends with E? Yes? 
    And L is at position 3? We can put L at 3? 
    Also, E at position 2? 

  So ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  Similarly, ""SELVE"" is not a common word? 

  ""SHELV"" not? 

  So ""DELVE"" is a word? Meaning a small stream? Or part of ""delve into""? 

  Acceptable? 

  ""JELAB"": not? 

  ""VELDT"": ends with T? Not E? 

  So options seem to be ""LEDGE"", ""BELLE"", ""DELVE"".

  But ""BELLE"" has L at position 4? Which we know is wrong? 

  Therefore, better to avoid ""BELLE""? 

  Between ""LEDGE"" and ""DELVE"":

  ""LEDGE"": L at 1, E at 2, D at 3, G at 4, E at 5.
  ""DELVE"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, V at 4, E at 5.

  Both have E at position 2? We need to test new letters.

  ""LEDGE"" uses L,E,D,G -> E is reused? 
  ""DELVE"" uses D,E,L,V -> E reused? 

  But they use different letters: D,G vs D,V? 
  Actually, ""LEDGE"" uses D and G? ""DELVE"" uses D and V? 

  We haven't tested D, G, V.

  In terms of coverage: ""LEDGE"" covers G? ""DELVE"" covers V? So depending on which letter we want to test? 

  But we can only pick one? 

  Also, note: position for L: 
      In ""LEDGE"", L at 1: we get feedback on position 1 for L? If it's correct, we know. If it's wrong position, we know L is at 2 or 3? 
      In ""DELVE"", L at 3: feedback at position 3.

  Since we have two guesses? Let me choose ""DELVE"": because it doesn't duplicate letters? (just D, E, L, V, E ... has E twice? but that's okay)

  But ""LEDGE"" also has E twice? 

  Alternatively, we can try to avoid E in other positions? But that might be impossible? 

  How about ""BULGED""? 6 letters.

  ""LUNGE"": N excluded -> invalid.

  ""LARGE"": A and R excluded -> invalid.

  ""LOWED"": O excluded -> invalid.

  ""PLIED"": P excluded -> invalid.

  So I think ""DELVE"" or ""LEDGE"" are the two options? 

  Let me pick ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.

  We choose ""DELVE"".

<guess>delve</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback:
- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Letters **absent**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, Y (from all feedback).
- **Known presence**: L is in the word but not in position 4 (per ""fluke"" feedback showing L as ""-"").
- Available letters to use: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (and E at position 5).

For this guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" (position 5), include ""L"" (but not at position 4), and avoid all excluded letters.
- ""DELVE"" (D-E-L-V-E) is chosen because:
  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).
  - Includes ""L"" in position 3 (a new position not yet tested).
  - Tests new letters: D, V (untested), while confirming L and E positions.
  - Avoids known absent letters and focuses on resolving L's position and introducing high-potential consonants.

So the secret word has an \'E\' as the last letter (position 5).\n - \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\' are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word ends with \'E\' and does not contain the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n Now, for the next guess, we have to:\n 1. Use a 5-letter word ending with \'E\' (since E is in position 5).\n 2. Avoid using the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n We can also try to include other common vowels and consonants to gather more information.\n\n Notice: The word must end with E. Let\'s think of words ending in E.\n\n Common English words ending in E: \n   like, time, have, give, take, etc.\n\n But we have restrictions: we must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words that fit:\n   We can try a word such as ""SLATE"", but A is in ""slate"" and we know A is not in the word (from feedback, A(x) meaning not present).\n   Similarly, ""STORE"" has R? But R is not allowed? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is not present. So avoid R.\n\n Since A and R are out, we avoid words containing these letters.\n\n Possible words ending in E that don\'t contain C,R,A,N:\n   Let\'s consider vowels: We still have U, I, O. And consonants except C,R,A,N.\n\n Examples: \n   ""QUOTE"": has Q,U,O,T,E -> but Q and U are less common? Maybe, but let\'s check the letters: \n        Would that leave us with information? However, note that E is confirmed at the end.\n\n   ""PIECE"": contains P,I,E,C? But C is excluded -> ""piece"" has C? Actually P,I,E,C,E -> wait, it has two E\'s? But we don\'t have information on if the word allows duplicates? But our feedback for the first guess didn\'t show duplicates. However, the secret word could have duplicates? But the rules didn\'t specify so I assume it might. But the problem is we must avoid C.\n\n   Let me avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   Another word: ""POINTE"" - but that\'s 6 letters? Not 5. We need 5-letter words.\n\n   ""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. But that has S and I which are common.\n\n   ""STYLE"": S,T,Y,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N. This has S,T,Y,L,E.\n\n   ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.\n\n   ""SMITE"": S,M,I,T,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N.\n\n Which of these gives maximum information?\n\n We also want to cover more vowels and common consonants. The word ""STYLE"" has Y which is a vowel sometimes? But less common.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to put a common vowel in the middle? Or we can aim for consonants that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (minus C,R,A,N and E is known only at the end).\n\n Considering ""QUINE"" but that might be too rare? Also, Q is not very common. Let me pick a word with more common letters.\n\n How about ""SHINE""? S,H,I,N -> wait, N is forbidden? Feedback said N(x) so N is not present -> so we cannot use N. So ""shine"" is invalid.\n\n Remember: we cannot use N because the first word had N and it was not present.\n\n So words that avoid C,R,A,N and also any letter that we now know is absent.\n\n Let me find words ending in E without C,R,A,N:\n\n   With S: ""SLATE"" has A -> invalid.\n   ""SPITE"": S,P,I,T,E -> no A,R,N,C -> valid.\n   ""SMILE"": S,M,I,L,E -> valid.\n   ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> valid. But note O is a common vowel.\n\n   With T: ""TITLE"": T,I,T,L,E -> avoid? Has T twice? But we don\'t know if T is present? It could be. The word is valid.\n\n   With U: ""PRUDE"" has P,R? R is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" has H,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? H,O,U,S,E: none of these are C,R,A,N -> valid.\n\n However, we have E in the fifth position, but we don\'t know about the rest. We also don\'t know about duplicates? But ""house"" uses H,O,U,S.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUSE"" has M,O,U,S,E -> avoiding C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n But is there a reason to avoid M? We don\'t know yet.\n\n How about ""BIOME""? B,I,O,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? But we have to check: B,I,O,M,E -> none of the forbidden letters -> valid. But is it a common word? It might be acceptable.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that maximizes coverage of common letters.\n\n My strategy: since we only know E at the end and four letters that are absent, choose a word that uses new letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n\n Common vowels: I, O, U? But U is less common. How about I and O.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S,T,O,L,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N.\n\n But wait, what about ""STOLE"": \n   If we try ""STOLE"", and get feedback, we can learn about S,T,O,L.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLIME"": S,L,I,M,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n However, we have already tried E in the last position? We know E is present only in the last position? Not necessarily, but we only know the last position has E. There could be E in another position? But in the first word we didn\'t have E elsewhere? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n The word ""SLIME"" has E in last position? Yes. Letters: S,L,I,M,E.\n\n But note: the first word ""crane"" had E in the last position and we got a ✓ for E meaning it\'s in the right place. So the secret word ends with E. But is there an E elsewhere? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. So using E only at the end is required? Not necessarily for the guess? We can use E elsewhere? But if we use E twice, then for the feedback, if the word has only one E, it might mark the extra as x? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we want to get new information. So using E again in another position might be wasteful? Because we know that if we put an E in position 2, and it\'s not the secret word\'s E, then we\'ll get an x? But that would be useful if the secret word has only one E. However, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using E again in the guess? The rules don\'t prevent it, but strategically we might want to try different letters.\n\n Given that we have so many letters to test, I think it\'s better to avoid E in other positions for this guess? So let\'s pick words that only have E at the end.\n\n That means words that have E exclusively at the last position? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t put E elsewhere, then we know that any E elsewhere is not present? Actually, no: because if we put E in a wrong place, the feedback will show it as absent? But that\'s not true: if the secret word has two E\'s, then putting an E in the wrong place would show as \'-\' meaning wrong position? So if we avoid using E elsewhere, we don\'t risk wasting a letter? Or we can test if the secret word has multiple E\'s? But that might be a good strategy? \n\n Given that, let me go with ""STOLE"": S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N and uses common letters.\n\n But let me confirm: \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E at the end.\n\n This word: STOLE.\n\n We\'ll get feedback on each letter: \n   If we get ✓ for S in position 1? Then we know that S is at the start.\n   But if not, we can learn.\n\n Another candidate: ""HOUSE"" or ""MOUSE"", ""POISE"", etc.\n\n Let me choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> ends with E, avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And it has vowels O and I.\n\n Or ""SHIRE"" -> but has R? R is forbidden? R(x) in the first guess.\n\n So avoid R.\n\n How about ""THOSE"": T,H,O,S,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? T,H,O,S,E -> yes. But note: we have O and E? But E we already know is at the end.\n\n Let me decide: since we have to cover vowels, O and I are a priority? So ""POISE"" uses P,O,I,S,E? Or ""MOIST""? But ""moist"" doesn\'t end with E. We need it to end with E.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E.\n\n However, note that ""poise"" has E at the end? Yes: positions: P[1], O[2], I[3], S[4], E[5]. Also, it has common letters P,O,I,S.\n\n Therefore, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHINE"" has N -> invalid. \n\n Or ""SUITE"": S,U,I,T,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S,U,I,T,E -> yes, and ends with E.\n\n But I prefer covering O? We haven\'t tried O. So ""POISE"" seems better? \n\n But what about ""SPIKE""? S,P,I,K,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. And has K? Also common.\n\n However, I decide: ""POISE""\n\n Let me try ""POISE""\n\n<guess>poise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed in the 5th position (E is present and correct).\n- C, R, A, and N are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (5th letter).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n- Focus on introducing new common letters to maximize information, such as vowels (O, I) and consonants like S, T, P.\n\nSelected ""POISE"" because:\n- Ends with E (position 5) to leverage known information.\n- Contains new unverified letters: P, O, I, S.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and isn\'t likely to waste positions.\n- Provides coverage for multiple common vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and S).\n\nThis guess may reveal which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>poise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x), O(x), I(x), S(x), E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).\n- P, O, I, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, O, I, S.\n\nWe now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that ends with E and uses only the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding these.\n\nThe English alphabet: A to Z.\n\nExcluded letters (8 letters): A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters (18 letters): B, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: E is already in the word at the end, but it might appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s. But in our feedback, we only have E at position 5. Since we haven\'t tested E in other positions, it\'s possible that E appears only once or multiple times.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had E only at the end, and in the second guess, we had E only at the end. So we haven\'t tested E in other positions. Therefore, the secret word might have E only at the end or also in other positions.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the feedback for ""poise"" showed that S is absent, and S was in position 4. Similarly, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and the others absent.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to form a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test other letters)\n\nBut we have to use 5-letter words. Also, we want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nHowever, we have 18 letters left, but we can only use 4 new letters (since position 5 is fixed as E). So we need to choose 4 letters from the remaining.\n\nBut note: we can use E in other positions? For example, if we put E in position 1, then we can test if there is an E at the beginning? But if we do that, we might use a slot that could be used for a new letter. Since we have limited guesses, it might be better to avoid using E in other positions to test more new letters? Or we can test for multiple E\'s.\n\nGiven that we have only 6 guesses and we are on guess 3, we have 4 guesses left. We might want to test for the presence of E in other positions? But let\'s see: if the secret word has only one E (at the end), then putting E elsewhere would be a waste? But if it has two, we need to know.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid E for now and test other letters, and if we get stuck, we can test E.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that end with E and use the remaining letters.\n\nCommon words ending in E: \n  Examples: \n    ""TABLE"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the excluded list -> invalid.\n    ""LATHE"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n    ""BULGE"" -> B,U,L,G,E -> check: B, U, L, G are not excluded? \n        Excluded: A,C,I,N,O,P,R,S -> so B,U,L,G are allowed.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nAnother: ""MULCH"" -> but ends with H? Not E.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\nPossible words: \n  ""BULGE"": B,U,L,G,E -> letters: B,U,L,G,E -> all allowed? \n      B: allowed, U: allowed, L: allowed, G: allowed, E: allowed (at end, and we can use E only at end? but we are using it at end). \n      So ""BULGE"" is a candidate.\n\n  ""BUGLE"": B,U,G,L,E -> same letters? B,U,G,L,E -> also valid.\n\n  ""QUOTE"": Q,U,O,T,E -> but O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TUNED"": T,U,N,E,D -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""JUMBLE"": too long? 6 letters -> invalid.\n\n  ""HUMVE"": not a word.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> F,U,D,G are allowed? \n      F: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""MUDGE"": M,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> valid.\n\n  ""FUGUE"": F,U,G,U,E -> has two U\'s?

Also, ""fugue"" is a word.\n\n  ""GUMMY"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> ends with E, but has E in position 4 and 5? And two U\'s? \n      But Q is allowed? \n      However, we have to check: Q,U,E,U,E -> positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). \n      But we are forced to have E at position 5? So that\'s okay. But we are using E at position 3? That might be useful to test if E is at position 3? \n      But we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, ""queue"" has duplicate U and E? \n\n  ""QUEUE"" might be a valid word, but it uses E in position 3 and 5. If we use it, we can test if E is in position 3? But if the secret word has only one E (at 5), then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two E\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? \n\n  However, we are trying to cover new letters. ""QUEUE"" uses Q and U, which are less common? \n\n  Let me think of more common words.\n\n  ""GLIDE"": G,L,I,D,E -> but I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""TIMED"": T,I,M,E,D -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BLOKE"": B,L,O,K,E -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> F,L,U,K are allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""JUICE"": J,U,I,C,E -> I and C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""QUAKE"": Q,U,A,K,E -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> T,H,Y,M are allowed? \n      T: allowed, H: allowed, Y: allowed, M: allowed -> valid.\n\n  ""STYLE"": but S is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WHILE"": W,H,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""PHONE"": P and O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEMUR"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n  ""TEPEE"": T,E,P,E,E -> P excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but E is used multiple times?

However, we are using E in positions 1,4,5? \n      But we know position 5 is E, so we are testing E in position 1 and 4? \n      But ""belle"" has E at 1,4,5? \n      However, the word ""belle"" is valid? But let\'s see: \n          Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: L, 4: L, 5: E -> but that\'s 5 letters? \n      Actually, ""belle"" is spelled B-E-L-L-E, so positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E. \n      But we are avoiding excluded letters? \n          B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. \n          But we are using E in position 2? That might be useful? \n      However, we are on guess 3, and we have many letters to test. Also, we are using L twice? \n\n  But we have to consider: we are limited by the available letters. \n\n  After reviewing, good candidates are:\n      ""BULGE"", ""BUGLE"", ""FUDGE"", ""MUDGE"", ""BUDGE"", ""FLUKE"", ""THYME"", ""FUGUE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE""\n\n  We want to choose one that uses as many common letters as possible? But among the remaining, which are common? \n      Common consonants: T, L, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.\n      Vowels: U, E (but E we know is at end), and Y (which can be a vowel).\n\n  Also, we might avoid using E in other positions to save for testing other letters? But if we don\'t use E, we can test 4 new letters? \n\n  For example, in ""BULGE"", we are using B,U,L,G,E -> E only at the end? So we are testing 4 new letters: B,U,L,G.\n\n  Similarly, ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> testing F,L,U,K.\n\n  ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> testing T,H,Y,M.\n\n  ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> testing F,U,D,G.\n\n  All of these are good.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid using letters that might be less common? Like Q, X, Z? So I\'ll avoid ""QUEUE"" and ""FUGUE"" for now.\n\n  How about ""BELLE""? It uses E in position 2 and 4? That might be useful to test if E is present elsewhere? But if we don\'t test E elsewhere, we might miss it? \n\n  Since we have 4 guesses left, we can test for E in the next guess if needed? But let\'s see: if we use a word without E in other positions, and we get feedback that doesn\'t reveal the word, we might have to test E later? \n\n  Alternatively, if we use a word with E in another position, we can get information about multiple E\'s? \n\n  I think it\'s a trade-off. Given that, I\'ll choose a word that does not use E in other positions to maximize testing of new letters? \n\n  So let\'s pick ""THYME"": T,H,Y,M,E -> because it has T and H which are common, and Y and M are also common? \n\n  But Y is less common? \n\n  Another word: ""BLUKE"" is not a word? \n\n  ""FLUME"": F,L,U,M,E -> F,L,U,M,E -> all allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, M: allowed -> valid. \n      And it ends with E.\n\n  ""FLUME"" vs ""THYME"": \n      ""FLUME"" has F,L,U,M -> which are common? \n      ""THYME"" has T,H,Y,M -> T and H are very common.\n\n  I think ""THYME"" is a good choice because T and H are high-frequency letters.\n\n  But let me check: we have not used T or H yet? \n\n  In the first guess: crane -> no T or H.\n  Second guess: poise -> no T or H.\n\n  So T and H are untested.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""THYME"".\n\n  Guess: THYME\n\n  But note: ""thyme"" is a common word? Yes, it\'s a herb.\n\n  So, <guess>thyme</guess>\n\n  However, let me confirm the spelling: T-H-Y-M-E, 5 letters.\n\n  Yes.\n\n  Alternatively, ""BUDGE"": B,U,D,G,E -> also common letters? B, U, D, G.\n\n  But T and H are more common than B, U, D, G? \n\n  Frequency in English: \n      T is very common, H is common, then B, D, G, U.\n\n  So ""THYME"" might be better.\n\n  Also, Y is a vowel-like letter? So we can get vowel information? \n\n  Therefore, I go with ""THYME"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: **A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S** (from ""crane"" and ""poise"" feedback).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with \'E\' and avoid the excluded letters.\n- Focus on testing new common consonants (e.g., T, H, M, L) and vowels (e.g., U, Y) from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n- ""THYME"" is chosen because:\n  - It ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n  - Uses new high-frequency letters: T, H, Y, M (all untested).\n  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes duplicate letter testing.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

P, O, I, S are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓)\nMeaning: E is again confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- The following letters are absent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.\n\nWe now know that the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd the letters that are not present: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut note: E is in the word at the end, but we don\'t know if it appears elsewhere. However, we haven\'t tested E in other positions, so it might be present elsewhere? But we have to consider that the feedback for E has always been correct in position 5, but if there were another E, it might have been caught? Not necessarily, because we haven\'t placed E in other positions.\n\nIn the first three guesses, we only had E at position 5. So we don\'t know if the secret word has E in other positions.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5)\n- Uses only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly E in other positions, but we might avoid it to test new letters)\n\nWe have 13 letters left. We need to choose 4 letters from these (plus E at the end) to form a word.\n\nCommon words ending in E with these letters:\n\n- ""BLUFF"": doesn\'t end with E? Ends with F.\n- ""BLUEE"": not a word.\n- ""GLADE"": but A is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> but K is allowed? Let\'s check: K is in the remaining list? Yes. But in guess 3, we used ""thyme"" and M was absent, but K hasn\'t been tested? Actually, we haven\'t used K yet? \n  Guess 1: crane -> no K\n  Guess 2: poise -> no K\n  Guess 3: thyme -> no K\n  So K is available. But ""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K,E -> all allowed? \n      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, K: allowed -> valid.\n  However, we are using E only at the end? So we are testing F,L,U,K.\n\n- ""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> J,U,D,G are allowed? \n      J: allowed, U: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.\n\n- ""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> same as above?

And Q and U. \n      Q: allowed, U: allowed, E: allowed? But we are testing E at position 3? \n      This might be useful to see if there\'s an E at position 3? \n      But we are on guess 4, and we have 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess? \n      We have 6 guesses total, so after this, 2 left? \n\n- ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> but we are using E at positions 2 and 4? And B and L. \n      B: allowed, E: allowed, L: allowed. \n      But we are using L twice? \n      However, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the secret word might have duplicates? \n      But we haven\'t encountered any yet? \n\n- ""DEUCE"": D,E,U,C,E -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""LEMUR"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n- ""VEXED"": V,E,X,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.\n\n- ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? W,E,D,G,E -> positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). \n      So it ends with E? Yes. \n      Letters: W, E, D, G, E -> W, D, G are allowed? \n      W: allowed, D: allowed, G: allowed -> valid.\n      But we are using E at position 2? So we can test if E is at position 2? \n\n- ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> similar, but L is allowed? \n      L: allowed -> valid.\n\n- ""JELLY"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n- ""KEBAB"": doesn\'t end with E and A excluded.\n\n- ""FJORD"": doesn\'t end with E and O excluded.\n\n- ""BLUED"": B,L,U,E,D -> ends with D? Not E.\n\n- ""BLUES"": B,L,U,E,S -> but S excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""GLOBE"": G,L,O,B,E -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""GUIDE"": G,U,I,D,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""JUICE"": I and C excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""QUILL"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n- ""VALUE"": V,A,L,U,E -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""WEDGE"" we already considered.\n\n- ""BOXED"": B,O,X,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""JOKED"": J,O,K,E,D -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""JOULE"": J,O,U,L,E -> O excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""LUNGE"": L,U,N,G,E -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""MOURN"": doesn\'t end with E and O excluded.\n\n- ""PURGE"": P excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""RANGE"": R and A excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""SINGE"": S and I excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""TUNED"": T and N excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""WIPED"": W,I,P,E,D -> I and P excluded -> invalid.\n\n- ""ZEBRA"": A excluded and doesn\'t end with E.\n\nSo, possible words: \n  ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", ""FUDGE"", ""QUEUE"", ""BELLE"", ""WEDGE"", ""LEDGE"", etc.\n\nWe need to choose one that gives good information.\n\nNote: We have not tested the letter U? Actually, we haven\'t used U in any guess? \n  Guess1: crane -> no U\n  Guess2: poise -> no U\n  Guess3: thyme -> no U\nSo U is untested.\n\nSimilarly, we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded ones.\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible? \n\n""QUEUE"": Q,U,E,U,E -> uses Q, U, and E (twice). But it has duplicate U and E? \n  Positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), U(4), E(5). \n  We are testing Q and U? But we are using E at position 3? \n  If we use this, we can test:\n      If Q is in the word? \n      If U is in the word? \n      If E is at position 3? \n  But we are using two slots for U and two for E? So we are only testing two new letters? \n\n""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> tests F,L,U,K -> four new letters? \n  And E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? \n\n""JUDGE"": J,U,D,G,E -> tests J,U,D,G -> four new letters? \n\n""FUDGE"": F,U,D,G,E -> tests F,U,D,G -> four new letters? \n\n""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> tests W,D,G? But we are using E at position 2? So we are testing W,D,G and also testing E at position 2? \n  So we are testing three new letters? \n\n""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> tests B,L? But we are using E at position 2 and 4? And L twice? \n  So we are testing B and L? Only two new letters? \n\nTherefore, to maximize new letters, ""FLUKE"", ""JUDGE"", or ""FUDGE"" are better? \n\nBut note: we have to consider the frequency of letters? \n\nCommon letters among the remaining: \n  F, L, D, G, U, K, B, W, etc.\n\n""FLUKE"" has F,L,U,K -> all fairly common? \n""JUDGE"" has J,U,D,G -> J is less common? \n""FUDGE"" has F,U,D,G -> F,U,D,G are common? \n\nI think ""FUDGE"" is a good choice? But we have ""FLUKE"" which includes K? \n\nAlternatively, we can test for U? Since U is a vowel? \n\nBut we have to choose one. \n\nAlso, we might want to avoid using E in other positions? Because if we use E in position 2 (like in ""WEDGE""), we might get information about E? But if we don\'t, we can test more new letters? \n\nGiven that we have 3 guesses left after this, I think testing more new letters is better? \n\nSo I choose ""FLUKE"": F,L,U,K,E -> because it tests four new letters: F,L,U,K.\n\nBut note: in ""FLUKE"", we are using E only at the end? So we are not testing E elsewhere? \n\nIf the secret word has an E in position 2, we won\'t know? But we can test that later? \n\nSo, let\'s go with ""FLUKE"".\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n- The secret word ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n- Absent letters: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"").\n- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with \'E\' and avoid all excluded letters.\n- Focus on testing new common letters from the remaining set to maximize information.\n- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:\n  - Ends with \'E\' (position 5).\n  - Uses new untested letters: F, L, U, K (all allowed and common).\n  - Avoids E in other positions to prioritize testing new letters.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we know:\n- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n- The following letters are **absent**: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M (from ""crane"", ""poise"", and ""thyme"" feedback).\n- The remaining possible letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" and use only the remaining letters.\n- ""FLUKE"" is chosen because:\n  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n  - It tests 4 new high-frequency letters: F, L, U, K.\n  - It avoids redundant letters and maximizes coverage of the remaining alphabet.\n  - Common letters like F, L, and U increase the chance of hits.\n\n<guess>fluke</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: fluke -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nMeaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

P, O, I, S are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nMeaning: E is confirmed in position 5. T, H, Y, M are not in the word.\n\nGuess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)\nMeaning: \n  - E is in position 5 (correct as before).\n  - F is absent (x).\n  - L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n  - U is absent (x).\n  - K is absent (x).\n\nSo, new information:\n- The letter L is in the secret word, but not in position 4 (since we placed L in position 4 and got a \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n- F, U, K are absent.\n\nNow, updating the list of absent letters:\nAbsent: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K.\n\nRemaining letters (from previous possible set minus these): \nPrevious remaining: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\nBut now F, U, K are absent, so remove F, U, K.\nAlso, we now know L is present, so it\'s in the word but not in position 4.\n\nSo remaining possible letters that haven\'t been eliminated: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z and we know L must be included somewhere.\n\nBut L is present, and we have the position constraints: it cannot be in position 4.\n\nAlso, the word must end with E (position 5).\n\nThe secret word has exactly 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> E at position 5.\n\nWe have L present, and not at position 4.\n\nAlso, the word must contain only letters that are not in the absent set and must include L.\n\nSo possible letters: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But we haven\'t tested all of these? We know L is present, but the others might be present or not? No, we don\'t know about the others: they could be present or absent?\n\nWe know L is present. For the other letters, they are still uncertain until tested? But we have to form a word from the remaining possible letters? Not exactly: the word can contain any letter that hasn\'t been excluded, including L and possibly others.\n\nBut we must include L because we know it\'s present.\n\nSo the word must:\n- End with E: position 5 = E\n- Include the letter L (but not at position 4)\n- Avoid: A, C, I, N, O, P, R, S, T, H, Y, M, F, U, K\n- Use letters from: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z and E (but E is already at the end).\n\nBut E might also appear elsewhere? We don\'t know because we haven\'t tested E in other positions.\n\nWe are on guess 5, with two guesses left? Let me count: we have made 4 guesses, so we have 2 left.\n\nWe now know that L is in the word, so we can form words that include L.\n\nPossible positions for L: since it\'s not at position 4, it can be at positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe now have to guess a word that:\n- Ends with E.\n- Includes L (somewhere except position 4).\n- Uses only possible letters (not excluded) and E.\n\nBut note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know? Since L might be duplicated? But we haven\'t seen evidence.\n\nNow, let\'s list the available letters: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Z, and L, and E (but E is fixed at the end).\n\nWe have to choose 4 letters for the first 4 positions? But one of the positions must be L? Actually, the word must have L somewhere in positions 1-3? Because position 4 cannot have L? And position 5 is E.\n\nSo positions 1,2,3,4: one of them is L? But we have to fill all positions? And the letter L must be present? Yes.\n\nSo one of positions 1,2,3 must be L? Or could L be in position 4? No, because in ""fluke"" we placed L at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning it is present but not there. So L is not at position 4. Therefore, L must be at position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the word must be formed with letters from: B,D,G,J,Q,V,W,X,Z plus L and E? But E is already at the end.\n\nNow, for the non-L positions, we must use letters from the possible set? And we cannot use excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that contain L? And avoid the excluded letters.\n\nCommon words: \n  ""TABLE"": but A and B? A is excluded -> invalid.\n  ""LATHE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n  ""BLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n  ""GLADE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n  ""LEGAL"": doesn\'t end with E -> invalid.\n\nPossible words:\n\n  ""BELLE"": B,E,L,L,E -> positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:L, 4:L, 5:E.\n  But we are using E at position 2? We can test if E is present at position 2? \n  And L twice? \n  Also, letters: B, E, L -> B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B? \n  Excluded letters: we have excluded U,K, etc., but B is not excluded? \n  And E we know is at 5, but we are testing E at 2? \n  So: \n    Position 1: B (not tested yet)\n    Position 2: E (tested? We know E is at 5, but we don\'t know about position 2)\n    Position 3: L (we know L is in the word)\n    Position 4: L (duplicate? We don\'t know if duplicates allowed)\n    Position 5: E (known)\n\n  But note: we have excluded many letters? We didn\'t exclude B? So B is allowed? \n  However, in the word ""belle"", we have two L\'s and two E\'s? \n\n  ""JELLY"": doesn\'t end with E? Ends with Y? \n  ""JELLE"" is not a word? \n\n  ""VALUE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WEDGE"": W,E,D,G,E -> ends with E? Yes. \n    Positions: W(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). \n    Letters: W, E, D, G -> W, D, G haven\'t been tested? And E at 2.\n    But what about L? We need L? This word doesn\'t have L? But we know the secret word has L? \n    Therefore, we must include L? So ""wedge"" doesn\' t have L? So it\'s invalid? \n\n  We must include L? So the word must have L.\n\n  Words with L? \n\n  How about ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. \n    But we have L at 1? We don\'t know where L is? \n    Letters: L, E, D, G -> D and G are allowed? \n    And we are testing L at 1? \n    But we know L is at one of the first three? Here in position 1? \n    Also, E at 2? \n    And E at 5? \n    Avoids excluded letters: yes.\n\n  ""BELLE"": as above.\n\n  ""BEVEL"": B,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E. \n  ""BELLE"" is the same as before? \n\n  ""LEVEL"": L,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? Not E.\n\n  ""GLOBE"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""PLUME"": P excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DELLE"": is it a word? ""delle"" might not be common? \n\n  ""VELLE"" not common? \n\n  ""WELLE"" not common? \n\n  ""LENSE"": but N excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""GELLE"" not common? \n\n  Perhaps ""BELIE"": B,E,L,I,E -> but I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""EXILE"": E,X,I,L,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""JEWEL"": J,E,W,E,L -> ends with L? Not E? \n\n  Words ending with LE? But we need E at position 5? So words ending in LE would have L at position 4? But we cannot have L at position 4? Because in ""fluke"" we tried L at position 4 and it was wrong position? Actually, the feedback for L was \'-\' which means present but not in position 4? So we cannot put L at position 4? \n\n  Therefore, words ending in E but not LE? Or with L not at the end? \n\n  How about ""GLIDE"": L at 3? But I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BULGE"": L at 3? But U excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BUDGE"": L not present? \n\n  Wait, we need L? \n\n  So possible words: \n    Only ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"" come to mind? \n\n  ""LEDGE"": L,E,D,G,E -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E.\n\n  But we have to check if G is allowed? Yes? Not excluded? \n\n  And D? Allowed? \n\n  Also, let me check if ""bedge"" is a word? Probably not? \n\n  Another word: ""BOLD"": not 5 letters? \n\n  ""DEVEL"": D,E,V,E,L -> ends with L? \n\n  But we need ends with E? \n\n  Perhaps ""ZESTE"": but we need L? Doesn\'t have L? \n\n  Maybe ""LIEGE"": L,I,E,G,E -> I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BOXLE"": not a word? \n\n  So limited options? \n\n  ""VEDGE"": V,E,D,G,E -> but no L? \n\n  We must have L? So words without L are invalid.\n\n  How about ""LATKE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So back to ""BELLE"" and ""LEDGE"".\n\n  ""BELLE"": B-E-L-L-E -> has L at positions 3 and 4? But position 4 has L? But we cannot put L at position 4? Because the feedback said L is not at position 4? \n\n  In ""fluke"", we put L at position 4 and got \'-\' but \'-\' means the letter is in the word but wrong position? So if the secret word has L at position 4? Then it would be correct? Then it would be marked \'✓\'? But we got \'-\', meaning L is not at position 4? So the secret word has L elsewhere? But in ""BELLE"", if we put L at position 4, it would be wrong? Because the secret word doesn\'t have L at position 4. \n\n  But in ""belle"", position 4 is L? We shouldn\'t put L at position 4? Because it will be marked \'-\'? Not helpful? \n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid putting L at position 4? \n\n  So ""BELLE"" might be problematic because it forces L at position 4? \n\n  ""LEDGE"": L at position 1? Which is allowed? Because L can be at 1,2, or 3? \n\n  Also, in ""LEDGE"", we are putting L at position 1, E at position 2? \n\n  We haven\'t tested E at position 2? \n\n  Now, for the next guess, we can choose ""LEDGE"": \n\n    Positions: \n      1: L (we are testing L at position 1? But we know L is present, so we are actually just testing its position)\n      2: E (testing E at position 2? Which might be present or not? Or it might be correct? But we only know E at position 5)\n      3: D (new letter)\n      4: G (new letter)\n      5: E (known)\n\n  So if we get:\n      If L at 1: ✓ (if it\'s in the secret word at 1) or \'-\' if L is elsewhere?\n      E at 2: ✓ if E is at 2? Or \'-\' if E is elsewhere? Or \'x\' if no other E? \n      D at 3: feedback\n      G at 4: feedback\n\n  This could be informative? \n\n  But note: the secret word may or may not have E at position 2? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a word that puts L at one of the possible positions? And avoids E elsewhere? To test other letters? \n\n  But we don\'t have many letters left? And we need to include L? And end with E.\n\n  How about ""LABEL"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEAVE"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEGER"": R excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEGAL"": A excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LEVEL"": ends with L? Not E? \n\n  ""LIBEL"": I excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WHELK"": H excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BELGA"": no E ending? \n\n  So very few words.\n\n  Another word: ""WELGE""? Not common? \n\n  ""EDGED"": ends with D? \n\n  ""JAGGED"": 6 letters? \n\n  Perhaps ""ELVER"": ends with R -> invalid? \n\n  ""DELVE"": ends with E -> D,E,L,V,E -> positions: D(1), E(2), L(3), V(4), E(5). \n    Letters: D,E,L,V -> D and V are allowed? \n    And L at position 3? \n    Avoids excluded letters? Yes? \n    But what about the fifth letter? Ends with E? Yes? \n    And L is at position 3? We can put L at 3? \n    Also, E at position 2? \n\n  So ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.\n\n  Similarly, ""SELVE"" is not a common word? \n\n  ""SHELV"" not? \n\n  So ""DELVE"" is a word? Meaning a small stream? Or part of ""delve into""? \n\n  Acceptable? \n\n  ""JELAB"": not? \n\n  ""VELDT"": ends with T? Not E? \n\n  So options seem to be ""LEDGE"", ""BELLE"", ""DELVE"".\n\n  But ""BELLE"" has L at position 4? Which we know is wrong? \n\n  Therefore, better to avoid ""BELLE""? \n\n  Between ""LEDGE"" and ""DELVE"":\n\n  ""LEDGE"": L at 1, E at 2, D at 3, G at 4, E at 5.\n  ""DELVE"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3, V at 4, E at 5.\n\n  Both have E at position 2? We need to test new letters.\n\n  ""LEDGE"" uses L,E,D,G -> E is reused? \n  ""DELVE"" uses D,E,L,V -> E reused? \n\n  But they use different letters: D,G vs D,V? \n  Actually, ""LEDGE"" uses D and G? ""DELVE"" uses D and V? \n\n  We haven\'t tested D, G, V.\n\n  In terms of coverage: ""LEDGE"" covers G? ""DELVE"" covers V? So depending on which letter we want to test? \n\n  But we can only pick one? \n\n  Also, note: position for L: \n      In ""LEDGE"", L at 1: we get feedback on position 1 for L? If it\'s correct, we know. If it\'s wrong position, we know L is at 2 or 3? \n      In ""DELVE"", L at 3: feedback at position 3.\n\n  Since we have two guesses? Let me choose ""DELVE"": because it doesn\'t duplicate letters? (just D, E, L, V, E ... has E twice? but that\'s okay)\n\n  But ""LEDGE"" also has E twice? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to avoid E in other positions? But that might be impossible? \n\n  How about ""BULGED""? 6 letters.\n\n  ""LUNGE"": N excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LARGE"": A and R excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""LOWED"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""PLIED"": P excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So I think ""DELVE"" or ""LEDGE"" are the two options? \n\n  Let me pick ""DELVE"": D,E,L,V,E.\n\n  We choose ""DELVE"".\n\n<guess>delve</guess>Based on the cumulative feedback:\n- The secret word ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n- Letters **absent**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, Y (from all feedback).\n- **Known presence**: L is in the word but not in position 4 (per ""fluke"" feedback showing L as ""-"").\n- Available letters to use: B, D, G, J, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (and E at position 5).\n\nFor this guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" (position 5), include ""L"" (but not at position 4), and avoid all excluded letters.\n- ""DELVE"" (D-E-L-V-E) is chosen because:\n  - It ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n  - Includes ""L"" in position 3 (a new position not yet tested).\n  - Tests new letters: D, V (untested), while confirming L and E positions.\n  - Avoids known absent letters and focuses on resolving L\'s position and introducing high-potential consonants.\n\n<guess>delve</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: poise -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: fluke -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 5: delve -> FEEDBACK: D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). P, O, I, S are absent.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). T, H, Y, M are absent.

Guess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). L is present but not in position 4. F, U, K are absent.

Guess 5: ""delve"" -> D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓)
Meaning: 
  - Position 1: D is present but not in the correct position (D(-)).
  - Position 2: E is in the correct position (E(✓))? But wait, the feedback says E(✓) for position 2? 
      However, we already knew E is at position 5, but now we have E at position 2? 
      The feedback: D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓)
      So:
        Position 1: D -> present but wrong position (so D is in the word, not at position 1)
        Position 2: E -> correct position (so E is at position 2)
        Position 3: L -> present but wrong position (so L is in the word, not at position 3)
        Position 4: V -> absent (V(x))
        Position 5: E -> correct position (as before)

So new information:
1. The secret word has E at position 2 and position 5.
2. D is in the word, but not at position 1.
3. L is in the word, but not at position 3 (and not at position 4, from previous guess).
4. V is absent.

Also, from previous, we know L is not at position 4 (from guess 4) and now not at position 3 (from guess 5). So L must be at position 1? Because positions 3 and 4 are ruled out? And position 2 is E? Position 5 is E? So the only position left for L is position 1? 

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- L cannot be at 3 (from ""delve"" feedback) and cannot be at 4 (from ""fluke"" feedback). 
- So L must be at position 1? Because position 1 is the only one left? 

But what about position 3 and 4? We have positions 1,3,4 for L? But we ruled out 3 and 4? So only position 1 is possible? 

Therefore, L must be at position 1.

Also, D is present but not at position 1? But position 1 is L? So D must be at position 3 or 4? 

And we know V is absent.

Now, updating absent letters:
Absent: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y. (from all feedback: crane, poise, thyme, fluke, delve)

Remaining possible letters: B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z. And we have D and L? But L is now fixed at position 1? And D is present? 

Also, we have E at positions 2 and 5.

So the secret word is: L _ _ _ E, with E at position 2? No: position 2 is E? 

The secret word: 
  Position 1: L (we just deduced)
  Position 2: E (from feedback)
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: ? 
  Position 5: E

And we know D is in the word? But not at position 1? So D must be at position 3 or 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have two positions left: 3 and 4? 

But we have two positions and one letter D to place? And one more letter? 

The word must have two more letters? Because we have L, E, E, D, and one more? 

The secret word: L, E, ?, ?, E

And D is one of the ? and there is another letter? 

We know the word has D? And we have two positions: 3 and 4? 

But we don't know if there is a duplicate? 

Also, the remaining letters available: B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z? And D? 

But D is already in the word? So for positions 3 and 4, one is D and the other is one of B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z? 

But we don't know which position for D? 

Also, the word must be a valid English word? 

So possible words: 
  L E ? ? E

With the third and fourth letters: one is D and the other is from {B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z}

But we have to form a valid word? 

Let's list possibilities:

  L E D ? E -> but then the fourth letter must be one of the remaining? 
      L E D B E -> ""ledbe""? not a word.
      L E D G E -> ""ledge"" -> but we already tried ""ledge""? Actually, we tried ""delve"", not ""ledge"". 
          ""ledge"" is a word? Yes, meaning a narrow shelf? 
          But we haven't tried it? 
      L E D J E -> ""ledje""? not a word.
      L E D Q E -> ""ledqe""? not a word.
      L E D W E -> ""ledwe""? not a word.
      L E D X E -> ""ledxe""? not a word.
      L E D Z E -> ""ledze""? not a word.

  So only ""ledge"" is a word? 

  Alternatively, D at position 4? 
      L E ? D E -> 
        L E B D E -> ""lebde""? not a word.
        L E G D E -> ""legde""? not a word? 
        L E J D E -> ""lejde""? not a word.
        L E Q D E -> ""leqde""? not a word.
        L E W D E -> ""lewed""? but that ends with D? Not E? 
        L E X D E -> ""lexde""? not a word.
        L E Z D E -> ""lezde""? not a word.

  So only ""ledge"" seems possible? 

  But ""ledge"" is L-E-D-G-E? 
      Position 1: L
      Position 2: E
      Position 3: D
      Position 4: G
      Position 5: E

  And we haven't tested G? 

  But we have to check if G is allowed? 
      We haven't excluded G? 
      From the absent list: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y -> G is not in the list? So G is allowed? 

  Therefore, the secret word must be ""ledge""? 

  But let me confirm: 
      We have L at position 1? We deduced? 
      E at position 2? 
      D at position 3? 
      G at position 4? 
      E at position 5? 

  And we have feedback that supports? 
      In guess 5: ""delve"" -> D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 1? In ""ledge"", D is at position 3? So that would be correct? 
      Also, L(-) in ""delve"" was at position 3? But in ""ledge"", L is at position 1? So that's why it was marked as present but wrong position? 
      And V was absent? 

  Also, in guess 4: ""fluke"" had L at position 4? But in ""ledge"", L is at 1? So that's why it was marked as present but wrong position? 

  And E at 5? Correct? 

  So it fits? 

  But we have to make sure? 

  However, we have one more guess? We are on guess 6? We have made 5 guesses? So we have one left? 

  But if we are sure, we can guess ""ledge""? 

  But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

  What about duplicate letters? 
      We have E twice? But we know E is at 2 and 5? 
      And D? Only one D? 
      And L? Only one L? 

  But what if the word has no G? And has another letter? 

  We considered only ""ledge"" as a valid word? 

  What about ""levee""? But V is excluded? 

  ""levee"" has V? But V is absent? 

  ""leaze""? A excluded? 

  ""leone""? O excluded? 

  ""lepre""? not a word? 

  ""leude""? U excluded? 

  ""lexes""? S and X? But S excluded? 

  ""lezze""? not a word? 

  So only ""ledge"" seems to fit? 

  Therefore, the secret word is ""ledge"".

  So we can guess ""ledge"".

  But note: in the feedback for ""delve"", we had E(✓) at position 2? That means position 2 is E? So in ""ledge"", position 2 is E? Correct? 

  And position 5 is E? Correct? 

  And D is at position 3? So in ""delve"", we had D at position 1? Which was wrong? But in ""ledge"", D at 3? So that's why it was marked as present? 

  And L at position 1? In ""delve"", we had L at position 3? Which was marked as present but wrong position? Because L is at 1? 

  And V was absent? 

  So it all fits? 

  Therefore, we guess ""ledge"".

<guess>ledge</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2 and 5 are ""E""**: Confirmed by multiple guesses (E(✓) in positions 2 and 5 from ""delve"").
- **Position 1 is ""L""**: 
  - L is present (from ""fluke"" and ""delve"" feedback), but cannot be in position 3 (from ""delve"" L(-)) or position 4 (from ""fluke"" L(-)). 
  - With positions 2 and 5 fixed as E, position 1 is the only valid slot left for L.
- **D is present but not in position 1**: From ""delve"" D(-), so D must be in position 3 or 4.
- **V is absent**: From ""delve"" V(x).
- **Absent letters**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y (compiled from all feedback).
- **Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4**: B, D, G, J, Q, W, X, Z (but D is confirmed present).

The secret word must be of the form: **L E ? ? E**, with one of the unknowns being D (in position 3 or 4) and the other from {B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z}. 

Testing possible words:
- **D in position 3**: Words like ""LED?E"" (e.g., LEDGE, LEDBE, etc.). Only ""LEDGE"" (L-E-D-G-E) is a valid English word.
- **D in position 4**: Words like ""LE?DE"" (e.g., LEGDE, LEBDE, etc.) yield no valid words.

Thus, ""LEDGE"" is the only feasible solution. It fits all constraints:
- L(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).
- G is not excluded and fits the remaining slot.
- Matches feedback: 
  - ""delve"" had D(-) (D is present but not at position 1) and L(-) (L is present but not at position 3).
  - All absent letters are avoided.

<guess>ledge</guess>",ledge,"We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""poise"" -> P(x) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). P, O, I, S are absent.

Guess 3: ""thyme"" -> T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). T, H, Y, M are absent.

Guess 4: ""fluke"" -> F(x) L(-) U(x) K(x) E(✓)
Meaning: E is in the correct position (5). L is present but not in position 4. F, U, K are absent.

Guess 5: ""delve"" -> D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓)
Meaning: 
  - Position 1: D is present but not in the correct position (D(-)).
  - Position 2: E is in the correct position (E(✓))? But wait, the feedback says E(✓) for position 2? 
      However, we already knew E is at position 5, but now we have E at position 2? 
      The feedback: D(-) E(✓) L(-) V(x) E(✓)
      So:
        Position 1: D -> present but wrong position (so D is in the word, not at position 1)
        Position 2: E -> correct position (so E is at position 2)
        Position 3: L -> present but wrong position (so L is in the word, not at position 3)
        Position 4: V -> absent (V(x))
        Position 5: E -> correct position (as before)

So new information:
1. The secret word has E at position 2 and position 5.
2. D is in the word, but not at position 1.
3. L is in the word, but not at position 3 (and not at position 4, from previous guess).
4. V is absent.

Also, from previous, we know L is not at position 4 (from guess 4) and now not at position 3 (from guess 5). So L must be at position 1? Because positions 3 and 4 are ruled out? And position 2 is E? Position 5 is E? So the only position left for L is position 1? 

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- L cannot be at 3 (from ""delve"" feedback) and cannot be at 4 (from ""fluke"" feedback). 
- So L must be at position 1? Because position 1 is the only one left? 

But what about position 3 and 4? We have positions 1,3,4 for L? But we ruled out 3 and 4? So only position 1 is possible? 

Therefore, L must be at position 1.

Also, D is present but not at position 1? But position 1 is L? So D must be at position 3 or 4? 

And we know V is absent.

Now, updating absent letters:
Absent: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y. (from all feedback: crane, poise, thyme, fluke, delve)

Remaining possible letters: B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z. And we have D and L? But L is now fixed at position 1? And D is present? 

Also, we have E at positions 2 and 5.

So the secret word is: L _ _ _ E, with E at position 2? No: position 2 is E? 

The secret word: 
  Position 1: L (we just deduced)
  Position 2: E (from feedback)
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: ? 
  Position 5: E

And we know D is in the word? But not at position 1? So D must be at position 3 or 4.

Also, the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have two positions left: 3 and 4? 

But we have two positions and one letter D to place? And one more letter? 

The word must have two more letters? Because we have L, E, E, D, and one more? 

The secret word: L, E, ?, ?, E

And D is one of the ? and there is another letter? 

We know the word has D? And we have two positions: 3 and 4? 

But we don't know if there is a duplicate? 

Also, the remaining letters available: B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z? And D? 

But D is already in the word? So for positions 3 and 4, one is D and the other is one of B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z? 

But we don't know which position for D? 

Also, the word must be a valid English word? 

So possible words: 
  L E ? ? E

With the third and fourth letters: one is D and the other is from {B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z}

But we have to form a valid word? 

Let's list possibilities:

  L E D ? E -> but then the fourth letter must be one of the remaining? 
      L E D B E -> ""ledbe""? not a word.
      L E D G E -> ""ledge"" -> but we already tried ""ledge""? Actually, we tried ""delve"", not ""ledge"". 
          ""ledge"" is a word? Yes, meaning a narrow shelf? 
          But we haven't tried it? 
      L E D J E -> ""ledje""? not a word.
      L E D Q E -> ""ledqe""? not a word.
      L E D W E -> ""ledwe""? not a word.
      L E D X E -> ""ledxe""? not a word.
      L E D Z E -> ""ledze""? not a word.

  So only ""ledge"" is a word? 

  Alternatively, D at position 4? 
      L E ? D E -> 
        L E B D E -> ""lebde""? not a word.
        L E G D E -> ""legde""? not a word? 
        L E J D E -> ""lejde""? not a word.
        L E Q D E -> ""leqde""? not a word.
        L E W D E -> ""lewed""? but that ends with D? Not E? 
        L E X D E -> ""lexde""? not a word.
        L E Z D E -> ""lezde""? not a word.

  So only ""ledge"" seems possible? 

  But ""ledge"" is L-E-D-G-E? 
      Position 1: L
      Position 2: E
      Position 3: D
      Position 4: G
      Position 5: E

  And we haven't tested G? 

  But we have to check if G is allowed? 
      We haven't excluded G? 
      From the absent list: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y -> G is not in the list? So G is allowed? 

  Therefore, the secret word must be ""ledge""? 

  But let me confirm: 
      We have L at position 1? We deduced? 
      E at position 2? 
      D at position 3? 
      G at position 4? 
      E at position 5? 

  And we have feedback that supports? 
      In guess 5: ""delve"" -> D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 1? In ""ledge"", D is at position 3? So that would be correct? 
      Also, L(-) in ""delve"" was at position 3? But in ""ledge"", L is at position 1? So that's why it was marked as present but wrong position? 
      And V was absent? 

  Also, in guess 4: ""fluke"" had L at position 4? But in ""ledge"", L is at 1? So that's why it was marked as present but wrong position? 

  And E at 5? Correct? 

  So it fits? 

  But we have to make sure? 

  However, we have one more guess? We are on guess 6? We have made 5 guesses? So we have one left? 

  But if we are sure, we can guess ""ledge""? 

  But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

  What about duplicate letters? 
      We have E twice? But we know E is at 2 and 5? 
      And D? Only one D? 
      And L? Only one L? 

  But what if the word has no G? And has another letter? 

  We considered only ""ledge"" as a valid word? 

  What about ""levee""? But V is excluded? 

  ""levee"" has V? But V is absent? 

  ""leaze""? A excluded? 

  ""leone""? O excluded? 

  ""lepre""? not a word? 

  ""leude""? U excluded? 

  ""lexes""? S and X? But S excluded? 

  ""lezze""? not a word? 

  So only ""ledge"" seems to fit? 

  Therefore, the secret word is ""ledge"".

  So we can guess ""ledge"".

  But note: in the feedback for ""delve"", we had E(✓) at position 2? That means position 2 is E? So in ""ledge"", position 2 is E? Correct? 

  And position 5 is E? Correct? 

  And D is at position 3? So in ""delve"", we had D at position 1? Which was wrong? But in ""ledge"", D at 3? So that's why it was marked as present? 

  And L at position 1? In ""delve"", we had L at position 3? Which was marked as present but wrong position? Because L is at 1? 

  And V was absent? 

  So it all fits? 

  Therefore, we guess ""ledge"".

<guess>ledge</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2 and 5 are ""E""**: Confirmed by multiple guesses (E(✓) in positions 2 and 5 from ""delve"").
- **Position 1 is ""L""**: 
  - L is present (from ""fluke"" and ""delve"" feedback), but cannot be in position 3 (from ""delve"" L(-)) or position 4 (from ""fluke"" L(-)). 
  - With positions 2 and 5 fixed as E, position 1 is the only valid slot left for L.
- **D is present but not in position 1**: From ""delve"" D(-), so D must be in position 3 or 4.
- **V is absent**: From ""delve"" V(x).
- **Absent letters**: A, C, F, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Y (compiled from all feedback).
- **Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4**: B, D, G, J, Q, W, X, Z (but D is confirmed present).

The secret word must be of the form: **L E ? ? E**, with one of the unknowns being D (in position 3 or 4) and the other from {B, G, J, Q, W, X, Z}. 

Testing possible words:
- **D in position 3**: Words like ""LED?E"" (e.g., LEDGE, LEDBE, etc.). Only ""LEDGE"" (L-E-D-G-E) is a valid English word.
- **D in position 4**: Words like ""LE?DE"" (e.g., LEGDE, LEBDE, etc.) yield no valid words.

Thus, ""LEDGE"" is the only feasible solution. It fits all constraints:
- L(1), E(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).
- G is not excluded and fits the remaining slot.
- Matches feedback: 
  - ""delve"" had D(-) (D is present but not at position 1) and L(-) (L is present but not at position 3).
  - All absent letters are avoided.",Guess 6: ledge -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
