We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter is A (position 2 is A).
2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Must have A in the second position.
- Must not include C, R, or N.

We can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.

Let's think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _

And we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.

But note: not in the fifth position because it got a '-' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must also avoid C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.

Examples:
- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won't be correct. But we don't know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.

But note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try to find words that have:
- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.

Also avoiding C, R, N.

Common words:
- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.

Avoiding C, R, N.

So ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.

""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.

We need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That's not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.

Pattern: _ A _ _ _

So:
- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.

Common words:
- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That's position 5? But we know E isn't position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn't have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show '-' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.

Actually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.

But we can also try words that don't put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be '-' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.

Let's avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn't give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don't know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it's still present? But '-' means it's present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won't add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.

But we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.

But we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.

List tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.

We can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.

""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don't know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don't know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn't at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.

""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.

So let's find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.

For example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don't mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don't know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don't know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn't be? We got E at 5 as '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won't be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we'll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: '-'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show '-'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got '-' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We'll get more info.

But EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".

But ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""
</think>
After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.

<guess>TAKES</guess>",TAKES,"We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)

Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.",Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,yeast,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get for the next guess.
 A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. But note: we can also consider others. Another good starter is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for now.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter is A (position 2 is A).
2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Must have A in the second position.
- Must not include C, R, or N.

We can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.

Let's think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _

And we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.

But note: not in the fifth position because it got a '-' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must also avoid C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.

Examples:
- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won't be correct. But we don't know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.

But note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try to find words that have:
- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.

Also avoiding C, R, N.

Common words:
- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.

Avoiding C, R, N.

So ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.

""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.

We need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That's not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.

Pattern: _ A _ _ _

So:
- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.

Common words:
- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That's position 5? But we know E isn't position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn't have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show '-' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.

Actually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.

But we can also try words that don't put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be '-' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.

Let's avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn't give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don't know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it's still present? But '-' means it's present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won't add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.

But we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.

But we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.

List tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.

We can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.

""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don't know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don't know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn't at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.

""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.

So let's find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.

For example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don't mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don't know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don't know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn't be? We got E at 5 as '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won't be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we'll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: '-'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show '-'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got '-' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We'll get more info.

But EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".

But ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.

Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn\'t give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don\'t know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it\'s still present? But \'-\' means it\'s present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won\'t add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.\n\nBut we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.\n\nList tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.\n\nWe can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.\n\n""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don\'t know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don\'t mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don\'t know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don\'t know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn\'t be? We got E at 5 as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won\'t be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we\'ll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: \'-\'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show \'-\'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got \'-\' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We\'ll get more info.\n\nBut EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".\n\nBut ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.\n\nTypically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E\'s might be marked correctly? And the other one might be \'x\'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E\'s? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don\'t know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.\n\nAnother word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.\n\nBut is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.\n\nOther words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.\n\nBut we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.\n\nCan we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn\'t at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get \'-\' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.\n\nBetter to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.\n\nSo let\'s prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.\n\n""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.\n\n""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.\n\nHow about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.\n\nWith E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.\n\nWith E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.\n\n""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.\n\n""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?\n\nIt\'s a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.\n\nIt fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".\n\nBut perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it\'s first? But ""TAKES"" doesn\'t have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.\n\nTherefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don\'t, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we\'ll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.\n\nThus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.\n\nIf E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, \'-\' or x? But \'-\' if it\'s somewhere? Actually, \'-\' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nAnd with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.\n\nMoreover, K and S are common enough? So that\'s a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the secret word (x).\n- R is not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).\n- N is not in the secret word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).\n\nFor the second guess, I aim to:\n1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.\n2. Keep A in the second position.\n3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).\n4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:\n- T at position 1 (new letter to test).\n- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).\n- K at position 3 (new letter to test).\n- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).\n- S at position 5 (new letter to test).\n\nThis guess allows us to test E\'s position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.\n\n<guess>TAKES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - C, R, N: not in the word.
   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - E: in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   Interpretation:
   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.
   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? 
     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). 
     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?
     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.

Rethink: 
The first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.
But second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn't make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that's against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?

Check the words:
- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: 
Breaking down:
CRANE: 
C is position 1? 
R is position 2? 
But feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
Wait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: 
C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? 

I think I miscounted positions? 

Typically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

But the feedback for CRANE: 
C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
So A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? 
Similarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.

But then in TAKES: 
TAKES: 
T (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)

Feedback: 
T(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?
A(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? 
But wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?

No: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? 

Now, in TAKES, we put:
Position 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? 
Position 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? 
But we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? 
Similarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? 
E at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? 
S at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?

So from first guess: 
- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? 
- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? 

Second guess: 
- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? 
- A at position 2: '-' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that's correct? 
- K: x? So K is not in the word? 
- E at position 4: '-' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? 
- S at position 5: '-' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? 

Moreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: 
First guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? 

From second guess: 
If E at position 4 is '-' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? 

Also, S is present? But not at position 5? 
T is present? But not at position 1? 

Therefore, summary:

Confirmed:
- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)
- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)

Additionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? 

Also, S position: present but not position 5? 
T present but not position 1? 

We also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? 

But E must be at 1 or 2? 

So possibilities: 
Secret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? 
But if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? 
Position 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? 

If E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? 

If E at 2, then position 1: some letter? 

Available letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? 

So the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? 

We have two possibilities: 
Case 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? 
Case 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? 

Now, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? 

Also, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? 

So position 1 must be some letter that we haven't tried yet? Or E? 

Similarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? 

Now, both T and S present? Let me list positions: 
1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? 
Option 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? 
Then position 2: must be a letter? We don't know? Could be T? or S? or another? 
But E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? 

But if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? 
But in TAKES: we put T at position1: got '-' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? 

Similarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? 

Also, we have E at position 2? But then position1? 

But wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? 

Therefore, letters:
- E must be at 1 or 2? 
- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? 
- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? 

Also, we know position3 is A? 

Now, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? 

But TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got '-' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? 

Therefore, possibilities:

Position1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got '-' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? 

Also, we don't know how many letters? But there are 5? 

So: 
Known: 
- Position 3 must be A? 
- E must be at position1 or2? 
- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? 
- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? 

But position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? 

And E must be at1 or2? 

If position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? 
Also position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? 
Similarly, T must be at2,4, or5? 

But position2: could be T or S? 

But wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? 

We need to form a word? 

Options ? 

Also, position4 and5? 

Secret word: 
Position1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? 

But E must be present? and at1 or2? 

So guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? 

But we also have T? 

Possible words? 

For example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don't know? 

Or we can try to include both S and T? 

Possible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? 

Try: ""EASTS""? Not valid? 

Or not: 

Common words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? 

""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got '-' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be '-'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? 

So ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? 

But E must be at1 or2? So E at2? 

So we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? 

But let me test E at1: 

Example: ""EASTS"" not? 

""ETAPE""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? 

Better: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? 

Common: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? 

How about: EASEL? Not? 

""PASTE""? But P is new? 

But let's think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? 

For example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? 

Or ""EASES""? But repeated? 

Better: ""ETALS""? Not word? 

Common word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must have a word that has:
Position3: A?
Position1: E? 
Position2: ? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

And with T and S included? 

Or not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? 

But our guess must be valid? 

So if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _

But E and A? 

Available letters: must include T and S? 

Plus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? 

For example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? 

""ESTAT""? Not? 

""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? 

""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? 

""EAT AS"" not 5? 

Perhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: 
""ETATS""? Not common? 
""ETA S"" not? 

Another: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? 

Better to do E at position2? 

Assume E at position2? Then secret: 
Position1: something? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

Then we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? 
S must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? 

In TAKES: we put S at position5 and got '-' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? 

Similarly, T must be at4 or5? 

We have words: 
For example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? 
Or "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? 
SEATS is valid? But has S twice? 

"" SEATS "" : positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: A? 
4: T? 
5: S? 

But we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? 

But if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got '-' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be '-'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be 'x'? 

This is complicated? 

Instead, choose a word without repeated letters? 

For example: 
Option1: E in position1: 
Possible words: E ? A ? ?

And ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? 

But we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? 

Letters available: E,A,T,S? and others? 

So E _ A _ _

Must include T and S? And two positions? 

But only two missing letters? 

E (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) 

And T and S must be in there? 

Examples: 
""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? 
""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? 

Word where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). 
But does not include E at1? Only at2? 
But D E A T H: 
Position1: D? We hope E? 

With E at1: ""E'? 
Like ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? 
Or ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? 

Not easy? 

Alternative: E at position2? 

Secret: _ E A _ _

And must include T and S? 

So options: 
Position1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? 

If S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _

Then must contain T? at position4 or5? 

For example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? 

""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? 

Valid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? 

So we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked '- the S that is present but not at position5? 

But we don't care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? 

Then feedback? 

But perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? 

Another common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? 
Positions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? 

"" OASIS ""? O at1? 

"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? 

So hard? 

We know position3 is fixed as A? 

Therefore, guess? 

We cannot force E at1? Because few common words? 

Then try E at position2? 

Similarly? 

Or give up and use a word to test the other letters? 

But we also have K eliminated? 

So let me list all? 

Known:
- Present: A, E, T, S
- Absent: C, R, N, K

Unknown letters: many? 

Also, positions:
- Position3: A (fixed)
- E must be at1 or2? 
- T must be at2,4,5? 
- S must be at1,2,4? 

And not: T at1? S at5? 

Also, the secret and guess: 

Possible next guess: include both T and S and E? 

But E at position2? For example? 

Guess at word: let put E at position2? 

Then the word: ? E A ? ?

Also include T and S? 

For example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? 

But we cannot: because S must be somewhere? 

"" S E A T T "" not word? 

"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? 
But S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got '-'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? 

Then if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn't have S at5? So feedback: S will get 'x'? Or '-'? 
If secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get '-'? But and S at position1? 

H""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? 
We have position3: A? So part fits? 

Also, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? 

Moreover, S at5? We know S isn't at5? So it would get '-' in feedback? But also, T at4? 

This is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? 

Then we get feedback? 

But it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? 

Or we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? 

Or ""FEATS"": F E A T S? 

Or ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got '-' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? 

So ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? 

Therefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? 

Also, not having repeated? 

BEATS: 
- B new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3? 
- T at4? 
- S at5? 

We know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be '-'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? 

Similarly, the only new letter is B? 

To maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? 

Or we can make a guess that tests E at position1? 

How about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? 

Perhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? 

Our priority: determine E's position? Either at1 or2? 

So best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it's there? If not, must be at2? 

So let's try E at1? 

Word: E _ A _ _

Also include T and S? and avoid S at5? 

So E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? 

Guess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? 

""E S A T S"" not? 

""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? 

""E S A B T"" not? 

"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? 

Perhaps not? 

Use: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? 

""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? 

""E X A M P"" not? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? 

Must include? 

But perhaps we can make a guess that doesn't have both? But that would miss one? 

But we know S and T are present? So if we don't include, we get no info? 

So include both? 

 Therefore, back to E at position2? 

Then Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? 
- L at1: new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3?
- S at4? (testing? 
- T at5? 

But T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? 

And S at4? 

Also, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? 

Then this word? LEAST: 
1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? 

If E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? 

Similarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? 

We can choose a word with common letters? 

Or ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? 

So ""LEAST"" might be good? 

Then after guess: 

If E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? 

So guess: ""LEAST"" 

<guess>LEAST</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from two guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  
  - K is not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  
- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  
- **Positional constraints:**  
  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  
  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  
  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  
- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  
- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  
- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  
  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  
  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  
  - L at position 1 (new letter).  
  - A at position 3 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down E's position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.

<guess>LEAST</guess>",LEAST,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - C, R, N: not in the word.
   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - E: in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   Interpretation:
   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.
   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? 
     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). 
     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?
     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.

Rethink: 
The first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.
But second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn't make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that's against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?

Check the words:
- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: 
Breaking down:
CRANE: 
C is position 1? 
R is position 2? 
But feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
Wait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: 
C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? 

I think I miscounted positions? 

Typically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

But the feedback for CRANE: 
C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
So A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? 
Similarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.

But then in TAKES: 
TAKES: 
T (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)

Feedback: 
T(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?
A(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? 
But wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?

No: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? 

Now, in TAKES, we put:
Position 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? 
Position 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? 
But we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? 
Similarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? 
E at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? 
S at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?

So from first guess: 
- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? 
- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? 

Second guess: 
- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? 
- A at position 2: '-' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that's correct? 
- K: x? So K is not in the word? 
- E at position 4: '-' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? 
- S at position 5: '-' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? 

Moreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: 
First guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? 

From second guess: 
If E at position 4 is '-' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? 

Also, S is present? But not at position 5? 
T is present? But not at position 1? 

Therefore, summary:

Confirmed:
- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)
- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)

Additionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? 

Also, S position: present but not position 5? 
T present but not position 1? 

We also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? 

But E must be at 1 or 2? 

So possibilities: 
Secret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? 
But if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? 
Position 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? 

If E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? 

If E at 2, then position 1: some letter? 

Available letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? 

So the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? 

We have two possibilities: 
Case 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? 
Case 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? 

Now, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? 

Also, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? 

So position 1 must be some letter that we haven't tried yet? Or E? 

Similarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? 

Now, both T and S present? Let me list positions: 
1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? 
Option 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? 
Then position 2: must be a letter? We don't know? Could be T? or S? or another? 
But E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? 

But if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? 
But in TAKES: we put T at position1: got '-' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? 

Similarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? 

Also, we have E at position 2? But then position1? 

But wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? 

Therefore, letters:
- E must be at 1 or 2? 
- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? 
- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? 

Also, we know position3 is A? 

Now, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? 

But TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got '-' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? 

Therefore, possibilities:

Position1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got '-' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? 

Also, we don't know how many letters? But there are 5? 

So: 
Known: 
- Position 3 must be A? 
- E must be at position1 or2? 
- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? 
- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? 

But position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? 

And E must be at1 or2? 

If position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? 
Also position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? 
Similarly, T must be at2,4, or5? 

But position2: could be T or S? 

But wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? 

We need to form a word? 

Options ? 

Also, position4 and5? 

Secret word: 
Position1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? 

But E must be present? and at1 or2? 

So guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? 

But we also have T? 

Possible words? 

For example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don't know? 

Or we can try to include both S and T? 

Possible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? 

Try: ""EASTS""? Not valid? 

Or not: 

Common words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? 

""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got '-' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be '-'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? 

So ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? 

But E must be at1 or2? So E at2? 

So we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? 

But let me test E at1: 

Example: ""EASTS"" not? 

""ETAPE""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? 

Better: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? 

Common: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? 

How about: EASEL? Not? 

""PASTE""? But P is new? 

But let's think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? 

For example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? 

Or ""EASES""? But repeated? 

Better: ""ETALS""? Not word? 

Common word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must have a word that has:
Position3: A?
Position1: E? 
Position2: ? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

And with T and S included? 

Or not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? 

But our guess must be valid? 

So if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _

But E and A? 

Available letters: must include T and S? 

Plus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? 

For example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? 

""ESTAT""? Not? 

""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? 

""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? 

""EAT AS"" not 5? 

Perhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: 
""ETATS""? Not common? 
""ETA S"" not? 

Another: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? 

Better to do E at position2? 

Assume E at position2? Then secret: 
Position1: something? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

Then we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? 
S must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? 

In TAKES: we put S at position5 and got '-' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? 

Similarly, T must be at4 or5? 

We have words: 
For example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? 
Or "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? 
SEATS is valid? But has S twice? 

"" SEATS "" : positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: A? 
4: T? 
5: S? 

But we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? 

But if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got '-' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be '-'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be 'x'? 

This is complicated? 

Instead, choose a word without repeated letters? 

For example: 
Option1: E in position1: 
Possible words: E ? A ? ?

And ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? 

But we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? 

Letters available: E,A,T,S? and others? 

So E _ A _ _

Must include T and S? And two positions? 

But only two missing letters? 

E (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) 

And T and S must be in there? 

Examples: 
""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? 
""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? 

Word where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). 
But does not include E at1? Only at2? 
But D E A T H: 
Position1: D? We hope E? 

With E at1: ""E'? 
Like ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? 
Or ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? 

Not easy? 

Alternative: E at position2? 

Secret: _ E A _ _

And must include T and S? 

So options: 
Position1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? 

If S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _

Then must contain T? at position4 or5? 

For example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? 

""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? 

Valid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? 

So we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked '- the S that is present but not at position5? 

But we don't care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? 

Then feedback? 

But perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? 

Another common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? 
Positions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? 

"" OASIS ""? O at1? 

"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? 

So hard? 

We know position3 is fixed as A? 

Therefore, guess? 

We cannot force E at1? Because few common words? 

Then try E at position2? 

Similarly? 

Or give up and use a word to test the other letters? 

But we also have K eliminated? 

So let me list all? 

Known:
- Present: A, E, T, S
- Absent: C, R, N, K

Unknown letters: many? 

Also, positions:
- Position3: A (fixed)
- E must be at1 or2? 
- T must be at2,4,5? 
- S must be at1,2,4? 

And not: T at1? S at5? 

Also, the secret and guess: 

Possible next guess: include both T and S and E? 

But E at position2? For example? 

Guess at word: let put E at position2? 

Then the word: ? E A ? ?

Also include T and S? 

For example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? 

But we cannot: because S must be somewhere? 

"" S E A T T "" not word? 

"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? 
But S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got '-'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? 

Then if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn't have S at5? So feedback: S will get 'x'? Or '-'? 
If secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get '-'? But and S at position1? 

H""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? 
We have position3: A? So part fits? 

Also, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? 

Moreover, S at5? We know S isn't at5? So it would get '-' in feedback? But also, T at4? 

This is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? 

Then we get feedback? 

But it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? 

Or we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? 

Or ""FEATS"": F E A T S? 

Or ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got '-' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? 

So ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? 

Therefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? 

Also, not having repeated? 

BEATS: 
- B new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3? 
- T at4? 
- S at5? 

We know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be '-'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? 

Similarly, the only new letter is B? 

To maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? 

Or we can make a guess that tests E at position1? 

How about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? 

Perhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? 

Our priority: determine E's position? Either at1 or2? 

So best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it's there? If not, must be at2? 

So let's try E at1? 

Word: E _ A _ _

Also include T and S? and avoid S at5? 

So E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? 

Guess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? 

""E S A T S"" not? 

""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? 

""E S A B T"" not? 

"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? 

Perhaps not? 

Use: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? 

""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? 

""E X A M P"" not? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? 

Must include? 

But perhaps we can make a guess that doesn't have both? But that would miss one? 

But we know S and T are present? So if we don't include, we get no info? 

So include both? 

 Therefore, back to E at position2? 

Then Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? 
- L at1: new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3?
- S at4? (testing? 
- T at5? 

But T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? 

And S at4? 

Also, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? 

Then this word? LEAST: 
1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? 

If E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? 

Similarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? 

We can choose a word with common letters? 

Or ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? 

So ""LEAST"" might be good? 

Then after guess: 

If E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? 

So guess: ""LEAST"" 

<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  
  - K is not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  
- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  
- **Positional constraints:**  
  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  
  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  
  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  
- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  
- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  
- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  
  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  
  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  
  - L at position 1 (new letter).  
  - A at position 3 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down E's position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.",Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,yeast,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get for the next guess.
 A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. But note: we can also consider others. Another good starter is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for now.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter is A (position 2 is A).
2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Must have A in the second position.
- Must not include C, R, or N.

We can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.

Let's think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _

And we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.

But note: not in the fifth position because it got a '-' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must also avoid C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.

Examples:
- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won't be correct. But we don't know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.

But note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try to find words that have:
- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.

Also avoiding C, R, N.

Common words:
- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.

Avoiding C, R, N.

So ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.

""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.

We need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That's not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.

Pattern: _ A _ _ _

So:
- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.

Common words:
- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That's position 5? But we know E isn't position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn't have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show '-' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.

Actually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.

But we can also try words that don't put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be '-' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.

Let's avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn't give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don't know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it's still present? But '-' means it's present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won't add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.

But we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.

But we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.

List tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.

We can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.

""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don't know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don't know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn't at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.

""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.

So let's find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.

For example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don't mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don't know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don't know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn't be? We got E at 5 as '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won't be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we'll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: '-'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show '-'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got '-' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We'll get more info.

But EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".

But ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.

<guess>TAKES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - C, R, N: not in the word.
   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - E: in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   Interpretation:
   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.
   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? 
     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). 
     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?
     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.

Rethink: 
The first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.
But second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn't make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that's against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?

Check the words:
- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: 
Breaking down:
CRANE: 
C is position 1? 
R is position 2? 
But feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
Wait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: 
C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? 

I think I miscounted positions? 

Typically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

But the feedback for CRANE: 
C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
So A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? 
Similarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.

But then in TAKES: 
TAKES: 
T (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)

Feedback: 
T(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?
A(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? 
But wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?

No: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? 

Now, in TAKES, we put:
Position 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? 
Position 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? 
But we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? 
Similarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? 
E at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? 
S at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?

So from first guess: 
- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? 
- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? 

Second guess: 
- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? 
- A at position 2: '-' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that's correct? 
- K: x? So K is not in the word? 
- E at position 4: '-' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? 
- S at position 5: '-' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? 

Moreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: 
First guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? 

From second guess: 
If E at position 4 is '-' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? 

Also, S is present? But not at position 5? 
T is present? But not at position 1? 

Therefore, summary:

Confirmed:
- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)
- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)

Additionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? 

Also, S position: present but not position 5? 
T present but not position 1? 

We also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? 

But E must be at 1 or 2? 

So possibilities: 
Secret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? 
But if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? 
Position 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? 

If E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? 

If E at 2, then position 1: some letter? 

Available letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? 

So the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? 

We have two possibilities: 
Case 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? 
Case 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? 

Now, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? 

Also, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? 

So position 1 must be some letter that we haven't tried yet? Or E? 

Similarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? 

Now, both T and S present? Let me list positions: 
1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? 
Option 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? 
Then position 2: must be a letter? We don't know? Could be T? or S? or another? 
But E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? 

But if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? 
But in TAKES: we put T at position1: got '-' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? 

Similarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? 

Also, we have E at position 2? But then position1? 

But wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? 

Therefore, letters:
- E must be at 1 or 2? 
- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? 
- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? 

Also, we know position3 is A? 

Now, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? 

But TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got '-' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? 

Therefore, possibilities:

Position1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got '-' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? 

Also, we don't know how many letters? But there are 5? 

So: 
Known: 
- Position 3 must be A? 
- E must be at position1 or2? 
- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? 
- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? 

But position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? 

And E must be at1 or2? 

If position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? 
Also position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? 
Similarly, T must be at2,4, or5? 

But position2: could be T or S? 

But wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? 

We need to form a word? 

Options ? 

Also, position4 and5? 

Secret word: 
Position1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? 

But E must be present? and at1 or2? 

So guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? 

But we also have T? 

Possible words? 

For example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don't know? 

Or we can try to include both S and T? 

Possible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? 

Try: ""EASTS""? Not valid? 

Or not: 

Common words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? 

""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got '-' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be '-'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? 

So ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? 

But E must be at1 or2? So E at2? 

So we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? 

But let me test E at1: 

Example: ""EASTS"" not? 

""ETAPE""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? 

Better: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? 

Common: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? 

How about: EASEL? Not? 

""PASTE""? But P is new? 

But let's think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? 

For example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? 

Or ""EASES""? But repeated? 

Better: ""ETALS""? Not word? 

Common word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must have a word that has:
Position3: A?
Position1: E? 
Position2: ? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

And with T and S included? 

Or not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? 

But our guess must be valid? 

So if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _

But E and A? 

Available letters: must include T and S? 

Plus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? 

For example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? 

""ESTAT""? Not? 

""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? 

""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? 

""EAT AS"" not 5? 

Perhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: 
""ETATS""? Not common? 
""ETA S"" not? 

Another: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? 

Better to do E at position2? 

Assume E at position2? Then secret: 
Position1: something? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

Then we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? 
S must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? 

In TAKES: we put S at position5 and got '-' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? 

Similarly, T must be at4 or5? 

We have words: 
For example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? 
Or "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? 
SEATS is valid? But has S twice? 

"" SEATS "" : positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: A? 
4: T? 
5: S? 

But we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? 

But if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got '-' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be '-'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be 'x'? 

This is complicated? 

Instead, choose a word without repeated letters? 

For example: 
Option1: E in position1: 
Possible words: E ? A ? ?

And ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? 

But we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? 

Letters available: E,A,T,S? and others? 

So E _ A _ _

Must include T and S? And two positions? 

But only two missing letters? 

E (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) 

And T and S must be in there? 

Examples: 
""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? 
""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? 

Word where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). 
But does not include E at1? Only at2? 
But D E A T H: 
Position1: D? We hope E? 

With E at1: ""E'? 
Like ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? 
Or ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? 

Not easy? 

Alternative: E at position2? 

Secret: _ E A _ _

And must include T and S? 

So options: 
Position1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? 

If S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _

Then must contain T? at position4 or5? 

For example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? 

""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? 

Valid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? 

So we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked '- the S that is present but not at position5? 

But we don't care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? 

Then feedback? 

But perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? 

Another common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? 
Positions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? 

"" OASIS ""? O at1? 

"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? 

So hard? 

We know position3 is fixed as A? 

Therefore, guess? 

We cannot force E at1? Because few common words? 

Then try E at position2? 

Similarly? 

Or give up and use a word to test the other letters? 

But we also have K eliminated? 

So let me list all? 

Known:
- Present: A, E, T, S
- Absent: C, R, N, K

Unknown letters: many? 

Also, positions:
- Position3: A (fixed)
- E must be at1 or2? 
- T must be at2,4,5? 
- S must be at1,2,4? 

And not: T at1? S at5? 

Also, the secret and guess: 

Possible next guess: include both T and S and E? 

But E at position2? For example? 

Guess at word: let put E at position2? 

Then the word: ? E A ? ?

Also include T and S? 

For example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? 

But we cannot: because S must be somewhere? 

"" S E A T T "" not word? 

"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? 
But S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got '-'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? 

Then if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn't have S at5? So feedback: S will get 'x'? Or '-'? 
If secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get '-'? But and S at position1? 

H""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? 
We have position3: A? So part fits? 

Also, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? 

Moreover, S at5? We know S isn't at5? So it would get '-' in feedback? But also, T at4? 

This is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? 

Then we get feedback? 

But it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? 

Or we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? 

Or ""FEATS"": F E A T S? 

Or ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got '-' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? 

So ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? 

Therefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? 

Also, not having repeated? 

BEATS: 
- B new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3? 
- T at4? 
- S at5? 

We know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be '-'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? 

Similarly, the only new letter is B? 

To maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? 

Or we can make a guess that tests E at position1? 

How about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? 

Perhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? 

Our priority: determine E's position? Either at1 or2? 

So best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it's there? If not, must be at2? 

So let's try E at1? 

Word: E _ A _ _

Also include T and S? and avoid S at5? 

So E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? 

Guess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? 

""E S A T S"" not? 

""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? 

""E S A B T"" not? 

"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? 

Perhaps not? 

Use: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? 

""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? 

""E X A M P"" not? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? 

Must include? 

But perhaps we can make a guess that doesn't have both? But that would miss one? 

But we know S and T are present? So if we don't include, we get no info? 

So include both? 

 Therefore, back to E at position2? 

Then Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? 
- L at1: new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3?
- S at4? (testing? 
- T at5? 

But T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? 

And S at4? 

Also, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? 

Then this word? LEAST: 
1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? 

If E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? 

Similarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? 

We can choose a word with common letters? 

Or ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? 

So ""LEAST"" might be good? 

Then after guess: 

If E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? 

So guess: ""LEAST"" 

<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  
  - K is not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  
- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  
- **Positional constraints:**  
  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  
  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  
  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  
- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  
- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  
- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  
  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  
  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  
  - L at position 1 (new letter).  
  - A at position 3 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down E's position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.

The second letter is A (position 2 is A).\n2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).\n3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a second guess that:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word.\n- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.\n- Must have A in the second position.\n- Must not include C, R, or N.\n\nWe can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.\n\nBut note: not in the fifth position because it got a \'-\' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must also avoid C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won\'t be correct. But we don\'t know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.\n\nBut note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to find words that have:\n- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.\n\nAlso avoiding C, R, N.\n\nCommon words:\n- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N.\n\nSo ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.\n\n""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.\n\nWe need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That\'s not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.\n\nPattern: _ A _ _ _\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That\'s position 5? But we know E isn\'t position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn\'t have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show \'-\' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.\n\nActually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.\n\nBut we can also try words that don\'t put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be \'-\' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.\n\nLet\'s avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn\'t give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don\'t know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it\'s still present? But \'-\' means it\'s present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won\'t add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.\n\nBut we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.\n\nList tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.\n\nWe can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.\n\n""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don\'t know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don\'t mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don\'t know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don\'t know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn\'t be? We got E at 5 as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won\'t be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we\'ll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: \'-\'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show \'-\'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got \'-\' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We\'ll get more info.\n\nBut EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".\n\nBut ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.\n\nTypically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E\'s might be marked correctly? And the other one might be \'x\'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E\'s? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don\'t know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.\n\nAnother word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.\n\nBut is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.\n\nOther words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.\n\nBut we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.\n\nCan we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn\'t at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get \'-\' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.\n\nBetter to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.\n\nSo let\'s prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.\n\n""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.\n\n""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.\n\nHow about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.\n\nWith E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.\n\nWith E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.\n\n""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.\n\n""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?\n\nIt\'s a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.\n\nIt fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".\n\nBut perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it\'s first? But ""TAKES"" doesn\'t have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.\n\nTherefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don\'t, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we\'ll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.\n\nThus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.\n\nIf E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, \'-\' or x? But \'-\' if it\'s somewhere? Actually, \'-\' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nAnd with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.\n\nMoreover, K and S are common enough? So that\'s a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the secret word (x).\n- R is not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).\n- N is not in the secret word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).\n\nFor the second guess, I aim to:\n1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.\n2. Keep A in the second position.\n3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).\n4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:\n- T at position 1 (new letter to test).\n- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).\n- K at position 3 (new letter to test).\n- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).\n- S at position 5 (new letter to test).\n\nThis guess allows us to test E\'s position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.\n\n<guess>TAKES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - C, R, N: not in the word.\n   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n   - E: in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.\n   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? \n     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). \n     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?\n     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.\n\nRethink: \nThe first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.\nBut second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn\'t make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that\'s against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?\n\nCheck the words:\n- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: \nBreaking down:\nCRANE: \nC is position 1? \nR is position 2? \nBut feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nWait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: \nC (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? \n\nI think I miscounted positions? \n\nTypically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: E\n\nBut the feedback for CRANE: \nC(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nSo A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? \nSimilarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.\n\nBut then in TAKES: \nTAKES: \nT (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)\n\nFeedback: \nT(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?\nA(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? \nBut wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?\n\nNo: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? \n\nNow, in TAKES, we put:\nPosition 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? \nPosition 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? \nBut we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? \nSimilarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? \nE at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? \nS at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?\n\nSo from first guess: \n- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? \n- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? \n\nSecond guess: \n- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? \n- A at position 2: \'-\' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that\'s correct? \n- K: x? So K is not in the word? \n- E at position 4: \'-\' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? \n- S at position 5: \'-\' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? \n\nMoreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: \nFirst guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? \n\nFrom second guess: \nIf E at position 4 is \'-\' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? \n\nAlso, S is present? But not at position 5? \nT is present? But not at position 1? \n\nTherefore, summary:\n\nConfirmed:\n- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)\n- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S\n\nLetters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? \n\nAlso, S position: present but not position 5? \nT present but not position 1? \n\nWe also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nSo possibilities: \nSecret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? \nBut if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? \nPosition 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nIf E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? \n\nIf E at 2, then position 1: some letter? \n\nAvailable letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? \n\nSo the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? \n\nWe have two possibilities: \nCase 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? \nCase 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? \n\nNow, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? \n\nAlso, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? \n\nSo position 1 must be some letter that we haven\'t tried yet? Or E? \n\nSimilarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? \n\nNow, both T and S present? Let me list positions: \n1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? \nOption 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? \nThen position 2: must be a letter? We don\'t know? Could be T? or S? or another? \nBut E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? \n\nBut if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? \nBut in TAKES: we put T at position1: got \'-\' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? \n\nSimilarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? \n\nAlso, we have E at position 2? But then position1? \n\nBut wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? \n\nTherefore, letters:\n- E must be at 1 or 2? \n- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? \n- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? \n\nAlso, we know position3 is A? \n\nNow, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? \n\nBut TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got \'-\' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? \n\nTherefore, possibilities:\n\nPosition1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got \'-\' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know how many letters? But there are 5? \n\nSo: \nKnown: \n- Position 3 must be A? \n- E must be at position1 or2? \n- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? \n- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? \n\nBut position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? \n\nAnd E must be at1 or2? \n\nIf position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? \nAlso position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? \nSimilarly, T must be at2,4, or5? \n\nBut position2: could be T or S? \n\nBut wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? \n\nWe need to form a word? \n\nOptions ? \n\nAlso, position4 and5? \n\nSecret word: \nPosition1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? \n\nBut E must be present? and at1 or2? \n\nSo guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? \n\nBut we also have T? \n\nPossible words? \n\nFor example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don\'t know? \n\nOr we can try to include both S and T? \n\nPossible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? \n\nTry: ""EASTS""? Not valid? \n\nOr not: \n\nCommon words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? \n\n""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got \'-\' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be \'-\'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? \n\nSo ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? \n\nBut E must be at1 or2? So E at2? \n\nSo we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? \n\nBut let me test E at1: \n\nExample: ""EASTS"" not? \n\n""ETAPE""? Not common? \n\nAnother: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? \n\nBetter: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? \n\nCommon: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? \n\nHow about: EASEL? Not? \n\n""PASTE""? But P is new? \n\nBut let\'s think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? \n\nFor example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? \n\nOr ""EASES""? But repeated? \n\nBetter: ""ETALS""? Not word? \n\nCommon word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? \n\nTherefore, we must have a word that has:\nPosition3: A?\nPosition1: E? \nPosition2: ? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nAnd with T and S included? \n\nOr not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? \n\nBut our guess must be valid? \n\nSo if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _\n\nBut E and A? \n\nAvailable letters: must include T and S? \n\nPlus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? \n\nFor example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? \n\n""ESTAT""? Not? \n\n""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? \n\n""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? \n\n""EAT AS"" not 5? \n\nPerhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: \n""ETATS""? Not common? \n""ETA S"" not? \n\nAnother: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? \n\nBetter to do E at position2? \n\nAssume E at position2? Then secret: \nPosition1: something? \nPosition2: E? \nPosition3: A? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nThen we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? \nS must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? \n\nIn TAKES: we put S at position5 and got \'-\' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? \n\nSimilarly, T must be at4 or5? \n\nWe have words: \nFor example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? \nOr "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? \nSEATS is valid? But has S twice? \n\n"" SEATS "" : positions: \n1: S? \n2: E? \n3: A? \n4: T? \n5: S? \n\nBut we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? \n\nBut if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got \'-\' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be \'-\'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be \'x\'? \n\nThis is complicated? \n\nInstead, choose a word without repeated letters? \n\nFor example: \nOption1: E in position1: \nPossible words: E ? A ? ?\n\nAnd ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? \n\nBut we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? \n\nLetters available: E,A,T,S? and others? \n\nSo E _ A _ _\n\nMust include T and S? And two positions? \n\nBut only two missing letters? \n\nE (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) \n\nAnd T and S must be in there? \n\nExamples: \n""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? \n""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? \n\nWord where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). \nBut does not include E at1? Only at2? \nBut D E A T H: \nPosition1: D? We hope E? \n\nWith E at1: ""E\'? \nLike ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? \nOr ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? \n\nNot easy? \n\nAlternative: E at position2? \n\nSecret: _ E A _ _\n\nAnd must include T and S? \n\nSo options: \nPosition1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? \n\nIf S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _\n\nThen must contain T? at position4 or5? \n\nFor example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? \n\n""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? \n\nValid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? \n\nSo we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked \'- the S that is present but not at position5? \n\nBut we don\'t care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? \n\nThen feedback? \n\nBut perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? \n\nAnother common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? \nPositions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? \n\n"" OASIS ""? O at1? \n\n"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? \n\nSo hard? \n\nWe know position3 is fixed as A? \n\nTherefore, guess? \n\nWe cannot force E at1? Because few common words? \n\nThen try E at position2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOr give up and use a word to test the other letters? \n\nBut we also have K eliminated? \n\nSo let me list all? \n\nKnown:\n- Present: A, E, T, S\n- Absent: C, R, N, K\n\nUnknown letters: many? \n\nAlso, positions:\n- Position3: A (fixed)\n- E must be at1 or2? \n- T must be at2,4,5? \n- S must be at1,2,4? \n\nAnd not: T at1? S at5? \n\nAlso, the secret and guess: \n\nPossible next guess: include both T and S and E? \n\nBut E at position2? For example? \n\nGuess at word: let put E at position2? \n\nThen the word: ? E A ? ?\n\nAlso include T and S? \n\nFor example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? \n\nBut we cannot: because S must be somewhere? \n\n"" S E A T T "" not word? \n\n"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? \nBut S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got \'-\'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? \n\nThen if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn\'t have S at5? So feedback: S will get \'x\'? Or \'-\'? \nIf secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get \'-\'? But and S at position1? \n\nH""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? \nWe have position3: A? So part fits? \n\nAlso, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? \n\nMoreover, S at5? We know S isn\'t at5? So it would get \'-\' in feedback? But also, T at4? \n\nThis is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? \n\nThen we get feedback? \n\nBut it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? \n\nOr we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? \n\nOr ""FEATS"": F E A T S? \n\nOr ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got \'-\' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? \n\nSo ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? \n\nTherefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? \n\nAlso, not having repeated? \n\nBEATS: \n- B new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3? \n- T at4? \n- S at5? \n\nWe know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be \'-\'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? \n\nSimilarly, the only new letter is B? \n\nTo maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? \n\nOr we can make a guess that tests E at position1? \n\nHow about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? \n\nPerhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? \n\nOur priority: determine E\'s position? Either at1 or2? \n\nSo best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it\'s there? If not, must be at2? \n\nSo let\'s try E at1? \n\nWord: E _ A _ _\n\nAlso include T and S? and avoid S at5? \n\nSo E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? \n\nGuess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? \n\n""E S A T S"" not? \n\n""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? \n\n""E S A B T"" not? \n\n"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? \n\nPerhaps not? \n\nUse: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? \n\n""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? \n\n""E X A M P"" not? \n\nHard? \n\nAnother possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? \n\nMust include? \n\nBut perhaps we can make a guess that doesn\'t have both? But that would miss one? \n\nBut we know S and T are present? So if we don\'t include, we get no info? \n\nSo include both? \n\n Therefore, back to E at position2? \n\nThen Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? \n- L at1: new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3?\n- S at4? (testing? \n- T at5? \n\nBut T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? \n\nAnd S at4? \n\nAlso, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? \n\nThen this word? LEAST: \n1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? \n\nIf E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? \n\nSimilarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? \n\nWe can choose a word with common letters? \n\nOr ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? \n\nSo ""LEAST"" might be good? \n\nThen after guess: \n\nIf E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? \n\nSo guess: ""LEAST"" \n\n<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  \n  - C, R, N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  \n  - K is not in the word.  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - S is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  \n- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  \n- **Positional constraints:**  \n  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  \n  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  \n  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  \n- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  \n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  \n- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  \n- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  \n  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  \n  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  \n  - L at position 1 (new letter).  \n  - A at position 3 (fixed).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down E\'s position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.\n\n<guess>LEAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Interpretation: 
     - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.
     - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   - Interpretation:
     - T is in the word but not in position 1.
     - A is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know A is at position 3).
     - K is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. Guess 3: LEAST -> Feedback: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation:
     - L is not in the word.
     - E is in the correct position (position 2? Let's check the word).
     - A is in the correct position (position 3).
     - S is in the correct position (position 4).
     - T is in the correct position (position 5).

Now, let's analyze the word LEAST:
- Positions: 
  - 1: L -> x (not in word)
  - 2: E -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 3: A -> ✓ (correct position, we already knew this)
  - 4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 5: T -> ✓ (correct position)

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: E (from E(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 3: A (known from CRANE and confirmed)
  - Position 4: S (from S(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 5: T (from T(✓) in LEAST)

We also know position 1 must be filled because we have positions 2-5 determined.

Recall from previous feedback:
- E must be in the word, and we have it at position 2. (From LEAST feedback, E at 2 is correct, which matches the constraint that E was at 1 or 2? Now we know it is at 2.)
- From CRANE: E was at position 5 and got (-), so E is not at position 5, which is consistent (now E is at 2).
- From TAKES: T was at position 1? We put T at 1 in TAKES and got (-), meaning T is not at position 1? But now we see T at position 5? So yes, T is at position 5? 
- Similarly, in TAKES: S was at position 5 and got (-), meaning S is not at position 5? But now we have S at position 4? So it is consistent? 

So the secret word so far: ? E A S T

We know the first letter is missing, and we must guess it.

What do we know about the first letter?
- It cannot be: C, R, N, K, L (from the x feedback in previous guesses).
- We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K, S, L (from guesses).

The first letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is in the word? But we don't know any other letters? Because the word is 5 letters? And we have four: E, A, S, T? And one missing.

From the feedback, we don't have any other letters? Because:
- The word is exactly ? E A S T? 
- And we know that the word contains E, A, S, T? And the first letter? 

But from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is in word? But we didn't have the position? Similarly, T and S were missing? 

But now with LEAST: we matched E, A, S, T? So the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed? And it must complete a valid English word? 

Letters eliminated: C, R, N, K, L? 

We haven't guessed many vowels? Or other consonants? 

What are possible words that end with ""EAST""? 

Common ones: 
- BEAST
- FEAST? But FEAST is F E A S T? 
- YEART? Not? 
- HEART? But R is eliminated? 
- Only words like BEAST, FEAST? 

BEAST: B E A S T? 
FEAST: F E A S T? 
PEAST? Not common? 

Also, from the elimination: 
- R is not? So no HEART? 

What about WORLD? Not. 

So possible first letters: 
B, F, etc? 

But we haven't tested B or F? 

We can just guess one of them? 

But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 4? So we can try? 

But let me list all possibilities? 

Possible words:
- BEAST: B E A S T
- FEAST: F E A S T
- HEAST? Not common? 
- GEAST? No
- VEAST? No
- PEAST? Not common?
- etc. 

Common ones are BEAST and FEAST? 

We can guess BEAST? If it is not? Then next? 

But how to decide? 

We have no feedback on B or F? 

Also note: from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is present? That was satisfied. 

Similarly, we have T and S? 

We can also consider if there are other possibilities? 

For example, words like ""LEAST"" itself? But we guessed LEAST and got L(x)? So L is not? Therefore, LEAST cannot be the word? 

We are missing the first letter? So ""LEAST"" was our guess? And we got E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) but L(x)? So the word is not LEAST? 

Similarly, it must be ?EAST? 

So guess BEAST? 

If we guess BEAST: 
- If correct, we win? 
- If not, then likely FEAST? 

But to be sure? We can guess BEAST? 

But also, perhaps there is other? Or we might lose a try? But two options? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

Is there any word like MEAST? Not common? 

So probably BEAST or FEAST? 

We can guess one of them? 

Let's guess BEAST? 

Because B is common? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But wait: in our previous guess LEAST, we have E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) and L(x)? 

So for BEAST: 
- Position1: B? 
- Position2: E? (we know E is at2? So it should be ✓? 
- Position3: A? ✓ 
- Position4: S? ✓ 
- Position5: T? ✓ 

Then the feedback will tell? 

If it is BEAST, all ✓? 

If not, then we get B(x) and then we know it's FEAST? 

We have two tries left? So safe? 

Therefore, guess BEAST? 

But is BEAST a valid word? Yes? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But note: we don't know if B is present? But it could be? 

So yes? 

We can do that? 

Alternatively, is there any elimination? 

From TAKES: we had A at position2? Got A(-)? But that was because A is at position3? Not because the first letter? 

So no additional info? 

Therefore, guess ""BEAST""

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get for the next guess.
 A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. But note: we can also consider others. Another good starter is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for now.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter is A (position 2 is A).
2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Must have A in the second position.
- Must not include C, R, or N.

We can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.

Let's think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _

And we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.

But note: not in the fifth position because it got a '-' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must also avoid C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.

Examples:
- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won't be correct. But we don't know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.

But note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try to find words that have:
- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.

Also avoiding C, R, N.

Common words:
- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.

Avoiding C, R, N.

So ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.

""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.

We need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That's not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.

Pattern: _ A _ _ _

So:
- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.

Common words:
- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That's position 5? But we know E isn't position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn't have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show '-' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.

Actually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.

But we can also try words that don't put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be '-' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.

Let's avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn't give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don't know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it's still present? But '-' means it's present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won't add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.

But we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.

But we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.

List tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.

We can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.

""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don't know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don't know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn't at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.

""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.

So let's find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.

For example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don't mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don't know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don't know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn't be? We got E at 5 as '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won't be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we'll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: '-'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show '-'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got '-' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We'll get more info.

But EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".

But ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.

<guess>TAKES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - C, R, N: not in the word.
   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - E: in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   Interpretation:
   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.
   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? 
     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). 
     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?
     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.

Rethink: 
The first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.
But second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn't make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that's against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?

Check the words:
- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: 
Breaking down:
CRANE: 
C is position 1? 
R is position 2? 
But feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
Wait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: 
C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? 

I think I miscounted positions? 

Typically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

But the feedback for CRANE: 
C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
So A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? 
Similarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.

But then in TAKES: 
TAKES: 
T (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)

Feedback: 
T(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?
A(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? 
But wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?

No: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? 

Now, in TAKES, we put:
Position 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? 
Position 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? 
But we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? 
Similarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? 
E at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? 
S at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?

So from first guess: 
- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? 
- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? 

Second guess: 
- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? 
- A at position 2: '-' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that's correct? 
- K: x? So K is not in the word? 
- E at position 4: '-' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? 
- S at position 5: '-' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? 

Moreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: 
First guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? 

From second guess: 
If E at position 4 is '-' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? 

Also, S is present? But not at position 5? 
T is present? But not at position 1? 

Therefore, summary:

Confirmed:
- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)
- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)

Additionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? 

Also, S position: present but not position 5? 
T present but not position 1? 

We also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? 

But E must be at 1 or 2? 

So possibilities: 
Secret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? 
But if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? 
Position 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? 

If E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? 

If E at 2, then position 1: some letter? 

Available letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? 

So the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? 

We have two possibilities: 
Case 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? 
Case 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? 

Now, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? 

Also, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? 

So position 1 must be some letter that we haven't tried yet? Or E? 

Similarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? 

Now, both T and S present? Let me list positions: 
1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? 
Option 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? 
Then position 2: must be a letter? We don't know? Could be T? or S? or another? 
But E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? 

But if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? 
But in TAKES: we put T at position1: got '-' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? 

Similarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? 

Also, we have E at position 2? But then position1? 

But wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? 

Therefore, letters:
- E must be at 1 or 2? 
- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? 
- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? 

Also, we know position3 is A? 

Now, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? 

But TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got '-' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? 

Therefore, possibilities:

Position1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got '-' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? 

Also, we don't know how many letters? But there are 5? 

So: 
Known: 
- Position 3 must be A? 
- E must be at position1 or2? 
- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? 
- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? 

But position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? 

And E must be at1 or2? 

If position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? 
Also position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? 
Similarly, T must be at2,4, or5? 

But position2: could be T or S? 

But wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? 

We need to form a word? 

Options ? 

Also, position4 and5? 

Secret word: 
Position1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? 

But E must be present? and at1 or2? 

So guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? 

But we also have T? 

Possible words? 

For example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don't know? 

Or we can try to include both S and T? 

Possible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? 

Try: ""EASTS""? Not valid? 

Or not: 

Common words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? 

""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got '-' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be '-'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? 

So ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? 

But E must be at1 or2? So E at2? 

So we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? 

But let me test E at1: 

Example: ""EASTS"" not? 

""ETAPE""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? 

Better: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? 

Common: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? 

How about: EASEL? Not? 

""PASTE""? But P is new? 

But let's think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? 

For example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? 

Or ""EASES""? But repeated? 

Better: ""ETALS""? Not word? 

Common word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must have a word that has:
Position3: A?
Position1: E? 
Position2: ? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

And with T and S included? 

Or not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? 

But our guess must be valid? 

So if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _

But E and A? 

Available letters: must include T and S? 

Plus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? 

For example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? 

""ESTAT""? Not? 

""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? 

""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? 

""EAT AS"" not 5? 

Perhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: 
""ETATS""? Not common? 
""ETA S"" not? 

Another: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? 

Better to do E at position2? 

Assume E at position2? Then secret: 
Position1: something? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

Then we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? 
S must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? 

In TAKES: we put S at position5 and got '-' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? 

Similarly, T must be at4 or5? 

We have words: 
For example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? 
Or "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? 
SEATS is valid? But has S twice? 

"" SEATS "" : positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: A? 
4: T? 
5: S? 

But we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? 

But if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got '-' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be '-'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be 'x'? 

This is complicated? 

Instead, choose a word without repeated letters? 

For example: 
Option1: E in position1: 
Possible words: E ? A ? ?

And ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? 

But we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? 

Letters available: E,A,T,S? and others? 

So E _ A _ _

Must include T and S? And two positions? 

But only two missing letters? 

E (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) 

And T and S must be in there? 

Examples: 
""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? 
""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? 

Word where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). 
But does not include E at1? Only at2? 
But D E A T H: 
Position1: D? We hope E? 

With E at1: ""E'? 
Like ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? 
Or ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? 

Not easy? 

Alternative: E at position2? 

Secret: _ E A _ _

And must include T and S? 

So options: 
Position1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? 

If S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _

Then must contain T? at position4 or5? 

For example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? 

""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? 

Valid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? 

So we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked '- the S that is present but not at position5? 

But we don't care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? 

Then feedback? 

But perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? 

Another common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? 
Positions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? 

"" OASIS ""? O at1? 

"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? 

So hard? 

We know position3 is fixed as A? 

Therefore, guess? 

We cannot force E at1? Because few common words? 

Then try E at position2? 

Similarly? 

Or give up and use a word to test the other letters? 

But we also have K eliminated? 

So let me list all? 

Known:
- Present: A, E, T, S
- Absent: C, R, N, K

Unknown letters: many? 

Also, positions:
- Position3: A (fixed)
- E must be at1 or2? 
- T must be at2,4,5? 
- S must be at1,2,4? 

And not: T at1? S at5? 

Also, the secret and guess: 

Possible next guess: include both T and S and E? 

But E at position2? For example? 

Guess at word: let put E at position2? 

Then the word: ? E A ? ?

Also include T and S? 

For example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? 

But we cannot: because S must be somewhere? 

"" S E A T T "" not word? 

"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? 
But S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got '-'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? 

Then if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn't have S at5? So feedback: S will get 'x'? Or '-'? 
If secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get '-'? But and S at position1? 

H""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? 
We have position3: A? So part fits? 

Also, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? 

Moreover, S at5? We know S isn't at5? So it would get '-' in feedback? But also, T at4? 

This is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? 

Then we get feedback? 

But it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? 

Or we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? 

Or ""FEATS"": F E A T S? 

Or ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got '-' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? 

So ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? 

Therefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? 

Also, not having repeated? 

BEATS: 
- B new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3? 
- T at4? 
- S at5? 

We know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be '-'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? 

Similarly, the only new letter is B? 

To maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? 

Or we can make a guess that tests E at position1? 

How about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? 

Perhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? 

Our priority: determine E's position? Either at1 or2? 

So best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it's there? If not, must be at2? 

So let's try E at1? 

Word: E _ A _ _

Also include T and S? and avoid S at5? 

So E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? 

Guess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? 

""E S A T S"" not? 

""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? 

""E S A B T"" not? 

"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? 

Perhaps not? 

Use: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? 

""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? 

""E X A M P"" not? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? 

Must include? 

But perhaps we can make a guess that doesn't have both? But that would miss one? 

But we know S and T are present? So if we don't include, we get no info? 

So include both? 

 Therefore, back to E at position2? 

Then Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? 
- L at1: new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3?
- S at4? (testing? 
- T at5? 

But T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? 

And S at4? 

Also, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? 

Then this word? LEAST: 
1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? 

If E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? 

Similarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? 

We can choose a word with common letters? 

Or ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? 

So ""LEAST"" might be good? 

Then after guess: 

If E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? 

So guess: ""LEAST"" 

<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  
  - K is not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  
- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  
- **Positional constraints:**  
  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  
  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  
  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  
- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  
- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  
- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  
  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  
  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  
  - L at position 1 (new letter).  
  - A at position 3 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down E's position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.

<guess>LEAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Interpretation: 
     - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.
     - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   - Interpretation:
     - T is in the word but not in position 1.
     - A is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know A is at position 3).
     - K is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. Guess 3: LEAST -> Feedback: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation:
     - L is not in the word.
     - E is in the correct position (position 2? Let's check the word).
     - A is in the correct position (position 3).
     - S is in the correct position (position 4).
     - T is in the correct position (position 5).

Now, let's analyze the word LEAST:
- Positions: 
  - 1: L -> x (not in word)
  - 2: E -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 3: A -> ✓ (correct position, we already knew this)
  - 4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 5: T -> ✓ (correct position)

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: E (from E(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 3: A (known from CRANE and confirmed)
  - Position 4: S (from S(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 5: T (from T(✓) in LEAST)

We also know position 1 must be filled because we have positions 2-5 determined.

Recall from previous feedback:
- E must be in the word, and we have it at position 2. (From LEAST feedback, E at 2 is correct, which matches the constraint that E was at 1 or 2? Now we know it is at 2.)
- From CRANE: E was at position 5 and got (-), so E is not at position 5, which is consistent (now E is at 2).
- From TAKES: T was at position 1? We put T at 1 in TAKES and got (-), meaning T is not at position 1? But now we see T at position 5? So yes, T is at position 5? 
- Similarly, in TAKES: S was at position 5 and got (-), meaning S is not at position 5? But now we have S at position 4? So it is consistent? 

So the secret word so far: ? E A S T

We know the first letter is missing, and we must guess it.

What do we know about the first letter?
- It cannot be: C, R, N, K, L (from the x feedback in previous guesses).
- We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K, S, L (from guesses).

The first letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is in the word? But we don't know any other letters? Because the word is 5 letters? And we have four: E, A, S, T? And one missing.

From the feedback, we don't have any other letters? Because:
- The word is exactly ? E A S T? 
- And we know that the word contains E, A, S, T? And the first letter? 

But from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is in word? But we didn't have the position? Similarly, T and S were missing? 

But now with LEAST: we matched E, A, S, T? So the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed? And it must complete a valid English word? 

Letters eliminated: C, R, N, K, L? 

We haven't guessed many vowels? Or other consonants? 

What are possible words that end with ""EAST""? 

Common ones: 
- BEAST
- FEAST? But FEAST is F E A S T? 
- YEART? Not? 
- HEART? But R is eliminated? 
- Only words like BEAST, FEAST? 

BEAST: B E A S T? 
FEAST: F E A S T? 
PEAST? Not common? 

Also, from the elimination: 
- R is not? So no HEART? 

What about WORLD? Not. 

So possible first letters: 
B, F, etc? 

But we haven't tested B or F? 

We can just guess one of them? 

But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 4? So we can try? 

But let me list all possibilities? 

Possible words:
- BEAST: B E A S T
- FEAST: F E A S T
- HEAST? Not common? 
- GEAST? No
- VEAST? No
- PEAST? Not common?
- etc. 

Common ones are BEAST and FEAST? 

We can guess BEAST? If it is not? Then next? 

But how to decide? 

We have no feedback on B or F? 

Also note: from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is present? That was satisfied. 

Similarly, we have T and S? 

We can also consider if there are other possibilities? 

For example, words like ""LEAST"" itself? But we guessed LEAST and got L(x)? So L is not? Therefore, LEAST cannot be the word? 

We are missing the first letter? So ""LEAST"" was our guess? And we got E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) but L(x)? So the word is not LEAST? 

Similarly, it must be ?EAST? 

So guess BEAST? 

If we guess BEAST: 
- If correct, we win? 
- If not, then likely FEAST? 

But to be sure? We can guess BEAST? 

But also, perhaps there is other? Or we might lose a try? But two options? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

Is there any word like MEAST? Not common? 

So probably BEAST or FEAST? 

We can guess one of them? 

Let's guess BEAST? 

Because B is common? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But wait: in our previous guess LEAST, we have E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) and L(x)? 

So for BEAST: 
- Position1: B? 
- Position2: E? (we know E is at2? So it should be ✓? 
- Position3: A? ✓ 
- Position4: S? ✓ 
- Position5: T? ✓ 

Then the feedback will tell? 

If it is BEAST, all ✓? 

If not, then we get B(x) and then we know it's FEAST? 

We have two tries left? So safe? 

Therefore, guess BEAST? 

But is BEAST a valid word? Yes? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But note: we don't know if B is present? But it could be? 

So yes? 

We can do that? 

Alternatively, is there any elimination? 

From TAKES: we had A at position2? Got A(-)? But that was because A is at position3? Not because the first letter? 

So no additional info? 

Therefore, guess ""BEAST"" 

<guess>BEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**  
  Revealed:  
  - Position 3 must be **A** (✓).  
  - **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  
  - C, R, N are not in the word (x).  

- **Guess 2 (TAKES)**  
  Revealed:  
  - **T** is in the word but not at position 1 (-).  
  - **A** is in the word but not at position 2 (-) (redundant with Guess 1).  
  - K is not in the word (x).  
  - **E** is not at position 4 (-).  
  - **S** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  

- **Guess 3 (LEAST)**  
  Revealed:  
  - L is not in the word (x).  
  - **E** is at position 2 (✓).  
  - **A** is at position 3 (✓).  
  - **S** is at position 4 (✓).  
  - **T** is at position 5 (✓).  

### Current Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `{Position 1} E A S T`.  
- Position 1 cannot be **C, R, N, K, L** (eliminated letters).  
- The only common English words are **BEAST** or **FEAST**.  
- Both are valid 5-letter words.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **BEAST** to confirm position 1.
- If incorrect, **FEAST** remains the only logical option (saved for Guess 5 if needed).

The second letter is A (position 2 is A).\n2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).\n3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a second guess that:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word.\n- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.\n- Must have A in the second position.\n- Must not include C, R, or N.\n\nWe can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.\n\nBut note: not in the fifth position because it got a \'-\' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must also avoid C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won\'t be correct. But we don\'t know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.\n\nBut note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to find words that have:\n- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.\n\nAlso avoiding C, R, N.\n\nCommon words:\n- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N.\n\nSo ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.\n\n""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.\n\nWe need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That\'s not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.\n\nPattern: _ A _ _ _\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That\'s position 5? But we know E isn\'t position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn\'t have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show \'-\' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.\n\nActually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.\n\nBut we can also try words that don\'t put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be \'-\' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.\n\nLet\'s avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn\'t give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don\'t know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it\'s still present? But \'-\' means it\'s present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won\'t add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.\n\nBut we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.\n\nList tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.\n\nWe can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.\n\n""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don\'t know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don\'t mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don\'t know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don\'t know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn\'t be? We got E at 5 as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won\'t be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we\'ll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: \'-\'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show \'-\'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got \'-\' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We\'ll get more info.\n\nBut EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".\n\nBut ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.\n\nTypically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E\'s might be marked correctly? And the other one might be \'x\'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E\'s? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don\'t know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.\n\nAnother word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.\n\nBut is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.\n\nOther words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.\n\nBut we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.\n\nCan we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn\'t at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get \'-\' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.\n\nBetter to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.\n\nSo let\'s prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.\n\n""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.\n\n""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.\n\nHow about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.\n\nWith E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.\n\nWith E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.\n\n""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.\n\n""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?\n\nIt\'s a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.\n\nIt fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".\n\nBut perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it\'s first? But ""TAKES"" doesn\'t have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.\n\nTherefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don\'t, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we\'ll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.\n\nThus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.\n\nIf E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, \'-\' or x? But \'-\' if it\'s somewhere? Actually, \'-\' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nAnd with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.\n\nMoreover, K and S are common enough? So that\'s a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the secret word (x).\n- R is not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).\n- N is not in the secret word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).\n\nFor the second guess, I aim to:\n1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.\n2. Keep A in the second position.\n3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).\n4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:\n- T at position 1 (new letter to test).\n- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).\n- K at position 3 (new letter to test).\n- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).\n- S at position 5 (new letter to test).\n\nThis guess allows us to test E\'s position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.\n\n<guess>TAKES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - C, R, N: not in the word.\n   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n   - E: in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.\n   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? \n     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). \n     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?\n     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.\n\nRethink: \nThe first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.\nBut second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn\'t make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that\'s against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?\n\nCheck the words:\n- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: \nBreaking down:\nCRANE: \nC is position 1? \nR is position 2? \nBut feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nWait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: \nC (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? \n\nI think I miscounted positions? \n\nTypically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: E\n\nBut the feedback for CRANE: \nC(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nSo A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? \nSimilarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.\n\nBut then in TAKES: \nTAKES: \nT (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)\n\nFeedback: \nT(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?\nA(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? \nBut wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?\n\nNo: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? \n\nNow, in TAKES, we put:\nPosition 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? \nPosition 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? \nBut we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? \nSimilarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? \nE at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? \nS at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?\n\nSo from first guess: \n- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? \n- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? \n\nSecond guess: \n- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? \n- A at position 2: \'-\' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that\'s correct? \n- K: x? So K is not in the word? \n- E at position 4: \'-\' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? \n- S at position 5: \'-\' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? \n\nMoreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: \nFirst guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? \n\nFrom second guess: \nIf E at position 4 is \'-\' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? \n\nAlso, S is present? But not at position 5? \nT is present? But not at position 1? \n\nTherefore, summary:\n\nConfirmed:\n- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)\n- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S\n\nLetters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? \n\nAlso, S position: present but not position 5? \nT present but not position 1? \n\nWe also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nSo possibilities: \nSecret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? \nBut if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? \nPosition 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nIf E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? \n\nIf E at 2, then position 1: some letter? \n\nAvailable letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? \n\nSo the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? \n\nWe have two possibilities: \nCase 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? \nCase 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? \n\nNow, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? \n\nAlso, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? \n\nSo position 1 must be some letter that we haven\'t tried yet? Or E? \n\nSimilarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? \n\nNow, both T and S present? Let me list positions: \n1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? \nOption 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? \nThen position 2: must be a letter? We don\'t know? Could be T? or S? or another? \nBut E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? \n\nBut if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? \nBut in TAKES: we put T at position1: got \'-\' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? \n\nSimilarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? \n\nAlso, we have E at position 2? But then position1? \n\nBut wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? \n\nTherefore, letters:\n- E must be at 1 or 2? \n- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? \n- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? \n\nAlso, we know position3 is A? \n\nNow, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? \n\nBut TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got \'-\' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? \n\nTherefore, possibilities:\n\nPosition1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got \'-\' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know how many letters? But there are 5? \n\nSo: \nKnown: \n- Position 3 must be A? \n- E must be at position1 or2? \n- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? \n- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? \n\nBut position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? \n\nAnd E must be at1 or2? \n\nIf position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? \nAlso position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? \nSimilarly, T must be at2,4, or5? \n\nBut position2: could be T or S? \n\nBut wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? \n\nWe need to form a word? \n\nOptions ? \n\nAlso, position4 and5? \n\nSecret word: \nPosition1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? \n\nBut E must be present? and at1 or2? \n\nSo guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? \n\nBut we also have T? \n\nPossible words? \n\nFor example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don\'t know? \n\nOr we can try to include both S and T? \n\nPossible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? \n\nTry: ""EASTS""? Not valid? \n\nOr not: \n\nCommon words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? \n\n""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got \'-\' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be \'-\'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? \n\nSo ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? \n\nBut E must be at1 or2? So E at2? \n\nSo we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? \n\nBut let me test E at1: \n\nExample: ""EASTS"" not? \n\n""ETAPE""? Not common? \n\nAnother: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? \n\nBetter: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? \n\nCommon: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? \n\nHow about: EASEL? Not? \n\n""PASTE""? But P is new? \n\nBut let\'s think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? \n\nFor example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? \n\nOr ""EASES""? But repeated? \n\nBetter: ""ETALS""? Not word? \n\nCommon word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? \n\nTherefore, we must have a word that has:\nPosition3: A?\nPosition1: E? \nPosition2: ? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nAnd with T and S included? \n\nOr not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? \n\nBut our guess must be valid? \n\nSo if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _\n\nBut E and A? \n\nAvailable letters: must include T and S? \n\nPlus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? \n\nFor example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? \n\n""ESTAT""? Not? \n\n""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? \n\n""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? \n\n""EAT AS"" not 5? \n\nPerhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: \n""ETATS""? Not common? \n""ETA S"" not? \n\nAnother: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? \n\nBetter to do E at position2? \n\nAssume E at position2? Then secret: \nPosition1: something? \nPosition2: E? \nPosition3: A? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nThen we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? \nS must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? \n\nIn TAKES: we put S at position5 and got \'-\' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? \n\nSimilarly, T must be at4 or5? \n\nWe have words: \nFor example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? \nOr "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? \nSEATS is valid? But has S twice? \n\n"" SEATS "" : positions: \n1: S? \n2: E? \n3: A? \n4: T? \n5: S? \n\nBut we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? \n\nBut if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got \'-\' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be \'-\'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be \'x\'? \n\nThis is complicated? \n\nInstead, choose a word without repeated letters? \n\nFor example: \nOption1: E in position1: \nPossible words: E ? A ? ?\n\nAnd ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? \n\nBut we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? \n\nLetters available: E,A,T,S? and others? \n\nSo E _ A _ _\n\nMust include T and S? And two positions? \n\nBut only two missing letters? \n\nE (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) \n\nAnd T and S must be in there? \n\nExamples: \n""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? \n""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? \n\nWord where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). \nBut does not include E at1? Only at2? \nBut D E A T H: \nPosition1: D? We hope E? \n\nWith E at1: ""E\'? \nLike ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? \nOr ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? \n\nNot easy? \n\nAlternative: E at position2? \n\nSecret: _ E A _ _\n\nAnd must include T and S? \n\nSo options: \nPosition1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? \n\nIf S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _\n\nThen must contain T? at position4 or5? \n\nFor example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? \n\n""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? \n\nValid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? \n\nSo we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked \'- the S that is present but not at position5? \n\nBut we don\'t care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? \n\nThen feedback? \n\nBut perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? \n\nAnother common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? \nPositions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? \n\n"" OASIS ""? O at1? \n\n"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? \n\nSo hard? \n\nWe know position3 is fixed as A? \n\nTherefore, guess? \n\nWe cannot force E at1? Because few common words? \n\nThen try E at position2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOr give up and use a word to test the other letters? \n\nBut we also have K eliminated? \n\nSo let me list all? \n\nKnown:\n- Present: A, E, T, S\n- Absent: C, R, N, K\n\nUnknown letters: many? \n\nAlso, positions:\n- Position3: A (fixed)\n- E must be at1 or2? \n- T must be at2,4,5? \n- S must be at1,2,4? \n\nAnd not: T at1? S at5? \n\nAlso, the secret and guess: \n\nPossible next guess: include both T and S and E? \n\nBut E at position2? For example? \n\nGuess at word: let put E at position2? \n\nThen the word: ? E A ? ?\n\nAlso include T and S? \n\nFor example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? \n\nBut we cannot: because S must be somewhere? \n\n"" S E A T T "" not word? \n\n"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? \nBut S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got \'-\'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? \n\nThen if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn\'t have S at5? So feedback: S will get \'x\'? Or \'-\'? \nIf secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get \'-\'? But and S at position1? \n\nH""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? \nWe have position3: A? So part fits? \n\nAlso, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? \n\nMoreover, S at5? We know S isn\'t at5? So it would get \'-\' in feedback? But also, T at4? \n\nThis is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? \n\nThen we get feedback? \n\nBut it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? \n\nOr we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? \n\nOr ""FEATS"": F E A T S? \n\nOr ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got \'-\' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? \n\nSo ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? \n\nTherefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? \n\nAlso, not having repeated? \n\nBEATS: \n- B new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3? \n- T at4? \n- S at5? \n\nWe know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be \'-\'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? \n\nSimilarly, the only new letter is B? \n\nTo maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? \n\nOr we can make a guess that tests E at position1? \n\nHow about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? \n\nPerhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? \n\nOur priority: determine E\'s position? Either at1 or2? \n\nSo best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it\'s there? If not, must be at2? \n\nSo let\'s try E at1? \n\nWord: E _ A _ _\n\nAlso include T and S? and avoid S at5? \n\nSo E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? \n\nGuess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? \n\n""E S A T S"" not? \n\n""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? \n\n""E S A B T"" not? \n\n"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? \n\nPerhaps not? \n\nUse: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? \n\n""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? \n\n""E X A M P"" not? \n\nHard? \n\nAnother possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? \n\nMust include? \n\nBut perhaps we can make a guess that doesn\'t have both? But that would miss one? \n\nBut we know S and T are present? So if we don\'t include, we get no info? \n\nSo include both? \n\n Therefore, back to E at position2? \n\nThen Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? \n- L at1: new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3?\n- S at4? (testing? \n- T at5? \n\nBut T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? \n\nAnd S at4? \n\nAlso, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? \n\nThen this word? LEAST: \n1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? \n\nIf E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? \n\nSimilarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? \n\nWe can choose a word with common letters? \n\nOr ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? \n\nSo ""LEAST"" might be good? \n\nThen after guess: \n\nIf E is at2?

(From LEAST feedback, E at 2 is correct, which matches the constraint that E was at 1 or 2? Now we know it is at 2.)\n- From CRANE: E was at position 5 and got (-), so E is not at position 5, which is consistent (now E is at 2).\n- From TAKES: T was at position 1? We put T at 1 in TAKES and got (-), meaning T is not at position 1? But now we see T at position 5? So yes, T is at position 5? \n- Similarly, in TAKES: S was at position 5 and got (-), meaning S is not at position 5? But now we have S at position 4? So it is consistent? \n\nSo the secret word so far: ? E A S T\n\nWe know the first letter is missing, and we must guess it.\n\nWhat do we know about the first letter?\n- It cannot be: C, R, N, K, L (from the x feedback in previous guesses).\n- We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K, S, L (from guesses).\n\nThe first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been eliminated and is in the word? But we don\'t know any other letters? Because the word is 5 letters? And we have four: E, A, S, T? And one missing.\n\nFrom the feedback, we don\'t have any other letters? Because:\n- The word is exactly ? E A S T? \n- And we know that the word contains E, A, S, T? And the first letter? \n\nBut from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is in word? But we didn\'t have the position? Similarly, T and S were missing? \n\nBut now with LEAST: we matched E, A, S, T? So the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been guessed? And it must complete a valid English word? \n\nLetters eliminated: C, R, N, K, L? \n\nWe haven\'t guessed many vowels?

So L is not? Therefore, LEAST cannot be the word? \n\nWe are missing the first letter? So ""LEAST"" was our guess? And we got E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) but L(x)? So the word is not LEAST? \n\nSimilarly, it must be ?EAST? \n\nSo guess BEAST? \n\nIf we guess BEAST: \n- If correct, we win? \n- If not, then likely FEAST? \n\nBut to be sure? We can guess BEAST? \n\nBut also, perhaps there is other? Or we might lose a try? But two options? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words? \n\nIs there any word like MEAST? Not common? \n\nSo probably BEAST or FEAST? \n\nWe can guess one of them? \n\nLet\'s guess BEAST? \n\nBecause B is common? \n\nSo next guess: BEAST? \n\nBut wait: in our previous guess LEAST, we have E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) and L(x)? \n\nSo for BEAST: \n- Position1: B? \n- Position2: E? (we know E is at2?

So safe? \n\nTherefore, guess BEAST? \n\nBut is BEAST a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo next guess: BEAST? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B is present? But it could be? \n\nSo yes? \n\nWe can do that? \n\nAlternatively, is there any elimination? \n\nFrom TAKES: we had A at position2? Got A(-)? But that was because A is at position3?

3. Guess 3: LEAST -> Feedback: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation: L is not in the word. E is in the correct position (position 2). A is in the correct position (position 3). S is in the correct position (position 4). T is in the correct position (position 5). So the word has the form: [unknown] E A S T

4. Guess 4: BEAST -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation: B is not in the word. E, A, S, and T are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5). So the secret word is _ E A S T.

From the feedback, the secret word is a 5-letter word ending with ""EAST"". The first letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, K, L, B.

We know the word must end with ""EAST"". Common English words that fit this pattern:
- BEAST (already guessed, and B is eliminated)
- FEAST (F E A S T)
- Other less common words: GEAST? (uncommon), HEAST? (not a word), etc.

Given that BEAST was incorrect (B is not in the word and not the first letter), the only remaining common word is FEAST.

Therefore, we can confidently guess FEAST.

Based on the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)** confirmed:
   - Position 3 is **A** (✓).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,yeast,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information we get for the next guess.
 A common starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. But note: we can also consider others. Another good starter is ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"". However, let's stick with ""CRANE"" for now.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter of the secret word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Therefore, we know:
1. The second letter is A (position 2 is A).
2. The letter E is present in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we got - for E in the fifth spot).
3. The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.
- Must have A in the second position.
- Must not include C, R, or N.

We can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Given the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.

Let's think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Possible words:
- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _

And we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.

But note: not in the fifth position because it got a '-' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must also avoid C, R, N.

Let's try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.

Examples:
- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won't be correct. But we don't know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.

But note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Therefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try to find words that have:
- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.

Also avoiding C, R, N.

Common words:
- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.

Avoiding C, R, N.

So ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.

""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.

We need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.

Another idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That's not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.

Pattern: _ A _ _ _

So:
- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.

Common words:
- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That's position 5? But we know E isn't position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn't have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show '-' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.

Actually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.

But we can also try words that don't put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be '-' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.

Let's avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn't give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don't know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it's still present? But '-' means it's present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won't add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.

But we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.

But we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.

List tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.

We can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

Word suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.

""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.

""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don't know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don't know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn't at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.

""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.

So let's find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.

For example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don't mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don't know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don't know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn't be? We got E at 5 as '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won't be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we'll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: '-'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show '-'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got '-' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We'll get more info.

But EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".

But ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.

Typically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E's might be marked correctly? And the other one might be 'x'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E's? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.

Therefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don't know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.

Another word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.

But is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.

Other words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.

But we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.

Can we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn't at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get '-' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.

Better to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.

So let's prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.

""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.

""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.

How about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.

With E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.

With E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.

""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.

Another: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.

""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?

It's a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.

It fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".

But perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it's first? But ""TAKES"" doesn't have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.

Therefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Another word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don't, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we'll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.

Thus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or '-' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.

If E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, '-' or x? But '-' if it's somewhere? Actually, '-' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.

And with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.

Moreover, K and S are common enough? So that's a good second guess.

Therefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).
- N is not in the secret word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).

For the second guess, I aim to:
1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.
2. Keep A in the second position.
3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).
4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.

The word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:
- T at position 1 (new letter to test).
- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).
- K at position 3 (new letter to test).
- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).
- S at position 5 (new letter to test).

This guess allows us to test E's position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.

<guess>TAKES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   Interpretation:
   - C, R, N: not in the word.
   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - E: in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   Interpretation:
   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.
   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? 
     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). 
     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?
     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.

Rethink: 
The first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.
But second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn't make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that's against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?

Check the words:
- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: 
Breaking down:
CRANE: 
C is position 1? 
R is position 2? 
But feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
Wait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: 
C (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? 

I think I miscounted positions? 

Typically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E

But the feedback for CRANE: 
C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) 
So A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? 
Similarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.

But then in TAKES: 
TAKES: 
T (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)

Feedback: 
T(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?
A(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? 
But wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?

No: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? 

Now, in TAKES, we put:
Position 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? 
Position 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? 
But we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? 
Similarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? 
E at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? 
S at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?

So from first guess: 
- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? 
- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? 

Second guess: 
- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? 
- A at position 2: '-' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that's correct? 
- K: x? So K is not in the word? 
- E at position 4: '-' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? 
- S at position 5: '-' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? 

Moreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: 
First guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? 

From second guess: 
If E at position 4 is '-' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? 

Also, S is present? But not at position 5? 
T is present? But not at position 1? 

Therefore, summary:

Confirmed:
- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)
- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S

Letters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)

Additionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? 

Also, S position: present but not position 5? 
T present but not position 1? 

We also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? 

But E must be at 1 or 2? 

So possibilities: 
Secret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? 
But if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? 
Position 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? 

If E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? 

If E at 2, then position 1: some letter? 

Available letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? 

So the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? 

We have two possibilities: 
Case 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? 
Case 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? 

Now, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got '-' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? 

Also, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? 

So position 1 must be some letter that we haven't tried yet? Or E? 

Similarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? 

Now, both T and S present? Let me list positions: 
1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? 
Option 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? 
Then position 2: must be a letter? We don't know? Could be T? or S? or another? 
But E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? 

But if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? 
But in TAKES: we put T at position1: got '-' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? 

Similarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? 

Also, we have E at position 2? But then position1? 

But wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? 

Therefore, letters:
- E must be at 1 or 2? 
- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? 
- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? 

Also, we know position3 is A? 

Now, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? 

But TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got '-' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? 

Therefore, possibilities:

Position1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got '-' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? 

Also, we don't know how many letters? But there are 5? 

So: 
Known: 
- Position 3 must be A? 
- E must be at position1 or2? 
- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? 
- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? 

But position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? 

And E must be at1 or2? 

If position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? 
Also position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? 
Similarly, T must be at2,4, or5? 

But position2: could be T or S? 

But wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? 

We need to form a word? 

Options ? 

Also, position4 and5? 

Secret word: 
Position1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? 

But E must be present? and at1 or2? 

So guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? 

But we also have T? 

Possible words? 

For example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don't know? 

Or we can try to include both S and T? 

Possible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? 

Try: ""EASTS""? Not valid? 

Or not: 

Common words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? 

""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got '-' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be '-'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? 

So ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? 

But E must be at1 or2? So E at2? 

So we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? 

But let me test E at1: 

Example: ""EASTS"" not? 

""ETAPE""? Not common? 

Another: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? 

Better: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? 

Common: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? 

How about: EASEL? Not? 

""PASTE""? But P is new? 

But let's think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? 

For example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? 

Or ""EASES""? But repeated? 

Better: ""ETALS""? Not word? 

Common word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? 

Therefore, we must have a word that has:
Position3: A?
Position1: E? 
Position2: ? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

And with T and S included? 

Or not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? 

But our guess must be valid? 

So if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _

But E and A? 

Available letters: must include T and S? 

Plus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? 

For example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? 

""ESTAT""? Not? 

""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? 

""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? 

""EAT AS"" not 5? 

Perhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: 
""ETATS""? Not common? 
""ETA S"" not? 

Another: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? 

Better to do E at position2? 

Assume E at position2? Then secret: 
Position1: something? 
Position2: E? 
Position3: A? 
Position4: ? 
Position5: ? 

Then we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? 
S must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? 

In TAKES: we put S at position5 and got '-' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? 

Similarly, T must be at4 or5? 

We have words: 
For example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? 
Or "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? 
SEATS is valid? But has S twice? 

"" SEATS "" : positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: A? 
4: T? 
5: S? 

But we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? 

But if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got '-' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be '-'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be 'x'? 

This is complicated? 

Instead, choose a word without repeated letters? 

For example: 
Option1: E in position1: 
Possible words: E ? A ? ?

And ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? 

But we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? 

Letters available: E,A,T,S? and others? 

So E _ A _ _

Must include T and S? And two positions? 

But only two missing letters? 

E (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) 

And T and S must be in there? 

Examples: 
""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? 
""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? 

Word where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). 
But does not include E at1? Only at2? 
But D E A T H: 
Position1: D? We hope E? 

With E at1: ""E'? 
Like ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? 
Or ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? 

Not easy? 

Alternative: E at position2? 

Secret: _ E A _ _

And must include T and S? 

So options: 
Position1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? 

If S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _

Then must contain T? at position4 or5? 

For example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? 

""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? 

Valid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? 

So we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked '- the S that is present but not at position5? 

But we don't care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? 

Then feedback? 

But perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? 

Another common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? 
Positions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? 

"" OASIS ""? O at1? 

"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? 

So hard? 

We know position3 is fixed as A? 

Therefore, guess? 

We cannot force E at1? Because few common words? 

Then try E at position2? 

Similarly? 

Or give up and use a word to test the other letters? 

But we also have K eliminated? 

So let me list all? 

Known:
- Present: A, E, T, S
- Absent: C, R, N, K

Unknown letters: many? 

Also, positions:
- Position3: A (fixed)
- E must be at1 or2? 
- T must be at2,4,5? 
- S must be at1,2,4? 

And not: T at1? S at5? 

Also, the secret and guess: 

Possible next guess: include both T and S and E? 

But E at position2? For example? 

Guess at word: let put E at position2? 

Then the word: ? E A ? ?

Also include T and S? 

For example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? 

But we cannot: because S must be somewhere? 

"" S E A T T "" not word? 

"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? 
But S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got '-'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? 

Then if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn't have S at5? So feedback: S will get 'x'? Or '-'? 
If secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get '-'? But and S at position1? 

H""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? 
We have position3: A? So part fits? 

Also, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? 

Moreover, S at5? We know S isn't at5? So it would get '-' in feedback? But also, T at4? 

This is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? 

Then we get feedback? 

But it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? 

Or we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? 

Or ""FEATS"": F E A T S? 

Or ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got '-' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? 

So ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? 

Therefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? 

Also, not having repeated? 

BEATS: 
- B new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3? 
- T at4? 
- S at5? 

We know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be '-'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? 

Similarly, the only new letter is B? 

To maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? 

Or we can make a guess that tests E at position1? 

How about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? 

Perhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? 

Our priority: determine E's position? Either at1 or2? 

So best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it's there? If not, must be at2? 

So let's try E at1? 

Word: E _ A _ _

Also include T and S? and avoid S at5? 

So E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? 

Guess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? 

""E S A T S"" not? 

""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? 

""E S A B T"" not? 

"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? 

Perhaps not? 

Use: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? 

""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? 

""E X A M P"" not? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? 

Must include? 

But perhaps we can make a guess that doesn't have both? But that would miss one? 

But we know S and T are present? So if we don't include, we get no info? 

So include both? 

 Therefore, back to E at position2? 

Then Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? 
- L at1: new? 
- E at2? 
- A at3?
- S at4? (testing? 
- T at5? 

But T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? 

And S at4? 

Also, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? 

Then this word? LEAST: 
1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? 

If E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? 

Similarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? 

We can choose a word with common letters? 

Or ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? 

So ""LEAST"" might be good? 

Then after guess: 

If E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? 

So guess: ""LEAST"" 

<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  
  Interpretation:  
  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  
  - K is not in the word.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - S is in the word but not in position 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  
- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  
- **Positional constraints:**  
  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  
  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  
  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  
- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  
- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  
- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  
- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  
  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  
  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  
  - L at position 1 (new letter).  
  - A at position 3 (fixed).

This guess efficiently narrows down E's position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.

<guess>LEAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Interpretation: 
     - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.
     - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   - Interpretation:
     - T is in the word but not in position 1.
     - A is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know A is at position 3).
     - K is not in the word.
     - E is in the word but not in position 4.
     - S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. Guess 3: LEAST -> Feedback: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation:
     - L is not in the word.
     - E is in the correct position (position 2? Let's check the word).
     - A is in the correct position (position 3).
     - S is in the correct position (position 4).
     - T is in the correct position (position 5).

Now, let's analyze the word LEAST:
- Positions: 
  - 1: L -> x (not in word)
  - 2: E -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 3: A -> ✓ (correct position, we already knew this)
  - 4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  - 5: T -> ✓ (correct position)

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: E (from E(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 3: A (known from CRANE and confirmed)
  - Position 4: S (from S(✓) in LEAST)
  - Position 5: T (from T(✓) in LEAST)

We also know position 1 must be filled because we have positions 2-5 determined.

Recall from previous feedback:
- E must be in the word, and we have it at position 2. (From LEAST feedback, E at 2 is correct, which matches the constraint that E was at 1 or 2? Now we know it is at 2.)
- From CRANE: E was at position 5 and got (-), so E is not at position 5, which is consistent (now E is at 2).
- From TAKES: T was at position 1? We put T at 1 in TAKES and got (-), meaning T is not at position 1? But now we see T at position 5? So yes, T is at position 5? 
- Similarly, in TAKES: S was at position 5 and got (-), meaning S is not at position 5? But now we have S at position 4? So it is consistent? 

So the secret word so far: ? E A S T

We know the first letter is missing, and we must guess it.

What do we know about the first letter?
- It cannot be: C, R, N, K, L (from the x feedback in previous guesses).
- We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K, S, L (from guesses).

The first letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and is in the word? But we don't know any other letters? Because the word is 5 letters? And we have four: E, A, S, T? And one missing.

From the feedback, we don't have any other letters? Because:
- The word is exactly ? E A S T? 
- And we know that the word contains E, A, S, T? And the first letter? 

But from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is in word? But we didn't have the position? Similarly, T and S were missing? 

But now with LEAST: we matched E, A, S, T? So the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been guessed? And it must complete a valid English word? 

Letters eliminated: C, R, N, K, L? 

We haven't guessed many vowels? Or other consonants? 

What are possible words that end with ""EAST""? 

Common ones: 
- BEAST
- FEAST? But FEAST is F E A S T? 
- YEART? Not? 
- HEART? But R is eliminated? 
- Only words like BEAST, FEAST? 

BEAST: B E A S T? 
FEAST: F E A S T? 
PEAST? Not common? 

Also, from the elimination: 
- R is not? So no HEART? 

What about WORLD? Not. 

So possible first letters: 
B, F, etc? 

But we haven't tested B or F? 

We can just guess one of them? 

But note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 4? So we can try? 

But let me list all possibilities? 

Possible words:
- BEAST: B E A S T
- FEAST: F E A S T
- HEAST? Not common? 
- GEAST? No
- VEAST? No
- PEAST? Not common?
- etc. 

Common ones are BEAST and FEAST? 

We can guess BEAST? If it is not? Then next? 

But how to decide? 

We have no feedback on B or F? 

Also note: from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is present? That was satisfied. 

Similarly, we have T and S? 

We can also consider if there are other possibilities? 

For example, words like ""LEAST"" itself? But we guessed LEAST and got L(x)? So L is not? Therefore, LEAST cannot be the word? 

We are missing the first letter? So ""LEAST"" was our guess? And we got E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) but L(x)? So the word is not LEAST? 

Similarly, it must be ?EAST? 

So guess BEAST? 

If we guess BEAST: 
- If correct, we win? 
- If not, then likely FEAST? 

But to be sure? We can guess BEAST? 

But also, perhaps there is other? Or we might lose a try? But two options? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

Is there any word like MEAST? Not common? 

So probably BEAST or FEAST? 

We can guess one of them? 

Let's guess BEAST? 

Because B is common? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But wait: in our previous guess LEAST, we have E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) and L(x)? 

So for BEAST: 
- Position1: B? 
- Position2: E? (we know E is at2? So it should be ✓? 
- Position3: A? ✓ 
- Position4: S? ✓ 
- Position5: T? ✓ 

Then the feedback will tell? 

If it is BEAST, all ✓? 

If not, then we get B(x) and then we know it's FEAST? 

We have two tries left? So safe? 

Therefore, guess BEAST? 

But is BEAST a valid word? Yes? 

So next guess: BEAST? 

But note: we don't know if B is present? But it could be? 

So yes? 

We can do that? 

Alternatively, is there any elimination? 

From TAKES: we had A at position2? Got A(-)? But that was because A is at position3? Not because the first letter? 

So no additional info? 

Therefore, guess ""BEAST"" 

<guess>BEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**  
  Revealed:  
  - Position 3 must be **A** (✓).  
  - **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  
  - C, R, N are not in the word (x).  

- **Guess 2 (TAKES)**  
  Revealed:  
  - **T** is in the word but not at position 1 (-).  
  - **A** is in the word but not at position 2 (-) (redundant with Guess 1).  
  - K is not in the word (x).  
  - **E** is not at position 4 (-).  
  - **S** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  

- **Guess 3 (LEAST)**  
  Revealed:  
  - L is not in the word (x).  
  - **E** is at position 2 (✓).  
  - **A** is at position 3 (✓).  
  - **S** is at position 4 (✓).  
  - **T** is at position 5 (✓).  

### Current Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: `{Position 1} E A S T`.  
- Position 1 cannot be **C, R, N, K, L** (eliminated letters).  
- The only common English words are **BEAST** or **FEAST**.  
- Both are valid 5-letter words.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **BEAST** to confirm position 1.
- If incorrect, **FEAST** remains the only logical option (saved for Guess 5 if needed).

<guess>BEAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
Guess 4: BEAST -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for four guesses:

1. Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)
   - Interpretation: A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). E is in the word but not in position 5. C, R, and N are not in the word.

2. Guess 2: TAKES -> Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)
   - Interpretation: T is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the word but not in position 2 (which we already know). K is not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 4. S is in the word but not in position 5.

3. Guess 3: LEAST -> Feedback: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation: L is not in the word. E is in the correct position (position 2). A is in the correct position (position 3). S is in the correct position (position 4). T is in the correct position (position 5). So the word has the form: [unknown] E A S T

4. Guess 4: BEAST -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
   - Interpretation: B is not in the word. E, A, S, and T are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5). So the secret word is _ E A S T.

From the feedback, the secret word is a 5-letter word ending with ""EAST"". The first letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, K, L, B.

We know the word must end with ""EAST"". Common English words that fit this pattern:
- BEAST (already guessed, and B is eliminated)
- FEAST (F E A S T)
- Other less common words: GEAST? (uncommon), HEAST? (not a word), etc.

Given that BEAST was incorrect (B is not in the word and not the first letter), the only remaining common word is FEAST.

Therefore, we can confidently guess FEAST.

<guess>FEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)** confirmed:
   - Position 3 is **A** (✓).
   - **E** is in the word, but not at position 5 (-).
   - C, R, N are absent (x).

2. **Guess 2 (TAKES)** confirmed:
   - **T** is present but not at position 1 (-).
   - **S** is present but not at position 5 (-).
   - E is not at position 4 (-) (consistent with E at position 2).
   - K is absent (x).
   - A is present but not at position 2 (-) (redundant with Guess 1).

3. **Guess 3 (LEAST)** revealed:
   - Position 2 is **E** (✓), position 3 is **A** (✓), position 4 is **S** (✓), position 5 is **T** (✓).
   - L is absent (x).
   - Secret word structure: `[?] E A S T`.

4. **Guess 4 (BEAST)** confirmed:
   - Position 2 is E (✓), position 3 is A (✓), position 4 is S (✓), position 5 is T (✓).
   - B is absent (x).

### Deductions:
- The secret word must be in the form `[?]EAST`.
- Eliminated letters for position 1: **C, R, N, K, L, B** (from all ""x"" feedback).
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **FEAST**.

### Guess 5:
- **FEAST** is the only viable option. It matches all constraints:
  - Position 1: F (untested letter, not eliminated).
  - Positions 2–5: E, A, S, T (confirmed correct).

If correct, this solves the puzzle.

The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a second guess that:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word.\n- Must include the letter E (because E is in the word) but not in the fifth position.\n- Must have A in the second position.\n- Must not include C, R, or N.\n\nWe can also try to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to form a word with A in the second position and containing E.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- We have A in the second position: so pattern is _ A _ _ _\n\nAnd we must include E somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, E can be in positions 1,3, or 4? Not necessarily: the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. It could appear in other positions.\n\nBut note: not in the fifth position because it got a \'-\' which means it exists but is not at the end. So E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nHowever, we must also avoid C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words with A in the second position and E somewhere else.\n\nExamples:\n- ""SAUTE"": S (1), A (2, fixed), U (3), T (4), E (5). But E is in the fifth position? And we know E should not be at the fifth position? Wait, feedback on E was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the fifth position. So in our next guess, if we put E in the fifth, it won\'t be correct. But we don\'t know if that position is E or not. However, we know that in the secret word, E is not the fifth. Therefore, in our guess, we can put E in other positions to test.\n\nBut note: the secret word has E somewhere except at the end? Actually, the fifth position is the end? So E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4? But position 2 is A, so E cannot be in position 2. Therefore, E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nTherefore, for our next guess we can try to put E in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s try to find words that have:\n- First, third, or fourth letter E and second letter A.\n\nAlso avoiding C, R, N.\n\nCommon words:\n- E at position 1: E.g., ""EARLY"" -> E A R L Y -> but R is not allowed? R is not present, so we cannot use R. Also, R was already eliminated.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N.\n\nSo ""EARLY"" is not good because of R.\n\n""EATEN"": E A T E N -> but we have N? N is eliminated. Also, E at the end? No, ""EATEN"" has E at positions 1 and 4? But the fifth is N which is invalid.\n\nWe need a word without C, R, N and with A at position 2 and E at either 1, 3, or 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLATE"" -> P L A T E -> but second letter is L? That\'s not A. Must fix: second letter must be A.\n\nPattern: _ A _ _ _\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: can be any letter except C,R,N and must be present? Not necessarily; we can try new letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""HASTE"": H A S T E -> E is in fifth? That\'s position 5? But we know E isn\'t position 5? We can try, but E might be elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to avoid E at five? We know the secret doesn\'t have E at five? So we can use E in other guesses? But if we put E at five, it will show \'-\' again? But we already know E is in the word? So unless we test a different position.\n\nActually, we want to test E in new positions: 1,3,4.\n\nBut we can also try words that don\'t put E at five? Because if we put E at five, it will always be \'-\' so not optimal for getting new information? We can avoid it to test other positions.\n\nLet\'s avoid E at five? Because we already know E should be elsewhere? So putting E at five doesn\'t give new info? Actually, we have to consider we don\'t know: the feedback tells us about our guess relative to secret? So if we put E at five and it shows -, we know it\'s still present? But \'-\' means it\'s present but not at that position. But we already know E is present? So that won\'t add anything? Not necessarily: it confirms again that E is present? But we know that.\n\nBut we already know E is present? So if we put it at five, we waste a position? We can better utilize by putting E in a different position? So we get ✓ or -? If ✓, then E is at that position; if -, then E is elsewhere? So yes, priority should be to put E in positions 1,3, or 4.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters? Because we only know A and E? And we know C,R,N are not? And we have tried some positions.\n\nList tried letters: in CRANE, we used C,R,A,N,E. We know A and E are in the word, and C,R,N are not? So remaining letters.\n\nWe can try words that include other common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nWord suggestion: How about ""PLANE""? But N is not allowed? Also, R not? ""PLANE"" has N? So no.\n\n""SAUCE"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n""LATTE"" -> T repeated? But okay? However: pattern: _ A _ _ _. If we do ""L A T T E"": L (1), A (2), T (3), T (4), E (5). But E is at 5? Avoid? And we have T twice? We don\'t know if double letters are allowed? The game may have repeated letters? But rule: feedback per letter? Not specified if word can have repeated? Typically Wordle allows repeated? But in this case, we don\'t know? And T is a common letter? But also, E at 5? We already know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid E at 5? Then this word has E at 5? Not good.\n\n""SAUTE"": S A U T E -> E at 5? So avoid? Similarly, ""LANCE"" -> N is forbidden? Not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s find words that have E in positions 1,3, or 4 and second letter A.\n\nFor example, E at position 1: words like ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> second letter A? E at 1 and at last? But E is present? But we don\'t mind having E twice? However, the secret word might have E once? But we don\'t know? So we can test? But E is at 1 and 5? E at position 1: we don\'t know? E at 5: we suspect it shouldn\'t be? We got E at 5 as \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So having E at 5 is okay? But if we put E at 5, we know it won\'t be ✓? But as of now, we must incorporate E? Let me see: EAGLE: E(1) A(2) G(3) L(4) E(5). We know E is not in the word at five? So we\'ll get E at 1: either ✓ or -, and E at 5: \'-\'? But E at 5 might be present elsewhere? But we know E is in the word? So E at 5 will still show \'-\'? Because it is in the word but not at five? Actually, in CRANE we guessed E at position 5 and got \'-\' meaning E is not at position 5? So the secret word has E somewhere else. Therefore, in EAGLE: if E is at position 1,3 or 4? We\'ll get more info.\n\nBut EAGLE has E at 1 and at 5? We also have A at 2? But issue: letters used: E, A, G, L, ? E? G and L are new? Also, avoid C,R,N? G and L are okay? This word is ""EAGLE"".\n\nBut ""EAGLE"" has E at both positions? And we think E might be only once? But the secret word might have E at one position? Even if it has two E? The feedback will tell per letter? So if we guess EAGLE and secret has one E? Then one E will show ✓ or - and the other E might show ✓ if both are in? Actually, standard Wordle: if there is one E and we put two E, only one E will be at correct position? The other might be ✓? No: let me clarify rules.\n\nTypically: Each occurrence of the letter counts? So if secret has one E and we have two E, then one of the E\'s might be marked correctly? And the other one might be \'x\'? Because the position matters? Alternatively, it might show both as present? But in Wordle, the feedback marks each letter individually? We mark each letter? So if secret has one E and we have two E\'s? Then only one E will be marked as ✓ or -, and the other as x? Because there is no duplicate? In this case? Yes.\n\nTherefore, it is inefficient to have repeated letters? Especially when we don\'t know? So avoiding repeated? Especially E? We have other letters.\n\nAnother word? For example, ""BAKED"": B A K E D -> has E at position 4? Second letter A? Avoid C,R,N? Good? Then E at 4? So we test E at position 4? Also, B, K, D are new letters.\n\nBut is that a word? BAKED? Yes, baked. Letters: B,A,K,E,D? Not repeated? And E at 4? So we can do that.\n\nOther words? ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4? Also E at 4? T,A,K,E,S? Good.\n\nBut we want more common letters? For instance, S or T are common.\n\nCan we use S and T? For example, ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> A at 2, E at 5? But E at 5: we already know E isn\'t at 5? So we should avoid E at 5? Then if we put E at 5 again, we get \'-\' for E at 5? Which we already know? So not helping? We want new positions? So PAST E? Avoid.\n\nBetter to have E at position 1,3, or 4? To get new feedback.\n\nSo let\'s prioritize words with E in a new position? Position 1: e.g, ""EARTH"" -> E A R T H -> R is not allowed? Forbidden.\n\n""EACH S"" -> EACH is 4? Not 5? How about ""EATER""? E A T E R -> but R is forbidden? Also E repeated? Not good.\n\n""SAVED"": S A V E D -> E at position 4? Good? Second letter A? E at 4? Avoid C,R,N? S,V,E,D? V is not very common? But okay.\n\nHow about ""TABLE"": T A B L E -> E at 5? Avoid.\n\nWith E at position 1: ""EARTH"" - rejected? ""EAGLE"" - E at 1 and 5? Issue? Or ""EASEL""? E A S E L? E repeated? Not recommended.\n\nWith E at position 3: for example, ""MATEY"": M A T E Y? Or ""LATER"": L A T E R -> R forbidden? Not good.\n\n""GAMES"": G A M E S -> E at 4? So E not at 5? But M and G? Okay? But S at the end? New letter.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"" as above? Or ""TAKES"": T A K E S -> E at 4.\n\n""TAKES"" seems good: T,A,K,E,S? All common letters? Also, T at 1, K at 3, S at 5? All new? And E at 4? So we can test?\n\nIt\'s a five letters word? ""TAKES""? Yes.\n\nIt fits: pattern _ A _ _ _ is T A K E S? Second letter A? Yes? E at position 4? Avoids C,R,N? Yes? So we can use ""TAKES"".\n\nBut perhaps we can use a word that has E at position 1? To see if it\'s first? But ""TAKES"" doesn\'t have E at 1? We have position 1=T, which might also be a common letter? So okay? Alternatively, ""PLACE"": P L A C E? But C is forbidden? Not allowed? C was used in first guess and eliminated? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S L A T E? E is at 5? Avoid? We must avoid E at 5? So no.\n\nTherefore, ""TAKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother word? ""DAILY"": D A I L Y? But E is missing? We must include E? Because E is in the word? So we must include E? Otherwise, if we don\'t, and E is not guessed? We get no info? And if later E positions? But we know E is present? So better include E? Also, rule is we have to guess valid word? And ""DAILY"" has no E? Then for E, we\'ll get no new info? But we already know E is in? But we need to find its position? So we should include E? Yes.\n\nThus, ""TAKES"" includes E at a new position (4)? Which we hope to get feedback: either ✓ for E? meaning E is indeed at 4? or \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? Specifically, not at 4? Then we know E must be at 1 or 3? Since 2 is A? Position 5 is eliminated? So only possibilities: 1,3,4.\n\nIf E at 4 turns ✓, great? If not, \'-\' or x? But \'-\' if it\'s somewhere? Actually, \'-\' would mean E is in the word but not position 4? Then we know for sure E is at 1 or 3? Similarly, if ✓? Then we know position 4 is E? Then we have A at 2? So pattern for secret: ?A?E? Now? But if not, we know E not at 4? So we have to try E at 1 or 3 next.\n\nAnd with ""TAKES"", we also test T at 1, K at 3, and S at 5? So we get new letters.\n\nMoreover, K and S are common enough? So that\'s a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ""TAKES""After evaluating the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is not in the secret word (x).\n- R is not in the secret word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, ✓).\n- N is not in the secret word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in the fifth position (-), meaning it must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is A and position 5 is eliminated).\n\nFor the second guess, I aim to:\n1. Include E in one of the positions it could be (1, 3, or 4) to gather positional information.\n2. Keep A in the second position.\n3. Avoid the letters C, R, and N (as they are not in the secret word).\n4. Introduce new common letters like T, S, K, etc., to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""TAKES"" fits these criteria:\n- T at position 1 (new letter to test).\n- A at position 2 (confirmed correct position, kept).\n- K at position 3 (new letter to test).\n- E at position 4 (testing E in a previously untried position).\n- S at position 5 (new letter to test).\n\nThis guess allows us to test E\'s position and potentially confirm other letters or eliminate them based on feedback.\n\n<guess>TAKES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - C, R, N: not in the word.\n   - A: in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n   - E: in the word but not in position 5.\n\n2. Guess 2: TAKES -> T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\n   Interpretation:\n   - T: not at position 1, but present in the word.\n   - A: not at position 2? Wait, this contradicts previous feedback? \n     But note: in the first guess, A was at position 2 and got ✓ (correct position). \n     In the second guess, A is at position 2 again? Why is it marked as (-) meaning wrong position?\n     This indicates that in the secret word, A is not actually at position 2? But wait, the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2.\n\nRethink: \nThe first feedback: CRANE -> A was at position 2 and got ✓, meaning the secret word has A at position 2.\nBut second guess: TAKES has A at position 2 and now we get A(-)? This doesn\'t make sense because the same position was correct before? Unless the wordle rules allow changing the secret? But that\'s against the game? So there must be a misunderstanding.\n\nWait: the feedback per guess is independent? But the secret word is fixed? So how can A be at the same position? We got ✓ in first guess? Then in second guess at same position? It should be ✓ again? Unless I made a mistake?\n\nCheck the words:\n- CRANE: positions: 1:C, 2:R? No: CRANE -> C(1), R(2)? Wait no: \nBreaking down:\nCRANE: \nC is position 1? \nR is position 2? \nBut feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nWait, A is the third letter? So CRANE: \nC (position 1), R (position 2), A (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5)? \n\nI think I miscounted positions? \n\nTypically, positions are indexed starting from 1? So:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: E\n\nBut the feedback for CRANE: \nC(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-) \nSo A is position 3? ✓ means position 3 is A? \nSimilarly, E is at position 5? But E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? So secret word has E somewhere else.\n\nBut then in TAKES: \nTAKES: \nT (1), A (2), K (3), E (4), S (5)\n\nFeedback: \nT(-) : T is in the word but not at position 1?\nA(-) : A is in the word but not at position 2? \nBut wait: A was already known to be at position 3 from first guess? So why put A at position 2 in TAKES? That was a mistake?\n\nNo: in first guess A was at position 3? So we thought position 3 is A? \n\nNow, in TAKES, we put:\nPosition 1: T -> (-) meaning T is present but not in position 1? \nPosition 2: A -> (-) meaning A is present but not in position 2? \nBut we know from first feedback that A must be at position 3? Then why at position 2? We tried to test? But we moved A to position 2? And got a (-): which is consistent? Because A should be at position 3? \nSimilarly, position 3: K -> (x) not in the word? \nE at position 4: (-) meaning E is present but not at position 4? \nS at position 5: (-) meaning S is present but not at position 5?\n\nSo from first guess: \n- C, R, N are not in the word? Also, R was position 2? And K is also not? \n- A at position 3 is ✓? And E is present but not at position 5? \n\nSecond guess: \n- T is present (at position 1? We put T at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is in the word but not at position 1? \n- A at position 2: \'-\' meaning A is in the word? But not at position 2? We know A is at position 3? So that\'s correct? \n- K: x? So K is not in the word? \n- E at position 4: \'-\' meaning E is in the word? But not at position 4? \n- S at position 5: \'-\' meaning S is in the word? But not at position 5? \n\nMoreover, we know E is not at position 5 (from first)? And now also not at position 4? Then where? E could be at position 1? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? But position 3 is A? So E cannot be at position 3? Also, we have: \nFirst guess E was at position 5? Then E must be at 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? But position 3 is A? So E must be at 1,2, or 4? However second guess: E at position 4? We got (-) meaning E is present? But not at position 4? Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2? But position 2? We have A at position 2? Wait: in the secret, position 2 is not A? Because we know A is at position 3? So position 2 still? \n\nFrom second guess: \nIf E at position 4 is \'-\' then E is not at 4? Earlier from first guess E is not at 5? And position 3 is A? So E must be at position 1 or 2? \n\nAlso, S is present? But not at position 5? \nT is present? But not at position 1? \n\nTherefore, summary:\n\nConfirmed:\n- Position 3: A (from first guess ✓)\n- Letters in the word: A (pos3), E, T, S\n\nLetters not in the word: C, R, N, K (and also from CRANE: R was already out, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, E is at either position 1 or 2? Because position 4 and 5 are eliminated? And position 3 is taken by A? \n\nAlso, S position: present but not position 5? \nT present but not position 1? \n\nWe also know: S cannot be at position 5? And T cannot be at position 1? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nSo possibilities: \nSecret word: position 1: could be E? or T? or S? or other? But E is one? \nBut if E at 1? Then position 1: E? Then positions: E ? ? A ? \nPosition 2: could be T or S? Or other? But E must be at 1 or 2? \n\nIf E at 1, then position 2: not A (because A at3)? And position 2 has some letter? \n\nIf E at 2, then position 1: some letter? \n\nAvailable letters: we know T and S are in? But not at position 1? S not position 5? T not position 1? \n\nSo the secret word must contain T and S? But T cannot be at position 1? And S cannot at 5? Similarly E at either 1 or 2? \n\nWe have two possibilities: \nCase 1: Position 1 is E? Then since E is at 1, then T and S must be elsewhere? \nCase 2: Position 2 is E? Then T and S elsewhere? \n\nNow, what about position 1? We put T in second guess at position 1? Got \'-\' meaning T is present but not at 1? So position 1 cannot be T? Similarly, S cannot be at position 5? \n\nAlso, from CRANE: at position 1: C got x? So position 1 is not C? and not T? \n\nSo position 1 must be some letter that we haven\'t tried yet? Or E? \n\nSimilarly position 5? S cannot be? So position 5 must be something else? \n\nNow, both T and S present? Let me list positions: \n1: cannot be T (feedback TAKES: T at1->-), cannot be C? So must be E? or another letter? \nOption 1: E at position 1? Then position 1 is E? \nThen position 2: must be a letter? We don\'t know? Could be T? or S? or another? \nBut E is at position 1? Then position 3 is A? Position4: ? Position5: ? \n\nBut if E at position 1? Then T must be placed elsewhere? But T can be placed at position 2,4, or5? \nBut in TAKES: we put T at position1: got \'-\' meaning T is present? But not at1? So if E at1? Then T must be at another position? Similarly, S must be somewhere? \n\nSimilarly, if E at position 2? Then position1 cannot be T? Must be something else? \n\nAlso, we have E at position 2? But then position1? \n\nBut wait: we put A at position2 in TAKES? Got A(-) meaning A present but not at2? So position2 is not A? But we know position3 is A? So position2 is vacant? \n\nTherefore, letters:\n- E must be at 1 or 2? \n- T present -> T must be at2,4, or5? Because not1? \n- S present -> S must be at1,2,3,4? But not5? and not3 because 3 is A? So S at1,2,4? \n\nAlso, we know position3 is A? \n\nNow, if E at position1? Then position2: cannot be E? Then position2 could be T or S? Or other? \n\nBut TAKES: we also has E at position4? Got \'-\' meaning E not at4? So E cannot at4? \n\nTherefore, possibilities:\n\nPosition1: either E or T? But T not allowed? Only E? Because T at1 got \'-\' so T cannot be? So position1 must be E? Or another letter? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know how many letters? But there are 5? \n\nSo: \nKnown: \n- Position 3 must be A? \n- E must be at position1 or2? \n- T is present -> positions:2,4,5? \n- S is present -> positions:1,2,4? \n\nBut position1: cannot be T? So position1: either E or S? Or something else? But E possibility? \n\nAnd E must be at1 or2? \n\nIf position1 is E? Then E is at1? Then we have solved E? \nAlso position1 is E? Then S? S must be at2 or4? Because cannot at5? \nSimilarly, T must be at2,4, or5? \n\nBut position2: could be T or S? \n\nBut wait: we have the letter from CRANE: we used C,R,A,N,E? But R got x? So we skipped? \n\nWe need to form a word? \n\nOptions ? \n\nAlso, position4 and5? \n\nSecret word: \nPosition1: E? or if not E, then possibly S? \n\nBut E must be present? and at1 or2? \n\nSo guess3: we can try E at position1? And S at another position? \n\nBut we also have T? \n\nPossible words? \n\nFor example, if we guess E position1 and T position2? But E at1, so first letter E? Then second letter? But we don\'t know? \n\nOr we can try to include both S and T? \n\nPossible words: ESTATE? Too long? Also, S repeated? Not efficient? \n\nTry: ""EASTS""? Not valid? \n\nOr not: \n\nCommon words: like ""TEAMS""? But T at1? We cannot? Position1 cannot be T? \n\n""SEATS""? S E A T S? But has S twice? Also positions: S at1, E at2? Then A at3? Then T at4? S at5? But we know S cannot be at position5? Because in second guess: S at5? got \'-\' meaning not at5? Then ""SEATS"" S at5? But then S at5? So it would be \'-\'? Also, we tried S at5? We know S present? Probably once? \n\nSo ""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? But we know S not at5? So S at1? Then T at4? and position3:A? But E at2? \n\nBut E must be at1 or2? So E at2? \n\nSo we can guess a word with E at position2? Or E at1? \n\nBut let me test E at1: \n\nExample: ""EASTS"" not? \n\n""ETAPE""? Not common? \n\nAnother: ""ELATE"": E L A T E? But E repeated? Positions: E at1, L at2? But E is also at5? But we know E not at5? So position5 is E? Not allowed? \n\nBetter: ""EAGLE""? But G? and E at1 and5? Not? \n\nCommon: ""ALONE""? But we know A position3? Not at1? \n\nHow about: EASEL? Not? \n\n""PASTE""? But P is new? \n\nBut let\'s think: we need a word that has E at position1? and A at3? Then something? \n\nFor example, ""EDGES""? But D,G? Not common? \n\nOr ""EASES""? But repeated? \n\nBetter: ""ETALS""? Not word? \n\nCommon word: ""EASEL"": E A S E L? E at1 and4? But position3: S? But we know position3 is A? So it must be E A (position1,2) then A at3? EASEL is E(1), A(2), S(3), E(4), L(5)? But we need position3: A? So in EASEL, position3 is S? But we know position3 must be A? So we cannot? \n\nTherefore, we must have a word that has:\nPosition3: A?\nPosition1: E? \nPosition2: ? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nAnd with T and S included? \n\nOr not necessarily? But we know T and S are in? \n\nBut our guess must be valid? \n\nSo if E at position1? Then we have ? words: E _ A _ _\n\nBut E and A? \n\nAvailable letters: must include T and S? \n\nPlus two other positions: position2 and position5? (position4? \n\nFor example: ""E S A T S"" ? Not? \n\n""ESTAT""? Not? \n\n""EXAMS""? But contains X? and M? \n\n""ELAND""? But N is forbidden? \n\n""EAT AS"" not 5? \n\nPerhaps E at position1? Then T at position2? Then A at3? Then ...? Words: \n""ETATS""? Not common? \n""ETA S"" not? \n\nAnother: ""TEALS""? But position1: T? But T at1? Cannot? \n\nBetter to do E at position2? \n\nAssume E at position2? Then secret: \nPosition1: something? \nPosition2: E? \nPosition3: A? \nPosition4: ? \nPosition5: ? \n\nThen we know T cannot at position1? So T must be at4 or5? \nS must be at position4 or1? (because not at5? Wait? Or not? Position1? Position4? \n\nIn TAKES: we put S at position5 and got \'-\' meaning S present but not5? So S can be at1,2,3,4? But not5? But position2? If E is there? So S cannot at2? Then S must be at1 or4? \n\nSimilarly, T must be at4 or5? \n\nWe have words: \nFor example, "" S E A T S "" but repeated? \nOr "" S E A T ?"" like ""SEATS"" -> but S E A T S? Not valid? \nSEATS is valid? But has S twice? \n\n"" SEATS "" : positions: \n1: S? \n2: E? \n3: A? \n4: T? \n5: S? \n\nBut we know S cannot be at position5? So SEATS has S at5? Therefore, it would be invalid? Not? But SEATS word? \n\nBut if we guess SEATS: then at position5: S? But according to previous feedback? S cannot be at5? Because in TAKES: S at5 got \'-\' meaning that S is in the word but not at position5? So secret word cannot have S at5? Then SEATS? If we guess? It has S at position5? Then the feedback for S at5? Should be \'-\'? Meaning S is present but not at5? But also S at1? If the secret has only one S? Then possibly both S? Or if secret has S at1? Then S at5? might be \'x\'? \n\nThis is complicated? \n\nInstead, choose a word without repeated letters? \n\nFor example: \nOption1: E in position1: \nPossible words: E ? A ? ?\n\nAnd ? must be filled with letters? Must include T and S? \n\nBut we have to avoid previous letters? C,R,N,K? \n\nLetters available: E,A,T,S? and others? \n\nSo E _ A _ _\n\nMust include T and S? And two positions? \n\nBut only two missing letters? \n\nE (1), ? (2), A(3), ?(4), ?(5) \n\nAnd T and S must be in there? \n\nExamples: \n""ELATE"" -> E L A T E -> but E repeated? \n""EATER"" -> E A T E R -> but A at3? Not? E A T E R: positions: E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)? But we need A at position3? So position2 is A in EATER? But we know position3 must be A? So not? \n\nWord where A is at3: e.g., ""DEATH""? D E A T H? Positions: D(1), E(2), A(3), T(4), H(5). \nBut does not include E at1? Only at2? \nBut D E A T H: \nPosition1: D? We hope E? \n\nWith E at1: ""E\'? \nLike ""EXALT"": E X A L T? Contains X,L,T? \nOr ""EPACT""? P,A,C,T? But C forbidden? \n\nNot easy? \n\nAlternative: E at position2? \n\nSecret: _ E A _ _\n\nAnd must include T and S? \n\nSo options: \nPosition1: must be T? or S? But T cannot be at position1? So position1 cannot be T? Must be S or another? \n\nIf S at position1: then secret: S E A _ _\n\nThen must contain T? at position4 or5? \n\nFor example: ""SEATS"" S at1 and5? Not good? \n\n""SEATS"" has S at1 and5? If secret has only one S? Then S at5 might be marked x? But if T at4: ""SEATS"" -> S E A T S? T at position4? \n\nValid word? But we know S at5 is not allowed? In secret, S cannot be at5? \n\nSo we can guess a word like ""SEATS? But S at5 will be marked \'- the S that is present but not at position5? \n\nBut we don\'t care? But also, it has S at1? Which might be accepted? \n\nThen feedback? \n\nBut perhaps we can guess ""SETAE? Too rare? \n\nAnother common word: ""STEAM"" -> S T E A M? \nPositions: S(1), T(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)? But we need A at position3? So not? \n\n"" OASIS ""? O at1? \n\n"" IDEAS ""? I at1, E at2? A at position4? Not3? \n\nSo hard? \n\nWe know position3 is fixed as A? \n\nTherefore, guess? \n\nWe cannot force E at1? Because few common words? \n\nThen try E at position2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nOr give up and use a word to test the other letters? \n\nBut we also have K eliminated? \n\nSo let me list all? \n\nKnown:\n- Present: A, E, T, S\n- Absent: C, R, N, K\n\nUnknown letters: many? \n\nAlso, positions:\n- Position3: A (fixed)\n- E must be at1 or2? \n- T must be at2,4,5? \n- S must be at1,2,4? \n\nAnd not: T at1? S at5? \n\nAlso, the secret and guess: \n\nPossible next guess: include both T and S and E? \n\nBut E at position2? For example? \n\nGuess at word: let put E at position2? \n\nThen the word: ? E A ? ?\n\nAlso include T and S? \n\nFor example, "" S E A T ?"" and position5: must not be S? So it could be T? \n\nBut we cannot: because S must be somewhere? \n\n"" S E A T T "" not word? \n\n"" B E A T S "" -> B at1, E at2, A at3! Yes, T at4, S at5? \nBut S is at position5? In the secret word, position5 cannot be S? Because S at5 got \'-\'? Meaning S is not at5? So ""BEATS"" has S at5? Which will be forbdden? \n\nThen if we guess ""BEATS"", at position5: S? But secret doesn\'t have S at5? So feedback: S will get \'x\'? Or \'-\'? \nIf secret has S not at5, then S at5 in guess will get \'-\'? But and S at position1? \n\nH""BEATS"": B E A T S? It has B at1? E at2? A at3? T at4? S at5? \nWe have position3: A? So part fits? \n\nAlso, E at position2? If we put E at2? Then it could be? \n\nMoreover, S at5? We know S isn\'t at5? So it would get \'-\' in feedback? But also, T at4? \n\nThis is acceptable? Guess ""BEATS"" as a valid word? \n\nThen we get feedback? \n\nBut it includes the known letter at3? And B is new? \n\nOr we can guess ""MEATS"": M E A T S? Similarly? \n\nOr ""FEATS"": F E A T S? \n\nOr ""TEAMS"": T E A M S? But T at1? T at1 we know we got \'-\' in TAKES? But T is present? Not at1? \n\nSo ""TEAMS"" not? Because T at position1 is not allowed? \n\nTherefore, words like ""BEATS"", ""FEATS"", etc? \n\nAlso, not having repeated? \n\nBEATS: \n- B new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3? \n- T at4? \n- S at5? \n\nWe know S is present? But not at5? So position5: S? and we know not! But feedback for position5: S will be \'-\'? Meaning that it is present but not at5? Which we already know? So not new? \n\nSimilarly, the only new letter is B? \n\nTo maximize information? Better to avoid S at5 and E at position we already know? \n\nOr we can make a guess that tests E at position1? \n\nHow about ""ESTAB"". Not 5? \n\nPerhaps use: ""TAPES"" -> but T at1? Cannot? \n\nOur priority: determine E\'s position? Either at1 or2? \n\nSo best: guess a word that has E at position1? then we know if it\'s there? If not, must be at2? \n\nSo let\'s try E at1? \n\nWord: E _ A _ _\n\nAlso include T and S? and avoid S at5? \n\nSo E at1, A at3? and then say T at4? and S at2? \n\nGuess: ""E S A T ?"" position5: must not be S? So it could be other? E.g., ""E S A T E"" -> but E repeated? And position5 E? not allowed? \n\n""E S A T S"" not? \n\n""E S A T H"" -> ""ETHAS"" not common? \n\n""E S A B T"" not? \n\n"" EASTS"" is a word? But S repeated? And not common? \n\nPerhaps not? \n\nUse: ""EATEN"" -> but we have N forbidden? \n\n""ELATE"" forbidden because of E at5? \n\n""E X A M P"" not? \n\nHard? \n\nAnother possibility: omit S or T? But we know they are present? \n\nMust include? \n\nBut perhaps we can make a guess that doesn\'t have both? But that would miss one? \n\nBut we know S and T are present? So if we don\'t include, we get no info? \n\nSo include both? \n\n Therefore, back to E at position2? \n\nThen Guess: for example, "" L E A S T "" -> L E A S T? \n- L at1: new? \n- E at2? \n- A at3?\n- S at4? (testing? \n- T at5? \n\nBut T at5? T can be at5? Because T can be at2,4, or5? \n\nAnd S at4? \n\nAlso, S not at5? So S at4 could be valid? \n\nThen this word? LEAST: \n1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T? \n\nIf E is indeed at2? Then great? Else if not, E at1? \n\nSimilarly, we use new letters? L and? Only one new? \n\nWe can choose a word with common letters? \n\nOr ""PEATS""? P E A T S? But T at4 and S at5? S at5 not allowed? \n\nSo ""LEAST"" might be good? \n\nThen after guess: \n\nIf E is at2? Then E at2 we assume? \n\nSo guess: ""LEAST"" \n\n<guess>LEAST</guess>Based on the feedback from two guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)**  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is in the word and in position 3 (correct).  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  \n  - C, R, N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: TAKES → Feedback: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)**  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - T is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already confirmed at position 3).  \n  - K is not in the word.  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - S is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Letters in the word:** A (position 3), E, T, S.  \n- **Letters not in the word:** C, R, N, K.  \n- **Positional constraints:**  \n  - E must be at position 1 or 2 (positions 4 and 5 are eliminated, position 3 is A).  \n  - T cannot be at position 1 (must be at 2, 4, or 5).  \n  - S cannot be at position 5 (must be at 1, 2, or 4).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize confirming the position of E (position 1 or 2) while testing T and S in viable positions.  \n- Use a word that positions E at position 2 to test that location (if E is not here, it must be at position 1).  \n- Avoid eliminated letters (C, R, N, K) and incorporate T and S.  \n- Introduce common new letters (e.g., L) to maximize information.  \n- Optimal guess: **LEAST** (valid 5-letter word).  \n  - E at position 2 (tests E position).  \n  - S at position 4 and T at position 5 (tests new positions for S and T).  \n  - L at position 1 (new letter).  \n  - A at position 3 (fixed).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down E\'s position and gathers info on T, S, and new letters.\n\n<guess>LEAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TAKES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 3: LEAST -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n1.

(From LEAST feedback, E at 2 is correct, which matches the constraint that E was at 1 or 2? Now we know it is at 2.)\n- From CRANE: E was at position 5 and got (-), so E is not at position 5, which is consistent (now E is at 2).\n- From TAKES: T was at position 1? We put T at 1 in TAKES and got (-), meaning T is not at position 1? But now we see T at position 5? So yes, T is at position 5? \n- Similarly, in TAKES: S was at position 5 and got (-), meaning S is not at position 5? But now we have S at position 4? So it is consistent? \n\nSo the secret word so far: ? E A S T\n\nWe know the first letter is missing, and we must guess it.\n\nWhat do we know about the first letter?\n- It cannot be: C, R, N, K, L (from the x feedback in previous guesses).\n- We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, T, K, S, L (from guesses).\n\nThe first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been eliminated and is in the word? But we don\'t know any other letters? Because the word is 5 letters? And we have four: E, A, S, T? And one missing.\n\nFrom the feedback, we don\'t have any other letters? Because:\n- The word is exactly ? E A S T? \n- And we know that the word contains E, A, S, T? And the first letter? \n\nBut from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is in word? But we didn\'t have the position? Similarly, T and S were missing? \n\nBut now with LEAST: we matched E, A, S, T? So the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been guessed? And it must complete a valid English word? \n\nLetters eliminated: C, R, N, K, L? \n\nWe haven\'t guessed many vowels?

Not. \n\nSo possible first letters: \nB, F, etc? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested B or F? \n\nWe can just guess one of them? \n\nBut note: we have 6 tries? This is guess 4? So we can try? \n\nBut let me list all possibilities? \n\nPossible words:\n- BEAST: B E A S T\n- FEAST: F E A S T\n- HEAST? Not common? \n- GEAST? No\n- VEAST? No\n- PEAST? Not common?\n- etc. \n\nCommon ones are BEAST and FEAST? \n\nWe can guess BEAST? If it is not? Then next? \n\nBut how to decide? \n\nWe have no feedback on B or F? \n\nAlso note: from CRANE: we had E(-) meaning E is present? That was satisfied. \n\nSimilarly, we have T and S? \n\nWe can also consider if there are other possibilities? \n\nFor example, words like ""LEAST"" itself? But we guessed LEAST and got L(x)? So L is not? Therefore, LEAST cannot be the word? \n\nWe are missing the first letter? So ""LEAST"" was our guess? And we got E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) but L(x)? So the word is not LEAST? \n\nSimilarly, it must be ?EAST? \n\nSo guess BEAST? \n\nIf we guess BEAST: \n- If correct, we win? \n- If not, then likely FEAST? \n\nBut to be sure? We can guess BEAST? \n\nBut also, perhaps there is other? Or we might lose a try? But two options? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of other words? \n\nIs there any word like MEAST? Not common? \n\nSo probably BEAST or FEAST? \n\nWe can guess one of them? \n\nLet\'s guess BEAST? \n\nBecause B is common? \n\nSo next guess: BEAST? \n\nBut wait: in our previous guess LEAST, we have E(✓)A(✓)S(✓)T(✓) and L(x)? \n\nSo for BEAST: \n- Position1: B? \n- Position2: E? (we know E is at2? So it should be ✓? \n- Position3: A? ✓ \n- Position4: S? ✓ \n- Position5: T? ✓ \n\nThen the feedback will tell? \n\nIf it is BEAST, all ✓? \n\nIf not, then we get B(x) and then we know it\'s FEAST? \n\nWe have two tries left? So safe? \n\nTherefore, guess BEAST? \n\nBut is BEAST a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo next guess: BEAST? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know if B is present? But it could be? \n\nSo yes? \n\nWe can do that? \n\nAlternatively, is there any elimination? \n\nFrom TAKES: we had A at position2? Got A(-)? But that was because A is at position3?

We have the feedback from five guesses. Let's summarize:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (since CRANE: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: TAKES
- T: in word but wrong position (-) -> T is in the word, not at position 1
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (we already know it's at position 3 from guess 1, so this is consistent)
- K: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4
- S: in word but wrong position (-) -> S is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 3: LEAST
- L: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 2 (LEAST: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5) -> so E is at position 2? But wait, in guess 1 we had A at position 3, and now in LEAST we have A at position 3 and it's correct, and E at position 2 is correct? But in guess 1, E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now we have E at position 2 and it's correct? That seems consistent? But let's check the positions.

Actually, in LEAST:
- Position 1: L -> x (not in word)
- Position 2: E -> ✓ (correct, so E is at position 2)
- Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct, we knew that)
- Position 4: S -> ✓ (correct, so S is at position 4)
- Position 5: T -> ✓ (correct, so T is at position 5)

So the secret word has E at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. The only missing letter is position 1.

Guess 4: BEAST
- B: not in word (x)
- E: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- S: ✓ (position 4)
- T: ✓ (position 5)

So B is not the first letter.

Guess 5: FEAST
- F: not in word (x)
- E: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- S: ✓ (position 4)
- T: ✓ (position 5)

So F is not the first letter.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ E A S T

We have tried L, B, F for the first letter and they are not in the word (or specifically, not the correct first letter). We also know from previous guesses that C, R, N, K are not in the word.

What are the possible first letters? We need a 5-letter word ending with ""EAST"".

Common words:
- BEAST (tried, B not in word)
- FEAST (tried, F not in word)
- YEAST (Y E A S T) -> Y is not eliminated? We haven't tried Y.

Other words? 
- HEAST? Not a common word.
- PEAST? Not common.
- GEAST? No.
- VEAST? No.

But YEAST is a common word meaning a fungus used in baking.

We haven't tried Y. Also, from the feedback, we have no information about Y.

So the next guess should be YEAST.

But let's check if there are other possibilities? 

What about ""LEAST""? We tried LEAST and got L(x) and the other letters correct? So LEAST is not the word because L is not in the word? But we have the same for BEAST and FEAST? 

But YEAST is a valid word.

Alternatively, is there ""WEAST""? Not a word.

So YEAST is the only common word left.

Therefore, we guess YEAST.

But note: in guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now in YEAST, E is at position 2? That's fine? And we have E at position 2? 

Also, in guess 2, we had E at position 4 and got a '-' meaning E is not at 4? Which is consistent? 

So YEAST should be the word.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get? 
- Y at position 1: we don't know? 
- E at 2: ✓
- A at 3: ✓
- S at 4: ✓
- T at 5: ✓

If Y is the first letter and it's correct, then we get all ✓ for the last four? But we don't know about Y? 

But in the feedback, if Y is correct, then all are ✓? 

If not, then we get Y(x) and the rest ✓? 

But we have no other options? 

So we guess YEAST.

But note: we have only 6 tries? This is the 6th guess? 

We have made 5 guesses? So next is the 6th? 

But we must guess? 

So <guess>YEAST</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - Position 3 is **A** (✓).  
  - **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  
  - C, R, N are absent (x).  

- **Guess 2 (TAKES)**:  
  - **T** is present but not at position 1 (-).  
  - **S** is present but not at position 5 (-).  
  - E is not at position 4 (-).  
  - K is absent (x).  

- **Guess 3 (LEAST)**:  
  - Position 2 is **E** (✓), position 3 is **A** (✓), position 4 is **S** (✓), position 5 is **T** (✓).  
  - L is absent (x).  
  - Secret word structure: `[?] E A S T`.  

- **Guess 4 (BEAST)**:  
  - Positions 2–5 (E, A, S, T) are correct (✓).  
  - B is absent (x).  

- **Guess 5 (FEAST)**:  
  - Positions 2–5 (E, A, S, T) are correct (✓).  
  - F is absent (x).  

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `[?] E A S T`.  
- Position 1 cannot be **C, R, N, K, L, B, F** (all eliminated via ""x"" feedback).  
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **YEAST** (a valid 5-letter word).  

### Final Guess (6th Attempt):
- **YEAST** is the only viable option. It matches all constraints:  
  - Position 1: **Y** (untested letter, not eliminated).  
  - Positions 2–5: **E, A, S, T** (confirmed correct in previous guesses).  

<guess>YEAST</guess>",YEAST,"We have the feedback from five guesses. Let's summarize:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (since CRANE: C1, R2, A3, N4, E5)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: TAKES
- T: in word but wrong position (-) -> T is in the word, not at position 1
- A: in word but wrong position (-) -> A is in the word, but not at position 2 (we already know it's at position 3 from guess 1, so this is consistent)
- K: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> E is in the word, but not at position 4
- S: in word but wrong position (-) -> S is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 3: LEAST
- L: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 2 (LEAST: L1, E2, A3, S4, T5) -> so E is at position 2? But wait, in guess 1 we had A at position 3, and now in LEAST we have A at position 3 and it's correct, and E at position 2 is correct? But in guess 1, E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now we have E at position 2 and it's correct? That seems consistent? But let's check the positions.

Actually, in LEAST:
- Position 1: L -> x (not in word)
- Position 2: E -> ✓ (correct, so E is at position 2)
- Position 3: A -> ✓ (correct, we knew that)
- Position 4: S -> ✓ (correct, so S is at position 4)
- Position 5: T -> ✓ (correct, so T is at position 5)

So the secret word has E at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. The only missing letter is position 1.

Guess 4: BEAST
- B: not in word (x)
- E: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- S: ✓ (position 4)
- T: ✓ (position 5)

So B is not the first letter.

Guess 5: FEAST
- F: not in word (x)
- E: ✓ (position 2)
- A: ✓ (position 3)
- S: ✓ (position 4)
- T: ✓ (position 5)

So F is not the first letter.

Now, the secret word is of the form: _ E A S T

We have tried L, B, F for the first letter and they are not in the word (or specifically, not the correct first letter). We also know from previous guesses that C, R, N, K are not in the word.

What are the possible first letters? We need a 5-letter word ending with ""EAST"".

Common words:
- BEAST (tried, B not in word)
- FEAST (tried, F not in word)
- YEAST (Y E A S T) -> Y is not eliminated? We haven't tried Y.

Other words? 
- HEAST? Not a common word.
- PEAST? Not common.
- GEAST? No.
- VEAST? No.

But YEAST is a common word meaning a fungus used in baking.

We haven't tried Y. Also, from the feedback, we have no information about Y.

So the next guess should be YEAST.

But let's check if there are other possibilities? 

What about ""LEAST""? We tried LEAST and got L(x) and the other letters correct? So LEAST is not the word because L is not in the word? But we have the same for BEAST and FEAST? 

But YEAST is a valid word.

Alternatively, is there ""WEAST""? Not a word.

So YEAST is the only common word left.

Therefore, we guess YEAST.

But note: in guess 1, we had E at position 5 and got a '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now in YEAST, E is at position 2? That's fine? And we have E at position 2? 

Also, in guess 2, we had E at position 4 and got a '-' meaning E is not at 4? Which is consistent? 

So YEAST should be the word.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get? 
- Y at position 1: we don't know? 
- E at 2: ✓
- A at 3: ✓
- S at 4: ✓
- T at 5: ✓

If Y is the first letter and it's correct, then we get all ✓ for the last four? But we don't know about Y? 

But in the feedback, if Y is correct, then all are ✓? 

If not, then we get Y(x) and the rest ✓? 

But we have no other options? 

So we guess YEAST.

But note: we have only 6 tries? This is the 6th guess? 

We have made 5 guesses? So next is the 6th? 

But we must guess? 

So <guess>YEAST</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:  
  - Position 3 is **A** (✓).  
  - **E** is in the word but not at position 5 (-).  
  - C, R, N are absent (x).  

- **Guess 2 (TAKES)**:  
  - **T** is present but not at position 1 (-).  
  - **S** is present but not at position 5 (-).  
  - E is not at position 4 (-).  
  - K is absent (x).  

- **Guess 3 (LEAST)**:  
  - Position 2 is **E** (✓), position 3 is **A** (✓), position 4 is **S** (✓), position 5 is **T** (✓).  
  - L is absent (x).  
  - Secret word structure: `[?] E A S T`.  

- **Guess 4 (BEAST)**:  
  - Positions 2–5 (E, A, S, T) are correct (✓).  
  - B is absent (x).  

- **Guess 5 (FEAST)**:  
  - Positions 2–5 (E, A, S, T) are correct (✓).  
  - F is absent (x).  

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `[?] E A S T`.  
- Position 1 cannot be **C, R, N, K, L, B, F** (all eliminated via ""x"" feedback).  
- The only common English word fitting this pattern is **YEAST** (a valid 5-letter word).  

### Final Guess (6th Attempt):
- **YEAST** is the only viable option. It matches all constraints:  
  - Position 1: **Y** (untested letter, not eliminated).  
  - Positions 2–5: **E, A, S, T** (confirmed correct in previous guesses).",Guess 6: YEAST -> FEEDBACK: Y(✓) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
