We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4 -> '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 However, we don't know the secret word. We are just starting.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these words are acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the instructions say: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So we will output: <guess>RAISE</guess>
</think>
For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.

<guess>COAST</guess>",COAST,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.",Guess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,swash,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4 -> '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 However, we don't know the secret word. We are just starting.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these words are acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the instructions say: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So we will output: <guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.

But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S\'s, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don\'t specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4.

We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.\n\nSo I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWe have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.\n\nBOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.\n\nFLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.\n\nWe want to cover more consonants. Let\'s choose a word that has letters that are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let\'s try to include T, L, C, etc.\n\nBOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.\nCOAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.\nFLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.\nCLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.\n\nAmong these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.\n\nBut note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That\'s a candidate position.\n\nIn the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.\n\nBut we have to have S at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.\n\nWords ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.\n\nBut common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.\n\nOr CONSA? Not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard. So we stick with A at position 3.\n\nNow, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let\'s choose COAST because C is a common letter.\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.\n\nABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we would be testing B and Y.\n\nBut Y is less common. So maybe not.\n\nAnother word: A C T S ? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nHow about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut note: COAST has O. We haven\'t tested O before. It\'s a vowel and common.\n\nSo I think COAST is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word COAST: \n  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.\n\nWe know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don\'t have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).\n\nBut we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.\n\nSo that\'s good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose COAST.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.\n\nSo the guess is COAST.\n\nNow, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").\n- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).\n- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.\n- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I chose **COAST** because:\n  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).\n  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).\n  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.\n  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.\n\n<guess>COAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - This told us:
     - R, I, E are not in the word.
     - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (since it was marked correct in position 4).

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - C, O, T are not in the word (x).
     - A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and marked correct).
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (same as before).

From both guesses, we now know:

- The secret word contains letters: A (at position 3), S (at position 4).
- The secret word does NOT contain: R, I, E, C, O, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we knew A was not at position 2, and now we know it is at position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We know:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S

So the secret word has the form: _ _ A S _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are not forbidden and are in the word.

Forbidden letters (so far): R, I, E, C, O, T.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to find possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T.

So letters from the first two guesses: A, C, E, I, O, R, S, T.

We know A and S are in the word (fixed positions), and the others are out.

Now, we must use new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We want to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ A S _ and uses letters not in the forbidden set.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form __AS_.

Let me think of words ending with ""AS"": actually, our word has ""AS"" at positions 3-4, so it must be followed by a letter at position 5.

Pattern: __A S _

Some possibilities:

- First two letters: we have to fill with two letters, and then the last letter.

Common words:

- CLASS? That has two S's? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don't know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven't been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven't tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.

- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn't have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S's. And we know S is at position 4, but we don't know if there's another S at position 5. Also, we haven't tested G or L.

But is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn't have T. But it has two S's.

However, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn't match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _

So last letter is something after AS.

Words like:

- ALMAS? Not common.
- BAPUS? Not a word.
- BASS: but it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Common 5-letter words:

- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`

Examples:

- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.

But we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?

- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)

- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A's? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there's an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A's? It's possible.

But ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QANAT? Not matching.

And SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.

But wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.

So SHALL doesn't fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.

So not.

Another one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.

Not matching.

Back to FLASH and GNASH.

But we also have words like:

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.

But we don't know.

Another: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.

Now, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.

We have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.

We need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.

In the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.

But we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.

For the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried and fits the pattern.

Let's list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.

Forbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.

So allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

Possible words:

- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H
- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H
- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H
- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H
- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).

Other options:

- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.
- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.

Also, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don't know if it's allowed or if it's the same A.

But it's a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.

Another word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.

- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn't fit.

Another: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.

We also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.

So possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.

We need to pick one that helps us test the most.

But note: we don't know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it's not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.

We want to test new letters.

For example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.

GNASH: tests G, N, H.

PLASH: tests P, L, H.

SLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.

Since we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:

- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.
- If it has two S's, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:

If the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:
  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.

Standard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it's in the word, it would be present.

But in our case, we don't know if there is an L or not.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.

So let's delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.

ABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A's, so duplicate A.

So duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.

Words without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

We can choose any.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

FLASH: F is not very common, L is common.

GNASH: G and N, N common.

PLASH: P is common, L common.

But note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.

We don't know if H is in the word.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.

Let me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.

But another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.

Similarly, GNASH tests G and N.

As per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.

But F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.

So N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).

FLASH: F (2%), L (4%).

So GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.

GHASH? Not a word.

We also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.

Not matching pattern.

Another: WRASH? Not common.

So between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

I think FLASH is a familiar word? So I'll go with FLASH.

But PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it's acceptable.

Another option: HALAS? Not pattern.

So FLASH.

But FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)

Now, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.

So we can input FLASH.

We hope to get feedback on F, L, H.

If any are in the word, we get - or ✓.

Therefore, I choose FLASH.

But note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.

So guess: FLASH.

Now, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.

Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).
2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.
3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).

For the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.
- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven't been used yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).
- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.

<guess>FLASH</guess>",FLASH,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - This told us:
     - R, I, E are not in the word.
     - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (since it was marked correct in position 4).

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - C, O, T are not in the word (x).
     - A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and marked correct).
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (same as before).

From both guesses, we now know:

- The secret word contains letters: A (at position 3), S (at position 4).
- The secret word does NOT contain: R, I, E, C, O, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we knew A was not at position 2, and now we know it is at position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We know:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S

So the secret word has the form: _ _ A S _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are not forbidden and are in the word.

Forbidden letters (so far): R, I, E, C, O, T.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to find possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T.

So letters from the first two guesses: A, C, E, I, O, R, S, T.

We know A and S are in the word (fixed positions), and the others are out.

Now, we must use new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We want to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ A S _ and uses letters not in the forbidden set.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form __AS_.

Let me think of words ending with ""AS"": actually, our word has ""AS"" at positions 3-4, so it must be followed by a letter at position 5.

Pattern: __A S _

Some possibilities:

- First two letters: we have to fill with two letters, and then the last letter.

Common words:

- CLASS? That has two S's? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don't know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven't been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven't tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.

- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn't have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S's. And we know S is at position 4, but we don't know if there's another S at position 5. Also, we haven't tested G or L.

But is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn't have T. But it has two S's.

However, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn't match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _

So last letter is something after AS.

Words like:

- ALMAS? Not common.
- BAPUS? Not a word.
- BASS: but it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Common 5-letter words:

- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`

Examples:

- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.

But we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?

- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)

- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A's? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there's an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A's? It's possible.

But ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QANAT? Not matching.

And SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.

But wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.

So SHALL doesn't fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.

So not.

Another one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.

Not matching.

Back to FLASH and GNASH.

But we also have words like:

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.

But we don't know.

Another: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.

Now, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.

We have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.

We need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.

In the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.

But we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.

For the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried and fits the pattern.

Let's list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.

Forbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.

So allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

Possible words:

- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H
- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H
- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H
- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H
- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).

Other options:

- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.
- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.

Also, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don't know if it's allowed or if it's the same A.

But it's a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.

Another word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.

- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn't fit.

Another: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.

We also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.

So possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.

We need to pick one that helps us test the most.

But note: we don't know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it's not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.

We want to test new letters.

For example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.

GNASH: tests G, N, H.

PLASH: tests P, L, H.

SLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.

Since we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:

- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.
- If it has two S's, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:

If the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:
  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.

Standard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it's in the word, it would be present.

But in our case, we don't know if there is an L or not.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.

So let's delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.

ABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A's, so duplicate A.

So duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.

Words without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

We can choose any.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

FLASH: F is not very common, L is common.

GNASH: G and N, N common.

PLASH: P is common, L common.

But note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.

We don't know if H is in the word.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.

Let me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.

But another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.

Similarly, GNASH tests G and N.

As per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.

But F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.

So N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).

FLASH: F (2%), L (4%).

So GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.

GHASH? Not a word.

We also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.

Not matching pattern.

Another: WRASH? Not common.

So between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

I think FLASH is a familiar word? So I'll go with FLASH.

But PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it's acceptable.

Another option: HALAS? Not pattern.

So FLASH.

But FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)

Now, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.

So we can input FLASH.

We hope to get feedback on F, L, H.

If any are in the word, we get - or ✓.

Therefore, I choose FLASH.

But note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.

So guess: FLASH.

Now, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.

Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).
2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.
3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).

For the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.
- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven't been used yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).
- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.",Guess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4 -> '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 However, we don't know the secret word. We are just starting.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these words are acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the instructions say: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So we will output: <guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.

<guess>COAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - This told us:
     - R, I, E are not in the word.
     - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (since it was marked correct in position 4).

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - C, O, T are not in the word (x).
     - A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and marked correct).
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (same as before).

From both guesses, we now know:

- The secret word contains letters: A (at position 3), S (at position 4).
- The secret word does NOT contain: R, I, E, C, O, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we knew A was not at position 2, and now we know it is at position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We know:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S

So the secret word has the form: _ _ A S _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are not forbidden and are in the word.

Forbidden letters (so far): R, I, E, C, O, T.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to find possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T.

So letters from the first two guesses: A, C, E, I, O, R, S, T.

We know A and S are in the word (fixed positions), and the others are out.

Now, we must use new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We want to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ A S _ and uses letters not in the forbidden set.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form __AS_.

Let me think of words ending with ""AS"": actually, our word has ""AS"" at positions 3-4, so it must be followed by a letter at position 5.

Pattern: __A S _

Some possibilities:

- First two letters: we have to fill with two letters, and then the last letter.

Common words:

- CLASS? That has two S's? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don't know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven't been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven't tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.

- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn't have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S's. And we know S is at position 4, but we don't know if there's another S at position 5. Also, we haven't tested G or L.

But is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn't have T. But it has two S's.

However, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn't match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _

So last letter is something after AS.

Words like:

- ALMAS? Not common.
- BAPUS? Not a word.
- BASS: but it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Common 5-letter words:

- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`

Examples:

- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.

But we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?

- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)

- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A's? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there's an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A's? It's possible.

But ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QANAT? Not matching.

And SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.

But wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.

So SHALL doesn't fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.

So not.

Another one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.

Not matching.

Back to FLASH and GNASH.

But we also have words like:

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.

But we don't know.

Another: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.

Now, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.

We have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.

We need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.

In the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.

But we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.

For the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried and fits the pattern.

Let's list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.

Forbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.

So allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

Possible words:

- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H
- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H
- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H
- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H
- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).

Other options:

- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.
- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.

Also, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don't know if it's allowed or if it's the same A.

But it's a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.

Another word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.

- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn't fit.

Another: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.

We also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.

So possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.

We need to pick one that helps us test the most.

But note: we don't know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it's not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.

We want to test new letters.

For example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.

GNASH: tests G, N, H.

PLASH: tests P, L, H.

SLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.

Since we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:

- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.
- If it has two S's, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:

If the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:
  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.

Standard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it's in the word, it would be present.

But in our case, we don't know if there is an L or not.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.

So let's delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.

ABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A's, so duplicate A.

So duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.

Words without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

We can choose any.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

FLASH: F is not very common, L is common.

GNASH: G and N, N common.

PLASH: P is common, L common.

But note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.

We don't know if H is in the word.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.

Let me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.

But another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.

Similarly, GNASH tests G and N.

As per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.

But F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.

So N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).

FLASH: F (2%), L (4%).

So GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.

GHASH? Not a word.

We also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.

Not matching pattern.

Another: WRASH? Not common.

So between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

I think FLASH is a familiar word? So I'll go with FLASH.

But PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it's acceptable.

Another option: HALAS? Not pattern.

So FLASH.

But FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)

Now, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.

So we can input FLASH.

We hope to get feedback on F, L, H.

If any are in the word, we get - or ✓.

Therefore, I choose FLASH.

But note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.

So guess: FLASH.

Now, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.

Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).
2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.
3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).

For the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.
- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven't been used yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).
- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.

Let\'s clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.\n\n  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.\n\n  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).\n  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that\'s taken by S).\n  - Does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E.

But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S\'s, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don\'t specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.\n\nBut for the second guess, we want to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S\'s and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.\n  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.\n  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that\'s not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.\n\nWe need to avoid R, I, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).\n\nActually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].\n\nWe need to fill in the blanks.\n\nConstraints:\n  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was \'x\', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).\n  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that\'s S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _\n  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don\'t know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.\n  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). \n  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - How about AULOS? Not common. \n  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]\n\nSo for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]\n  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S\'s and Y, and it\'s 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let\'s check: \n      A: present and at position 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. \n  - But ABYSS has two S\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.\n\nAnother candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - ADOBS? Not a word.\n  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.\n\nAnother idea: A N K H S? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]\n  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nExamples:\n  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.\n\nBOAST: \n  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).\n\nAnother candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.\n\nOr D O A S T? Not common.\n\nOr F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.\n\nOr SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.\n\nBut we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S\'s, but if it doesn\'t, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.\n\nBut for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.\n\nSo let\'s consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.\n\nNow, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A\n  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. \n  - M A N S A? Not common. \n  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? \n  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. \n  - It\'s hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.\n\nSo the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.\n\nWe also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S.\n\nSo let me list:\n  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.\n  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.\n  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.\n  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.\n  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven\'t used C or L.\n  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S\'s. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.\n\nSo I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWe have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.\n\nBOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.\n\nFLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.\n\nWe want to cover more consonants. Let\'s choose a word that has letters that are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let\'s try to include T, L, C, etc.\n\nBOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.\nCOAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.\nFLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.\nCLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.\n\nAmong these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.\n\nBut note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That\'s a candidate position.\n\nIn the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.\n\nBut we have to have S at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.\n\nWords ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.\n\nBut common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.\n\nOr CONSA? Not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard. So we stick with A at position 3.\n\nNow, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let\'s choose COAST because C is a common letter.\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.\n\nABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we would be testing B and Y.\n\nBut Y is less common. So maybe not.\n\nAnother word: A C T S ? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nHow about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut note: COAST has O. We haven\'t tested O before. It\'s a vowel and common.\n\nSo I think COAST is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word COAST: \n  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.\n\nWe know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don\'t have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).\n\nBut we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.\n\nSo that\'s good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose COAST.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.\n\nSo the guess is COAST.\n\nNow, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").\n- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).\n- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.\n- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I chose **COAST** because:\n  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).\n  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).\n  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.\n  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.\n\n<guess>COAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

That has two S\'s? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven\'t been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven\'t tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.\n\n- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn\'t have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S\'s. And we know S is at position 4, but we don\'t know if there\'s another S at position 5. Also, we haven\'t tested G or L.\n\nBut is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn\'t have T. But it has two S\'s.\n\nHowever, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn\'t match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _\n\nSo last letter is something after AS.\n\nWords like:\n\n- ALMAS? Not common.\n- BAPUS? Not a word.\n- BASS: but it\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nCommon 5-letter words:\n\n- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`\n\nExamples:\n\n- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.\n\nBut we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?\n\n- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)\n\n- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A\'s? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there\'s an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nBut ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nAnother word: QANAT? Not matching.\n\nAnd SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.\n\nBut wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.\n\nSo SHALL doesn\'t fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nBack to FLASH and GNASH.\n\nBut we also have words like:\n\n- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.\n\nWe have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nWe need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.\n\nBut we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.\n\nFor the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.\n\nForbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.\n\nSo allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H\n- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H\n- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H\n- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H\n- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).\n\nOther options:\n\n- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.\n- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.\n\nAlso, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don\'t know if it\'s allowed or if it\'s the same A.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.\n\nAnother word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.\n\n- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.\n\nWe also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.\n\nSo possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.\n\nWe need to pick one that helps us test the most.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.\n\nWe want to test new letters.\n\nFor example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.\n\nGNASH: tests G, N, H.\n\nPLASH: tests P, L, H.\n\nSLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.\n\nSince we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:\n\n- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.\n- If it has two S\'s, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:\n\nIf the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:\n  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.\n\nStandard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it\'s in the word, it would be present.\n\nBut in our case, we don\'t know if there is an L or not.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.\n\nABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A\'s, so duplicate A.\n\nSo duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.\n\nWords without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nNow, which one? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.\n\nFLASH: F is not very common, L is common.\n\nGNASH: G and N, N common.\n\nPLASH: P is common, L common.\n\nBut note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.\n\nWe don\'t know if H is in the word.\n\nWe can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.\n\nLet me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.\n\nBut another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.\n\nSimilarly, GNASH tests G and N.\n\nAs per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.\n\nBut F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.\n\nSo N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).\n\nFLASH: F (2%), L (4%).\n\nSo GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.\n\nGHASH? Not a word.\n\nWe also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.\n\nNot matching pattern.\n\nAnother: WRASH? Not common.\n\nSo between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nI think FLASH is a familiar word? So I\'ll go with FLASH.\n\nBut PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother option: HALAS? Not pattern.\n\nSo FLASH.\n\nBut FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)\n\nNow, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.\n\nSo we can input FLASH.\n\nWe hope to get feedback on F, L, H.\n\nIf any are in the word, we get - or ✓.\n\nTherefore, I choose FLASH.\n\nBut note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nSo guess: FLASH.\n\nNow, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.\n- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.\n\nDeductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).\n2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.\n3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.\n- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven\'t been used yet.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).\n- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.\n\n<guess>FLASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E are absent.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S is present and at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T are absent.
   - A is present and at position 3 (so now we know A is at position 3).
   - S is present and at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F and L are absent.
   - A is at position 3 (correct, so we already knew that).
   - S is at position 4 (correct, known).
   - H is present and at position 5 (so now we know the fifth letter is H).

From the feedback of the third guess, we have:
- H is in the word and at position 5.

So now we know the secret word is: _ _ A S H

We know the positions:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: H

We need to find the first two letters.

We also know the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

So the absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

We must choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining letters that are not in the absent set.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have used the following letters in guesses (and know their status):

- A: present (at position 3)
- S: present (at position 4)
- H: present (at position 5)
- R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L: absent.

So the remaining letters (not used and not absent) are: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2] A S H

We need to find a valid English word that matches this pattern and uses letters from the remaining set.

Let's list possible words:

- BASH: B A S H -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The pattern is _ _ A S H, so two letters before ""A"", so it must be 5 letters.

So words ending with ""ASH"": but we have two letters before A.

Examples:

- DASH: D A S H -> again, 4 letters? No, DASH is 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words ending with ""ASH"" are not common? Actually, we have:

- ABASH: A B A S H -> but we have A at position 1? And A at position 3? But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don't know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven't ruled it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A's. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.

But in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.

But we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven't tested B, and it's not in the absent list. So B is allowed.

But ABASH has A at position 1? We don't know if that is correct.

Another word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S's. But we don't know if the secret has two S's. Also, M is a new letter.

But SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.

But we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.

However, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.

But let's list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.

Other words:

- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven't tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.

- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.

- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.

- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.

But we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn't have L. So it's S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that's fine.

But we are using S at position 1.

Now, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.

- SQUASH? That's 6 letters.

- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.

But we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

We also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.

Another: PASH? 4 letters.

We need 5.

Let me think of more words:

- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn't match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.

- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.

So the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H

Common words:

- ABASH
- AWASH
- GNASH
- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)
- SWASH (duplicate S)
- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.
- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.
- CRASH? C and R absent.
- DRASH? Not common.

So the candidates from the remaining letters:

- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B
- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W
- GNASH: G, N
- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M
- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W

We also have:

- KAPAS? Not matching.
- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.

Another: GAZSH? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).

We can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.

But let's see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.

But we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.

For example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.

Similarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.

So if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.

If we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.

But we don't have much information about the first two letters.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.

So we have to use A, S, H.

The only freedom is the first two letters.

We can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.

If we guess GNASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

For example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don't know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a '-' for G. Similarly for N.

But we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.

Similarly for N.

So that would be very informative.

Whereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn't have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it's not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.

But we are limited on guesses.

I think GNASH is a good candidate.

We also have other words like:

- MNASH? Not a word.
- PNASH? Not.

So let's go with GNASH.

But GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.

So I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, we guess GNASH.

But let's confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.

And letters: G and N are not in the absent list.

So we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>

If it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

But we hope it is correct.

Alternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.

Another word: DASH + something? Not.

I think GNASH is a good choice.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  
  Insights:  
  - R, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4.  

- **Guess 2: COAST**  
  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - C, O, T are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  

- **Guess 3: FLASH**  
  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - F, L are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H is **correct** at position 5.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
   - Position 3: **A**  
   - Position 4: **S**  
   - Position 5: **H**  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L (from all feedback).  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  
   - Available letters (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - We need a valid 5-letter English word matching `_ _ A S H`.  

4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words):  
   - **GNASH**: G N A S H (fits pattern, tests new letters G and N).  
   - **ABASH**: A B A S H (tests duplicate A and B, but A at position 1 is uncertain).  
   - **AWASH**: A W A S H (tests duplicate A and W).  
   - **SMASH**: S M A S H (tests duplicate S and M).  
   - **SWASH**: S W A S H (tests duplicate S and W).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test new letters and avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty.  
  - **GNASH** is optimal because:  
    - It uses **G** and **N** (common consonants not tested yet).  
    - No duplicate letters (unlike ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH), ensuring cleaner feedback.  
    - If incorrect, feedback on G and N will directly reveal their status (present/absent) and positions, narrowing the possibilities to 1-2 remaining words.  
- **Why not others?**  
  - **ABASH/AWASH**: Risk of duplicate A (unknown if secret has two A's).  
  - **SMASH/SWASH**: Risk of duplicate S (S is already fixed at position 4).  

Given the pattern `_ _ A S H` and absent letters, **GNASH** is a strong guess to maximize information or solve the puzzle.

<guess>GNASH</guess>",GNASH,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E are absent.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S is present and at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T are absent.
   - A is present and at position 3 (so now we know A is at position 3).
   - S is present and at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F and L are absent.
   - A is at position 3 (correct, so we already knew that).
   - S is at position 4 (correct, known).
   - H is present and at position 5 (so now we know the fifth letter is H).

From the feedback of the third guess, we have:
- H is in the word and at position 5.

So now we know the secret word is: _ _ A S H

We know the positions:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: H

We need to find the first two letters.

We also know the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

So the absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

We must choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining letters that are not in the absent set.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have used the following letters in guesses (and know their status):

- A: present (at position 3)
- S: present (at position 4)
- H: present (at position 5)
- R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L: absent.

So the remaining letters (not used and not absent) are: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2] A S H

We need to find a valid English word that matches this pattern and uses letters from the remaining set.

Let's list possible words:

- BASH: B A S H -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The pattern is _ _ A S H, so two letters before ""A"", so it must be 5 letters.

So words ending with ""ASH"": but we have two letters before A.

Examples:

- DASH: D A S H -> again, 4 letters? No, DASH is 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words ending with ""ASH"" are not common? Actually, we have:

- ABASH: A B A S H -> but we have A at position 1? And A at position 3? But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don't know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven't ruled it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A's. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.

But in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.

But we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven't tested B, and it's not in the absent list. So B is allowed.

But ABASH has A at position 1? We don't know if that is correct.

Another word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S's. But we don't know if the secret has two S's. Also, M is a new letter.

But SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.

But we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.

However, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.

But let's list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.

Other words:

- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven't tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.

- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.

- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.

- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.

But we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn't have L. So it's S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that's fine.

But we are using S at position 1.

Now, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.

- SQUASH? That's 6 letters.

- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.

But we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

We also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.

Another: PASH? 4 letters.

We need 5.

Let me think of more words:

- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn't match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.

- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.

So the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H

Common words:

- ABASH
- AWASH
- GNASH
- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)
- SWASH (duplicate S)
- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.
- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.
- CRASH? C and R absent.
- DRASH? Not common.

So the candidates from the remaining letters:

- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B
- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W
- GNASH: G, N
- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M
- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W

We also have:

- KAPAS? Not matching.
- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.

Another: GAZSH? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).

We can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.

But let's see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.

But we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.

For example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.

Similarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.

So if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.

If we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.

But we don't have much information about the first two letters.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.

So we have to use A, S, H.

The only freedom is the first two letters.

We can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.

If we guess GNASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

For example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don't know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a '-' for G. Similarly for N.

But we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.

Similarly for N.

So that would be very informative.

Whereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn't have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it's not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.

But we are limited on guesses.

I think GNASH is a good candidate.

We also have other words like:

- MNASH? Not a word.
- PNASH? Not.

So let's go with GNASH.

But GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.

So I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, we guess GNASH.

But let's confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.

And letters: G and N are not in the absent list.

So we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>

If it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

But we hope it is correct.

Alternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.

Another word: DASH + something? Not.

I think GNASH is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4 -> '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 However, we don't know the secret word. We are just starting.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these words are acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the instructions say: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So we will output: <guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.

<guess>COAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - This told us:
     - R, I, E are not in the word.
     - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (since it was marked correct in position 4).

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - C, O, T are not in the word (x).
     - A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and marked correct).
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (same as before).

From both guesses, we now know:

- The secret word contains letters: A (at position 3), S (at position 4).
- The secret word does NOT contain: R, I, E, C, O, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we knew A was not at position 2, and now we know it is at position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We know:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S

So the secret word has the form: _ _ A S _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are not forbidden and are in the word.

Forbidden letters (so far): R, I, E, C, O, T.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to find possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T.

So letters from the first two guesses: A, C, E, I, O, R, S, T.

We know A and S are in the word (fixed positions), and the others are out.

Now, we must use new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We want to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ A S _ and uses letters not in the forbidden set.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form __AS_.

Let me think of words ending with ""AS"": actually, our word has ""AS"" at positions 3-4, so it must be followed by a letter at position 5.

Pattern: __A S _

Some possibilities:

- First two letters: we have to fill with two letters, and then the last letter.

Common words:

- CLASS? That has two S's? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don't know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven't been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven't tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.

- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn't have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S's. And we know S is at position 4, but we don't know if there's another S at position 5. Also, we haven't tested G or L.

But is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn't have T. But it has two S's.

However, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn't match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _

So last letter is something after AS.

Words like:

- ALMAS? Not common.
- BAPUS? Not a word.
- BASS: but it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Common 5-letter words:

- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`

Examples:

- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.

But we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?

- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)

- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A's? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there's an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A's? It's possible.

But ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QANAT? Not matching.

And SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.

But wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.

So SHALL doesn't fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.

So not.

Another one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.

Not matching.

Back to FLASH and GNASH.

But we also have words like:

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.

But we don't know.

Another: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.

Now, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.

We have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.

We need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.

In the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.

But we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.

For the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried and fits the pattern.

Let's list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.

Forbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.

So allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

Possible words:

- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H
- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H
- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H
- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H
- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).

Other options:

- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.
- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.

Also, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don't know if it's allowed or if it's the same A.

But it's a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.

Another word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.

- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn't fit.

Another: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.

We also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.

So possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.

We need to pick one that helps us test the most.

But note: we don't know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it's not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.

We want to test new letters.

For example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.

GNASH: tests G, N, H.

PLASH: tests P, L, H.

SLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.

Since we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:

- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.
- If it has two S's, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:

If the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:
  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.

Standard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it's in the word, it would be present.

But in our case, we don't know if there is an L or not.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.

So let's delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.

ABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A's, so duplicate A.

So duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.

Words without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

We can choose any.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

FLASH: F is not very common, L is common.

GNASH: G and N, N common.

PLASH: P is common, L common.

But note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.

We don't know if H is in the word.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.

Let me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.

But another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.

Similarly, GNASH tests G and N.

As per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.

But F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.

So N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).

FLASH: F (2%), L (4%).

So GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.

GHASH? Not a word.

We also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.

Not matching pattern.

Another: WRASH? Not common.

So between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

I think FLASH is a familiar word? So I'll go with FLASH.

But PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it's acceptable.

Another option: HALAS? Not pattern.

So FLASH.

But FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)

Now, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.

So we can input FLASH.

We hope to get feedback on F, L, H.

If any are in the word, we get - or ✓.

Therefore, I choose FLASH.

But note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.

So guess: FLASH.

Now, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.

Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).
2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.
3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).

For the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.
- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven't been used yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).
- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E are absent.
   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S is present and at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T are absent.
   - A is present and at position 3 (so now we know A is at position 3).
   - S is present and at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F and L are absent.
   - A is at position 3 (correct, so we already knew that).
   - S is at position 4 (correct, known).
   - H is present and at position 5 (so now we know the fifth letter is H).

From the feedback of the third guess, we have:
- H is in the word and at position 5.

So now we know the secret word is: _ _ A S H

We know the positions:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: H

We need to find the first two letters.

We also know the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

So the absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

We must choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining letters that are not in the absent set.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have used the following letters in guesses (and know their status):

- A: present (at position 3)
- S: present (at position 4)
- H: present (at position 5)
- R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L: absent.

So the remaining letters (not used and not absent) are: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2] A S H

We need to find a valid English word that matches this pattern and uses letters from the remaining set.

Let's list possible words:

- BASH: B A S H -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The pattern is _ _ A S H, so two letters before ""A"", so it must be 5 letters.

So words ending with ""ASH"": but we have two letters before A.

Examples:

- DASH: D A S H -> again, 4 letters? No, DASH is 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words ending with ""ASH"" are not common? Actually, we have:

- ABASH: A B A S H -> but we have A at position 1? And A at position 3? But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don't know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven't ruled it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A's. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.

But in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.

But we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven't tested B, and it's not in the absent list. So B is allowed.

But ABASH has A at position 1? We don't know if that is correct.

Another word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S's. But we don't know if the secret has two S's. Also, M is a new letter.

But SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.

But we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.

However, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.

But let's list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.

Other words:

- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven't tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.

- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.

- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.

- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.

But we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn't have L. So it's S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that's fine.

But we are using S at position 1.

Now, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.

- SQUASH? That's 6 letters.

- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.

But we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

We also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.

Another: PASH? 4 letters.

We need 5.

Let me think of more words:

- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn't match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.

- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.

So the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H

Common words:

- ABASH
- AWASH
- GNASH
- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)
- SWASH (duplicate S)
- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.
- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.
- CRASH? C and R absent.
- DRASH? Not common.

So the candidates from the remaining letters:

- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B
- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W
- GNASH: G, N
- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M
- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W

We also have:

- KAPAS? Not matching.
- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.

Another: GAZSH? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).

We can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.

But let's see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.

But we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.

For example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.

Similarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.

So if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.

If we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.

But we don't have much information about the first two letters.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.

So we have to use A, S, H.

The only freedom is the first two letters.

We can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.

If we guess GNASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

For example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don't know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a '-' for G. Similarly for N.

But we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.

Similarly for N.

So that would be very informative.

Whereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn't have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it's not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.

But we are limited on guesses.

I think GNASH is a good candidate.

We also have other words like:

- MNASH? Not a word.
- PNASH? Not.

So let's go with GNASH.

But GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.

So I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, we guess GNASH.

But let's confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.

And letters: G and N are not in the absent list.

So we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>

If it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

But we hope it is correct.

Alternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.

Another word: DASH + something? Not.

I think GNASH is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  
  Insights:  
  - R, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4.  

- **Guess 2: COAST**  
  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - C, O, T are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  

- **Guess 3: FLASH**  
  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - F, L are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H is **correct** at position 5.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
   - Position 3: **A**  
   - Position 4: **S**  
   - Position 5: **H**  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L (from all feedback).  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  
   - Available letters (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - We need a valid 5-letter English word matching `_ _ A S H`.  

4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words):  
   - **GNASH**: G N A S H (fits pattern, tests new letters G and N).  
   - **ABASH**: A B A S H (tests duplicate A and B, but A at position 1 is uncertain).  
   - **AWASH**: A W A S H (tests duplicate A and W).  
   - **SMASH**: S M A S H (tests duplicate S and M).  
   - **SWASH**: S W A S H (tests duplicate S and W).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test new letters and avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty.  
  - **GNASH** is optimal because:  
    - It uses **G** and **N** (common consonants not tested yet).  
    - No duplicate letters (unlike ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH), ensuring cleaner feedback.  
    - If incorrect, feedback on G and N will directly reveal their status (present/absent) and positions, narrowing the possibilities to 1-2 remaining words.  
- **Why not others?**  
  - **ABASH/AWASH**: Risk of duplicate A (unknown if secret has two A's).  
  - **SMASH/SWASH**: Risk of duplicate S (S is already fixed at position 4).  

Given the pattern `_ _ A S H` and absent letters, **GNASH** is a strong guess to maximize information or solve the puzzle.

But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S\'s, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don\'t specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.\n\nBut for the second guess, we want to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S\'s and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.\n  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.\n  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that\'s not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.\n\nWe need to avoid R, I, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).\n\nActually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].\n\nWe need to fill in the blanks.\n\nConstraints:\n  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was \'x\', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).\n  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that\'s S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _\n  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don\'t know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.\n  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). \n  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - How about AULOS? Not common. \n  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]\n\nSo for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]\n  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S\'s and Y, and it\'s 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let\'s check: \n      A: present and at position 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. \n  - But ABYSS has two S\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.\n\nAnother candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - ADOBS? Not a word.\n  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.\n\nAnother idea: A N K H S? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]\n  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nExamples:\n  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.\n\nBOAST: \n  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).\n\nAnother candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.\n\nOr D O A S T? Not common.\n\nOr F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.\n\nOr SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.\n\nBut we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S\'s, but if it doesn\'t, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.\n\nBut for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.\n\nSo let\'s consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.\n\nNow, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A\n  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. \n  - M A N S A? Not common. \n  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? \n  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. \n  - It\'s hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.\n\nSo the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.\n\nWe also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S.\n\nSo let me list:\n  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.\n  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.\n  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.\n  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.\n  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven\'t used C or L.\n  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S\'s. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.\n\nSo I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWe have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.\n\nBOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.\n\nFLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.\n\nWe want to cover more consonants. Let\'s choose a word that has letters that are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let\'s try to include T, L, C, etc.\n\nBOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.\nCOAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.\nFLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.\nCLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.\n\nAmong these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.\n\nBut note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That\'s a candidate position.\n\nIn the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.\n\nBut we have to have S at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.\n\nWords ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.\n\nBut common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.\n\nOr CONSA? Not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard. So we stick with A at position 3.\n\nNow, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let\'s choose COAST because C is a common letter.\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.\n\nABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we would be testing B and Y.\n\nBut Y is less common. So maybe not.\n\nAnother word: A C T S ? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nHow about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut note: COAST has O. We haven\'t tested O before. It\'s a vowel and common.\n\nSo I think COAST is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word COAST: \n  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.\n\nWe know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don\'t have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).\n\nBut we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.\n\nSo that\'s good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose COAST.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.\n\nSo the guess is COAST.\n\nNow, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").\n- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).\n- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.\n- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I chose **COAST** because:\n  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).\n  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).\n  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.\n  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.\n\n<guess>COAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

That has two S\'s? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven\'t been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven\'t tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.\n\n- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn\'t have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S\'s. And we know S is at position 4, but we don\'t know if there\'s another S at position 5. Also, we haven\'t tested G or L.\n\nBut is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn\'t have T. But it has two S\'s.\n\nHowever, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn\'t match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _\n\nSo last letter is something after AS.\n\nWords like:\n\n- ALMAS? Not common.\n- BAPUS? Not a word.\n- BASS: but it\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nCommon 5-letter words:\n\n- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`\n\nExamples:\n\n- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.\n\nBut we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?\n\n- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)\n\n- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A\'s? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there\'s an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nBut ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nAnother word: QANAT? Not matching.\n\nAnd SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.\n\nBut wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.\n\nSo SHALL doesn\'t fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nBack to FLASH and GNASH.\n\nBut we also have words like:\n\n- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.\n\nWe have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nWe need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.\n\nBut we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.\n\nFor the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.\n\nForbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.\n\nSo allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H\n- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H\n- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H\n- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H\n- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).\n\nOther options:\n\n- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.\n- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.\n\nAlso, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don\'t know if it\'s allowed or if it\'s the same A.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.\n\nAnother word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.\n\n- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.\n\nWe also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.\n\nSo possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.\n\nWe need to pick one that helps us test the most.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.\n\nWe want to test new letters.\n\nFor example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.\n\nGNASH: tests G, N, H.\n\nPLASH: tests P, L, H.\n\nSLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.\n\nSince we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:\n\n- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.\n- If it has two S\'s, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:\n\nIf the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:\n  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.\n\nStandard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it\'s in the word, it would be present.\n\nBut in our case, we don\'t know if there is an L or not.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.\n\nABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A\'s, so duplicate A.\n\nSo duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.\n\nWords without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nNow, which one? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.\n\nFLASH: F is not very common, L is common.\n\nGNASH: G and N, N common.\n\nPLASH: P is common, L common.\n\nBut note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.\n\nWe don\'t know if H is in the word.\n\nWe can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.\n\nLet me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.\n\nBut another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.\n\nSimilarly, GNASH tests G and N.\n\nAs per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.\n\nBut F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.\n\nSo N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).\n\nFLASH: F (2%), L (4%).\n\nSo GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.\n\nGHASH? Not a word.\n\nWe also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.\n\nNot matching pattern.\n\nAnother: WRASH? Not common.\n\nSo between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nI think FLASH is a familiar word? So I\'ll go with FLASH.\n\nBut PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother option: HALAS? Not pattern.\n\nSo FLASH.\n\nBut FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)\n\nNow, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.\n\nSo we can input FLASH.\n\nWe hope to get feedback on F, L, H.\n\nIf any are in the word, we get - or ✓.\n\nTherefore, I choose FLASH.\n\nBut note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nSo guess: FLASH.\n\nNow, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.\n- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.\n\nDeductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).\n2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.\n3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.\n- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven\'t been used yet.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).\n- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.\n\n<guess>FLASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n1.

But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven\'t ruled it out.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A\'s. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A\'s, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.\n\nBut in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.\n\nBut we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B, and it\'s not in the absent list. So B is allowed.\n\nBut ABASH has A at position 1? We don\'t know if that is correct.\n\nAnother word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.\n\n- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret has two S\'s. Also, M is a new letter.\n\nBut SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.\n\nHowever, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.\n\nOther words:\n\n- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven\'t tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.\n\n- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.\n\n- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.\n\n- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.\n\nBut we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn\'t have L. So it\'s S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are using S at position 1.\n\nNow, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nAnother word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.\n\n- SQUASH? That\'s 6 letters.\n\n- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.\n\nBut we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nWe also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.\n\nAnother: PASH? 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5.\n\nLet me think of more words:\n\n- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn\'t match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.\n\n- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.\n\nSo the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ABASH\n- AWASH\n- GNASH\n- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)\n- SWASH (duplicate S)\n- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.\n- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.\n- CRASH? C and R absent.\n- DRASH? Not common.\n\nSo the candidates from the remaining letters:\n\n- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B\n- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W\n- GNASH: G, N\n- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M\n- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W\n\nWe also have:\n\n- KAPAS? Not matching.\n- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).\n- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.\n\nAnother: GAZSH? Not a word.\n\nSo the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).\n\nWe can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.\n\nBut we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.\n\nFor example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.\n\nSimilarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.\n\nSo if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nIf we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.\n\nBut we don\'t have much information about the first two letters.\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that doesn\'t use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.\n\nSo we have to use A, S, H.\n\nThe only freedom is the first two letters.\n\nWe can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.\n\nIf we guess GNASH and it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nFor example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don\'t know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a \'-\' for G. Similarly for N.\n\nBut we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nSo that would be very informative.\n\nWhereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn\'t have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it\'s not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.\n\nBut we are limited on guesses.\n\nI think GNASH is a good candidate.\n\nWe also have other words like:\n\n- MNASH? Not a word.\n- PNASH? Not.\n\nSo let\'s go with GNASH.\n\nBut GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.\n\nSo I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we guess GNASH.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.\n\nAnd letters: G and N are not in the absent list.\n\nSo we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nBut we hope it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: DASH + something? Not.\n\nI think GNASH is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: RAISE**  \n  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - R, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: COAST**  \n  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - C, O, T are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n\n- **Guess 3: FLASH**  \n  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  \n  Insights:  \n  - F, L are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n  - H is **correct** at position 5.  \n\n### Deductions\n1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  \n   - Position 3: **A**  \n   - Position 4: **S**  \n   - Position 5: **H**  \n   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  \n\n2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  \n   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L (from all feedback).  \n\n3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  \n   - Available letters (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n   - We need a valid 5-letter English word matching `_ _ A S H`.  \n\n4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words):  \n   - **GNASH**: G N A S H (fits pattern, tests new letters G and N).  \n   - **ABASH**: A B A S H (tests duplicate A and B, but A at position 1 is uncertain).  \n   - **AWASH**: A W A S H (tests duplicate A and W).  \n   - **SMASH**: S M A S H (tests duplicate S and M).  \n   - **SWASH**: S W A S H (tests duplicate S and W).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Goal**: Test new letters and avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty.  \n  - **GNASH** is optimal because:  \n    - It uses **G** and **N** (common consonants not tested yet).  \n    - No duplicate letters (unlike ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH), ensuring cleaner feedback.  \n    - If incorrect, feedback on G and N will directly reveal their status (present/absent) and positions, narrowing the possibilities to 1-2 remaining words.  \n- **Why not others?**  \n  - **ABASH/AWASH**: Risk of duplicate A (unknown if secret has two A\'s).  \n  - **SMASH/SWASH**: Risk of duplicate S (S is already fixed at position 4).  \n\nGiven the pattern `_ _ A S H` and absent letters, **GNASH** is a strong guess to maximize information or solve the puzzle.\n\n<guess>GNASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\nGuess 4: GNASH -> FEEDBACK: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for four guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E absent.
   - A present but not at position 2.
   - S correct at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T absent.
   - A correct at position 3.
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F, L absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5.

4. Guess 4: GNASH -> Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - G, N absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5 (confirmed).

From the feedback, we know the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: H
- So the pattern is: _ _ A S H

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The remaining letters (from the alphabet) that haven't been tested or are not absent: 
B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A S H using only the remaining letters and the known letters (A, S, H at fixed positions).

Possible words that fit the pattern and use the available letters:

- We need two letters at the start that form a valid word with ""ASH"" at the end.

Common words ending with ""ASH"":
- ABASH: But A is at position 1? We have A at position 3, so if we use ABASH, it would be A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicate A is allowed. However, we have not been told that A is duplicated, so it might be. Also, B is an available letter.
- AWASH: Similarly, A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate A, and W is available.
- Other possibilities: 
  - BASH: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
  - CASH: 4 letters.
  - DASH: 4 letters.
  - We need 5-letter words.

Other 5-letter words:
- SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate S. S is at position 1 and 4. But we know S is at position 4, so if we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate. M is available.
- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S, and W available.
- Other: 
  - QUASH: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Q and U are available. But Q is not very common.
  - SQUASH is 6 letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So let's list possible words:

1. ABASH: Uses A (duplicate), B. But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not in the absent list.
2. AWASH: Uses A (duplicate), W.
3. SMASH: Uses S (duplicate), M.
4. SWASH: Uses S (duplicate), W.
5. QUASH: Uses Q, U.

We also have:
- PASH: 4 letters? Not 5.
- KAPAS: Not matching pattern (A at position 2?).
- MANAS: Not matching (A at 2 and 4?).
- PAPAS: Not matching.

Another word: UMIAK? Not ending with ASH.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We have 2 guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess out of 6).

We need to choose one. Since we don't know about duplicates, we might have to test.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A, but it could be the only one. Similarly, for S, we have only seen it at position 4.

We can try to avoid duplicates first? But we have limited options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume duplicates, but we don't have any word without duplicates in the candidate list? 

What about words that don't use A or S at the start? But we have to have A at 3 and S at 4, so the only duplicates would be if we put A or S at positions 1 or 2.

But in the candidates, ABASH and AWASH have A at position 1, and SMASH and SWASH have S at position 1.

QUASH has no duplicate, but uses Q and U.

So QUASH is a candidate without duplicates: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). All letters are unique.

And Q and U are available.

But QUASH is a valid word: to quash a rebellion.

So we can consider QUASH.

Now, among ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We want to choose one that might be more common or that tests letters that are more likely.

But we don't have frequency information.

We can choose QUASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters (Q and U).

If we guess QUASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is a rare letter, so it might not be in the word.

Similarly, we can try a word with more common letters? But the remaining letters are not extremely common.

Another candidate: I think we missed one.

What about ""DASHY""? But D A S H Y -> pattern: D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need A at position 3 and S at position 4? Here A is at 2 and S at 3, which doesn't match.

Not.

""BASH"" with a suffix? Not 5 letters.

So the candidates are limited.

We can try SMASH: S M A S H. This tests M and also tests if there is a duplicate S.

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 would be marked absent, and we know S is at position 4.

Similarly, for ABASH, if there is no duplicate A, then the A at position 1 would be marked absent.

But we know the secret word has at least one A at position 3.

So let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

The secret word is ? ? A S H

With the first two letters being from B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Possible words:

- ABASH: A and B
- AWASH: A and W
- SMASH: S and M
- SWASH: S and W
- QUASH: Q and U
- Other rare ones: like UMASH? Not a word.

We also have ""PYXASH""? Not a word.

So I think the common ones are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

Now, to decide:

- If we guess QUASH and it's correct, we win.

- If not, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is rare, so it might be more efficient to guess a word without Q.

We can guess SMASH to test M and duplicate S.

Similarly, we can guess ABASH to test B and duplicate A.

But note: we have two guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we want to solve as soon as possible.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses two new letters and doesn't duplicate A or S, but the only one is QUASH.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates and without Q.

For example, with M and W: but we don't have a word ""MWASH"" or something.

Or B and M: ""BMASH"" not a word.

So QUASH is the only one without duplicates.

Alternatively, we can consider that the secret word might be ""AWASH"" or ""ABASH"" or ""SMASH"", which are more common than ""QUASH"".

""SMASH"" is a very common word.

Similarly, ""ABASH"" means to embarrass, which is less common.

""AWASH"" means covered with water, also less common.

""QUASH"" is a verb, meaning to suppress.

But in terms of frequency, ""SMASH"" might be the most common.

Also, ""SWASH"" is less common (as in swashbuckle).

So perhaps ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that we are using S at position 1, which might be a duplicate.

But if the secret word is ""SMASH"", then we win.

If not, and if the feedback shows that the first S is absent (because the secret has only one S at position 4), then we know there is no duplicate S, and we also get that M is absent? Or if M is present, we get feedback.

But if we guess SMASH:

- If the secret word is SMASH: then we get all correct.

- If the secret word is ABASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S at position 1: since the secret has no S at position 1 (because it has only one S at position 4), so S(1) would be marked absent (x).
  - M at position 2: the secret has B at position 2? In ABASH, position 2 is B, so M is absent? So M(x).
  - A(3): correct (✓)
  - S(4): correct (✓)
  - H(5): correct (✓)
  So feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- Similarly, if the secret is AWASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has A at 1 and S at 4.
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has W at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Same feedback.

- If the secret is SWASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): present? But in SWASH, S is at 1 and 4. So if we guess SMASH, which has S at 1 and 4, then:
    - S at 1: the secret has S at 1, so ✓? But wait, the secret has two S's? So S at 1: correct (✓) because it matches position.
    - M at 2: secret has W at 2, so M is absent (x)
    - A(3): ✓
    - S(4): ✓
    - H(5): ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- If the secret is QUASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has Q at 1 and no duplicate S (only at 4).
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has U at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

So if we guess SMASH, the feedback will tell us:

- If we get all ✓, then it's SMASH.

- If we get S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it must be SWASH (because only SWASH has S at position 1).

- If we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

But we won't be able to distinguish between ABASH, AWASH, and QUASH with that feedback.

We would need another guess.

But we have only one guess left after this.

So if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then we have three possibilities: ABASH, AWASH, QUASH.

And we have one guess left. We can guess one of them, but if we guess wrong, we lose.

So that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that can distinguish between these possibilities.

But we are forced to guess a word that fits the pattern? Because we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5.

So for the fifth guess, we have to guess one of the candidates.

We can guess ABASH, for example.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it's not ABASH, and we can guess AWASH or QUASH in the sixth guess.

But we don't know which one.

Similarly, if we guess AWASH and it's wrong, then we have to choose between ABASH and QUASH.

But we have no information about B, W, Q, U.

So it's risky.

To maximize the chance, we can guess the most common word.

But we don't know which is most common.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses one of the letters from the candidates but not the others.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we can try to guess a word that has B but not W or Q, but we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5, so the only word with B is ABASH.

Similarly, the only word with W is AWASH and SWASH, but SWASH has duplicate S.

And the only word with Q is QUASH.

So we cannot form a word that tests B without committing to ABASH.

Therefore, we have to guess one of the candidates.

Given that, we should guess the most common word.

According to word frequency, ""SMASH"" is more common than the others.

""ABASH"" is less common, ""AWASH"" is even less common, ""QUASH"" is moderately common, ""SWASH"" is less common.

So I think ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

If it's not ""SMASH"", and we get feedback indicating it's not, then we can use the last guess for one of the others.

But as above, if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

Then for the sixth guess, we have to pick one.

We can pick the most common among them, which might be QUASH or ABASH.

But it's a gamble.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests the letters? But we have to have the pattern _ _ A S H, so we cannot change the last three letters.

We are forced to have A, S, H at 3,4,5.

So we cannot introduce a new letter at position 3,4,5.

The only flexibility is positions 1 and 2.

So we have to guess a word with two new letters at 1 and 2.

So we cannot avoid guessing one of the candidates.

Therefore, I will go with SMASH.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback that will help us for the last guess.

So guess: SMASH

Output: <guess>SMASH</guess>

  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H is **correct** at position 5.  

- **Guess 4 (GNASH)**:  
  Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - G, N are **absent**.  
  - A, S, H are **correct** at positions 3, 4, 5 (confirmed).  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
   - Position 3: **A**  
   - Position 4: **S**  
   - Position 5: **H**  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  
   - Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words matching `_ _ A S H`):  
   - **SMASH** (S at position 1, M at position 2)  
   - **SWASH** (S at position 1, W at position 2)  
   - **ABASH** (A at position 1, B at position 2)  
   - **AWASH** (A at position 1, W at position 2)  
   - **QUASH** (Q at position 1, U at position 2)  

### Strategy for Guess 5
- **Goal**: Guess a high-probability candidate to solve the puzzle or narrow options.  
  - **SMASH** is chosen because:  
    - It is a **common English word** (more frequent than other candidates like ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH).  
    - It tests **S at position 1** (possible duplicate S) and **M** (new letter).  
    - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:  
      - If **SMASH is correct**, the game ends.  
      - If **S is marked ✓ at position 1**, the secret must be **SWASH** (only other candidate with S at position 1).  
      - If **S is marked x at position 1**, the secret is one of **ABASH/AWASH/QUASH**, and the last guess can target these.  

<guess>SMASH</guess>",SMASH,"We are given feedback for four guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E absent.
   - A present but not at position 2.
   - S correct at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T absent.
   - A correct at position 3.
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F, L absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5.

4. Guess 4: GNASH -> Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - G, N absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5 (confirmed).

From the feedback, we know the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: H
- So the pattern is: _ _ A S H

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The remaining letters (from the alphabet) that haven't been tested or are not absent: 
B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A S H using only the remaining letters and the known letters (A, S, H at fixed positions).

Possible words that fit the pattern and use the available letters:

- We need two letters at the start that form a valid word with ""ASH"" at the end.

Common words ending with ""ASH"":
- ABASH: But A is at position 1? We have A at position 3, so if we use ABASH, it would be A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicate A is allowed. However, we have not been told that A is duplicated, so it might be. Also, B is an available letter.
- AWASH: Similarly, A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate A, and W is available.
- Other possibilities: 
  - BASH: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
  - CASH: 4 letters.
  - DASH: 4 letters.
  - We need 5-letter words.

Other 5-letter words:
- SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate S. S is at position 1 and 4. But we know S is at position 4, so if we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate. M is available.
- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S, and W available.
- Other: 
  - QUASH: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Q and U are available. But Q is not very common.
  - SQUASH is 6 letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So let's list possible words:

1. ABASH: Uses A (duplicate), B. But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not in the absent list.
2. AWASH: Uses A (duplicate), W.
3. SMASH: Uses S (duplicate), M.
4. SWASH: Uses S (duplicate), W.
5. QUASH: Uses Q, U.

We also have:
- PASH: 4 letters? Not 5.
- KAPAS: Not matching pattern (A at position 2?).
- MANAS: Not matching (A at 2 and 4?).
- PAPAS: Not matching.

Another word: UMIAK? Not ending with ASH.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We have 2 guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess out of 6).

We need to choose one. Since we don't know about duplicates, we might have to test.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A, but it could be the only one. Similarly, for S, we have only seen it at position 4.

We can try to avoid duplicates first? But we have limited options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume duplicates, but we don't have any word without duplicates in the candidate list? 

What about words that don't use A or S at the start? But we have to have A at 3 and S at 4, so the only duplicates would be if we put A or S at positions 1 or 2.

But in the candidates, ABASH and AWASH have A at position 1, and SMASH and SWASH have S at position 1.

QUASH has no duplicate, but uses Q and U.

So QUASH is a candidate without duplicates: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). All letters are unique.

And Q and U are available.

But QUASH is a valid word: to quash a rebellion.

So we can consider QUASH.

Now, among ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We want to choose one that might be more common or that tests letters that are more likely.

But we don't have frequency information.

We can choose QUASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters (Q and U).

If we guess QUASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is a rare letter, so it might not be in the word.

Similarly, we can try a word with more common letters? But the remaining letters are not extremely common.

Another candidate: I think we missed one.

What about ""DASHY""? But D A S H Y -> pattern: D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need A at position 3 and S at position 4? Here A is at 2 and S at 3, which doesn't match.

Not.

""BASH"" with a suffix? Not 5 letters.

So the candidates are limited.

We can try SMASH: S M A S H. This tests M and also tests if there is a duplicate S.

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 would be marked absent, and we know S is at position 4.

Similarly, for ABASH, if there is no duplicate A, then the A at position 1 would be marked absent.

But we know the secret word has at least one A at position 3.

So let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

The secret word is ? ? A S H

With the first two letters being from B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Possible words:

- ABASH: A and B
- AWASH: A and W
- SMASH: S and M
- SWASH: S and W
- QUASH: Q and U
- Other rare ones: like UMASH? Not a word.

We also have ""PYXASH""? Not a word.

So I think the common ones are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

Now, to decide:

- If we guess QUASH and it's correct, we win.

- If not, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is rare, so it might be more efficient to guess a word without Q.

We can guess SMASH to test M and duplicate S.

Similarly, we can guess ABASH to test B and duplicate A.

But note: we have two guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we want to solve as soon as possible.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses two new letters and doesn't duplicate A or S, but the only one is QUASH.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates and without Q.

For example, with M and W: but we don't have a word ""MWASH"" or something.

Or B and M: ""BMASH"" not a word.

So QUASH is the only one without duplicates.

Alternatively, we can consider that the secret word might be ""AWASH"" or ""ABASH"" or ""SMASH"", which are more common than ""QUASH"".

""SMASH"" is a very common word.

Similarly, ""ABASH"" means to embarrass, which is less common.

""AWASH"" means covered with water, also less common.

""QUASH"" is a verb, meaning to suppress.

But in terms of frequency, ""SMASH"" might be the most common.

Also, ""SWASH"" is less common (as in swashbuckle).

So perhaps ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that we are using S at position 1, which might be a duplicate.

But if the secret word is ""SMASH"", then we win.

If not, and if the feedback shows that the first S is absent (because the secret has only one S at position 4), then we know there is no duplicate S, and we also get that M is absent? Or if M is present, we get feedback.

But if we guess SMASH:

- If the secret word is SMASH: then we get all correct.

- If the secret word is ABASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S at position 1: since the secret has no S at position 1 (because it has only one S at position 4), so S(1) would be marked absent (x).
  - M at position 2: the secret has B at position 2? In ABASH, position 2 is B, so M is absent? So M(x).
  - A(3): correct (✓)
  - S(4): correct (✓)
  - H(5): correct (✓)
  So feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- Similarly, if the secret is AWASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has A at 1 and S at 4.
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has W at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Same feedback.

- If the secret is SWASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): present? But in SWASH, S is at 1 and 4. So if we guess SMASH, which has S at 1 and 4, then:
    - S at 1: the secret has S at 1, so ✓? But wait, the secret has two S's? So S at 1: correct (✓) because it matches position.
    - M at 2: secret has W at 2, so M is absent (x)
    - A(3): ✓
    - S(4): ✓
    - H(5): ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- If the secret is QUASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has Q at 1 and no duplicate S (only at 4).
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has U at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

So if we guess SMASH, the feedback will tell us:

- If we get all ✓, then it's SMASH.

- If we get S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it must be SWASH (because only SWASH has S at position 1).

- If we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

But we won't be able to distinguish between ABASH, AWASH, and QUASH with that feedback.

We would need another guess.

But we have only one guess left after this.

So if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then we have three possibilities: ABASH, AWASH, QUASH.

And we have one guess left. We can guess one of them, but if we guess wrong, we lose.

So that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that can distinguish between these possibilities.

But we are forced to guess a word that fits the pattern? Because we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5.

So for the fifth guess, we have to guess one of the candidates.

We can guess ABASH, for example.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it's not ABASH, and we can guess AWASH or QUASH in the sixth guess.

But we don't know which one.

Similarly, if we guess AWASH and it's wrong, then we have to choose between ABASH and QUASH.

But we have no information about B, W, Q, U.

So it's risky.

To maximize the chance, we can guess the most common word.

But we don't know which is most common.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses one of the letters from the candidates but not the others.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we can try to guess a word that has B but not W or Q, but we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5, so the only word with B is ABASH.

Similarly, the only word with W is AWASH and SWASH, but SWASH has duplicate S.

And the only word with Q is QUASH.

So we cannot form a word that tests B without committing to ABASH.

Therefore, we have to guess one of the candidates.

Given that, we should guess the most common word.

According to word frequency, ""SMASH"" is more common than the others.

""ABASH"" is less common, ""AWASH"" is even less common, ""QUASH"" is moderately common, ""SWASH"" is less common.

So I think ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

If it's not ""SMASH"", and we get feedback indicating it's not, then we can use the last guess for one of the others.

But as above, if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

Then for the sixth guess, we have to pick one.

We can pick the most common among them, which might be QUASH or ABASH.

But it's a gamble.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests the letters? But we have to have the pattern _ _ A S H, so we cannot change the last three letters.

We are forced to have A, S, H at 3,4,5.

So we cannot introduce a new letter at position 3,4,5.

The only flexibility is positions 1 and 2.

So we have to guess a word with two new letters at 1 and 2.

So we cannot avoid guessing one of the candidates.

Therefore, I will go with SMASH.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback that will help us for the last guess.

So guess: SMASH

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.
 The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:
   - It contains 'R', 'O', 'A', 'S', 'T' — all common letters.
   - It has two vowels ('O' and 'A') and three consonants.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let's go with ""ROAST"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 But let's stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".

 However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". 

 After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:
   R: present but in wrong position? (because in BRISK, R is at position 2, but in RAISE it's at position 1) -> so R would be marked as '-'
   A: not in BRISK -> 'x'
   I: in BRISK at position 3, and in RAISE at position 3 -> so I would be marked as '✓'
   S: in BRISK at position 4, and in RAISE at position 4 -> '✓'
   E: not in BRISK -> 'x'

 So the feedback would be: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 However, we don't know the secret word. We are just starting.

 Since we are at the first guess, any of these words are acceptable.

 I will go with ""RAISE"".

 But note: the problem says to return the guess in the format: <guess>RAISE</guess>

 However, the instructions say: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>"".

 So we will output: <guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I chose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test frequently used letters. This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not in the word
  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not in the word
  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it's the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")
  E: x -> not in the word

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let's clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.

  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.

  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).
  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's taken by S).
  - Does not contain R, I, or E.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

We know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.

For example:
  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ 
  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.

Common words:
  - CLASS: but that has two S's? And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S's, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don't specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.

So, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.

But for the second guess, we want to maximize information.

We know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don't know about other letters.

We can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.

Possible words:
  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S's and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.
  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.
  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that's not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.

We need to avoid R, I, E.

So let's try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.

Also, we want to test new letters.

Let me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).

Actually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].

We need to fill in the blanks.

Constraints:
  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was 'x', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).
  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that's S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don't know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.
  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). 
  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - How about AULOS? Not common. 
  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn't work.

We must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]

So for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]
  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Possible words:
  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S's and Y, and it's 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let's check: 
      A: present and at position 1 -> we don't know if that's correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. 
  - But ABYSS has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.

Another candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. 
  - ADOBS? Not a word.
  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.

Another idea: A N K H S? Not a word.

This is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]
  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.

Examples:
  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.

BOAST: 
  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).

Another candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.

Or D O A S T? Not common.

Or F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.

Or SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don't know if the secret word has two S's. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S's. We don't know if that's allowed. But we can try.

However, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.

But we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S's, but if it doesn't, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.

But for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.

So let's consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.

Now, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A
  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. 
  - M A N S A? Not common. 
  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? 
  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. 
  - It's hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.

So the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.

We also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Another candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

So let me list:
  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.
  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.
  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.
  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.
  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven't used C or L.
  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S's. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.

But note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.

So I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

We have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.

BOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.

FLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.

We want to cover more consonants. Let's choose a word that has letters that are more common.

Common consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let's try to include T, L, C, etc.

BOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.
COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.
FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.
CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.

Among these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.

But note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That's a candidate position.

In the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.

But we have to have S at position 4.

Another idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.

Words ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.

But common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.

Or CONSA? Not a word.

So it's hard. So we stick with A at position 3.

Now, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let's choose COAST because C is a common letter.

But we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.

ABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. Also, we would be testing B and Y.

But Y is less common. So maybe not.

Another word: A C T S ? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

How about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).

So let's go with COAST.

But note: COAST has O. We haven't tested O before. It's a vowel and common.

So I think COAST is a good choice.

But let me confirm: the word COAST: 
  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.

We know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.

If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don't have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).

But we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.

So let's go with COAST.

But wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a '-' for A (meaning it's in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.

So that's good information.

Therefore, I choose COAST.

But note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.

So the guess is COAST.

Now, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").
- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").

Key deductions:
- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).
- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.
- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).

For the second guess:
- I chose **COAST** because:
  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).
  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.
  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.

<guess>COAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - This told us:
     - R, I, E are not in the word.
     - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (since it was marked correct in position 4).

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - Interpretation:
     - C, O, T are not in the word (x).
     - A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3 and marked correct).
     - S is in the word and at position 4 (same as before).

From both guesses, we now know:

- The secret word contains letters: A (at position 3), S (at position 4).
- The secret word does NOT contain: R, I, E, C, O, T.

Additionally, from the first guess, we knew A was not at position 2, and now we know it is at position 3.

We also know that the word has 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We know:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S

So the secret word has the form: _ _ A S _

Now, we need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that are not forbidden and are in the word.

Forbidden letters (so far): R, I, E, C, O, T.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We need to find possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We haven't tested many letters yet. We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, T.

So letters from the first two guesses: A, C, E, I, O, R, S, T.

We know A and S are in the word (fixed positions), and the others are out.

Now, we must use new letters for positions 1, 2, and 5.

We want to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ A S _ and uses letters not in the forbidden set.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form __AS_.

Let me think of words ending with ""AS"": actually, our word has ""AS"" at positions 3-4, so it must be followed by a letter at position 5.

Pattern: __A S _

Some possibilities:

- First two letters: we have to fill with two letters, and then the last letter.

Common words:

- CLASS? That has two S's? Pattern: C L A S S -> positions: C(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). But we don't know if the word allows duplicates. However, we haven't been told if duplicates are possible. Also, we haven't tested L yet. But CLASS has C? We already know C is not in the word. So CLASS is invalid because it has C.

- GLASS: G L A S S -> same, has S at the end? But G, L are new. But C in CLASS is forbidden? GLASS doesn't have C. But wait: GLASS -> G(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), S(5). So two S's. And we know S is at position 4, but we don't know if there's another S at position 5. Also, we haven't tested G or L.

But is GLASS valid? Yes, but it has duplicate S. Also, in feedback: for the second guess COAST, we had T marked absent, and T is in CLASS? No, GLASS doesn't have T. But it has two S's.

However, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn't match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.

We need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _

So last letter is something after AS.

Words like:

- ALMAS? Not common.
- BAPUS? Not a word.
- BASS: but it's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

Common 5-letter words:

- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`

Examples:

- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.

But we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?

- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)

- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A's? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there's an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A's? It's possible.

But ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QANAT? Not matching.

And SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.

But wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.

So SHALL doesn't fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.

So not.

Another one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.

Not matching.

Back to FLASH and GNASH.

But we also have words like:

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.

But we don't know.

Another: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.

Now, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.

We have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.

We need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.

In the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.

But we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.

For the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried and fits the pattern.

Let's list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.

Forbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.

So allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.

Possible words:

- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H
- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H
- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H
- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H
- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).

Other options:

- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.
- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.

Also, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don't know if it's allowed or if it's the same A.

But it's a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.

Another word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.

- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn't fit.

Another: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.

We also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.

So possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.

We need to pick one that helps us test the most.

But note: we don't know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it's not necessary.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.

We want to test new letters.

For example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.

GNASH: tests G, N, H.

PLASH: tests P, L, H.

SLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.

Since we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:

- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.
- If it has two S's, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:

If the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:
  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.

Standard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it's in the word, it would be present.

But in our case, we don't know if there is an L or not.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.

So let's delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.

ABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A's, so duplicate A.

So duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.

Words without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

We can choose any.

Now, which one? We want to test common letters.

Common consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.

FLASH: F is not very common, L is common.

GNASH: G and N, N common.

PLASH: P is common, L common.

But note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.

We don't know if H is in the word.

We can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.

Let me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.

But another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.

Similarly, GNASH tests G and N.

As per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.

But F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.

So N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).

FLASH: F (2%), L (4%).

So GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.

GHASH? Not a word.

We also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.

Not matching pattern.

Another: WRASH? Not common.

So between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.

I think FLASH is a familiar word? So I'll go with FLASH.

But PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it's acceptable.

Another option: HALAS? Not pattern.

So FLASH.

But FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)

Now, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.

So we can input FLASH.

We hope to get feedback on F, L, H.

If any are in the word, we get - or ✓.

Therefore, I choose FLASH.

But note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.

So guess: FLASH.

Now, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.

Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).
2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.
3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).

For the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.
- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven't been used yet.
- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).
- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.

   - A is present but not at position 2.
   - S is present and at position 4.

   - F and L are absent.
   - A is at position 3 (correct, so we already knew that).

   - H is present and at position 5 (so now we know the fifth letter is H).

From the feedback of the third guess, we have:
- H is in the word and at position 5.

So now we know the secret word is: _ _ A S H

We know the positions:
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: H

We need to find the first two letters.

We also know the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

So the absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L.

We must choose two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining letters that are not in the absent set.

The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have used the following letters in guesses (and know their status):

- A: present (at position 3)
- S: present (at position 4)
- H: present (at position 5)
- R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L: absent.

So the remaining letters (not used and not absent) are: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2] A S H

We need to find a valid English word that matches this pattern and uses letters from the remaining set.

Let's list possible words:

- BASH: B A S H -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The pattern is _ _ A S H, so two letters before ""A"", so it must be 5 letters.

So words ending with ""ASH"": but we have two letters before A.

Examples:

- DASH: D A S H -> again, 4 letters? No, DASH is 4 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words ending with ""ASH"" are not common? Actually, we have:

- ABASH: A B A S H -> but we have A at position 1? And A at position 3? But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don't know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven't ruled it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A's. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A's, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.

But in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.

But we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven't tested B, and it's not in the absent list. So B is allowed.

But ABASH has A at position 1? We don't know if that is correct.

Another word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.

- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S's. But we don't know if the secret has two S's. Also, M is a new letter.

But SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.

But we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.

However, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.

But let's list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.

Other words:

- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven't tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.

- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.

- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.

- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.

But we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn't have L. So it's S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that's fine.

But we are using S at position 1.

Now, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

Another word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.

- SQUASH? That's 6 letters.

- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.

But we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.

But we don't know if A is duplicated.

We also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.

Another: PASH? 4 letters.

We need 5.

Let me think of more words:

- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn't match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.

- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.

So the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H

Common words:

- ABASH
- AWASH
- GNASH
- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)
- SWASH (duplicate S)
- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.
- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.
- CRASH? C and R absent.
- DRASH? Not common.

So the candidates from the remaining letters:

- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B
- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W
- GNASH: G, N
- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M
- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W

We also have:

- KAPAS? Not matching.
- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).
- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.

Another: GAZSH? Not a word.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.

We need to choose one to guess.

We have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).

We can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.

But let's see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.

But we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.

For example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.

Similarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.

So if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.

If we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.

But we don't have much information about the first two letters.

We can also consider the frequency of letters.

Common letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.

But we don't have much to go on.

Another idea: we can use a word that doesn't use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.

So we have to use A, S, H.

The only freedom is the first two letters.

We can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.

If we guess GNASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

For example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don't know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a '-' for G. Similarly for N.

But we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.

Similarly for N.

So that would be very informative.

Whereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn't have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it's not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.

But we are limited on guesses.

I think GNASH is a good candidate.

We also have other words like:

- MNASH? Not a word.
- PNASH? Not.

So let's go with GNASH.

But GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.

So I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, we guess GNASH.

But let's confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.

And letters: G and N are not in the absent list.

So we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>

If it's not correct, we get feedback on G and N.

But we hope it is correct.

Alternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.

Another word: DASH + something? Not.

I think GNASH is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  
  Insights:  
  - R, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4.  

- **Guess 2: COAST**  
  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - C, O, T are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  

- **Guess 3: FLASH**  
  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - F, L are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H is **correct** at position 5.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
   - Position 3: **A**  
   - Position 4: **S**  
   - Position 5: **H**  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L (from all feedback).  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  
   - Available letters (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - We need a valid 5-letter English word matching `_ _ A S H`.  

4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words):  
   - **GNASH**: G N A S H (fits pattern, tests new letters G and N).  
   - **ABASH**: A B A S H (tests duplicate A and B, but A at position 1 is uncertain).  
   - **AWASH**: A W A S H (tests duplicate A and W).  
   - **SMASH**: S M A S H (tests duplicate S and M).  
   - **SWASH**: S W A S H (tests duplicate S and W).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Test new letters and avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty.  
  - **GNASH** is optimal because:  
    - It uses **G** and **N** (common consonants not tested yet).  
    - No duplicate letters (unlike ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH), ensuring cleaner feedback.  
    - If incorrect, feedback on G and N will directly reveal their status (present/absent) and positions, narrowing the possibilities to 1-2 remaining words.  
- **Why not others?**  
  - **ABASH/AWASH**: Risk of duplicate A (unknown if secret has two A's).  
  - **SMASH/SWASH**: Risk of duplicate S (S is already fixed at position 4).  

Given the pattern `_ _ A S H` and absent letters, **GNASH** is a strong guess to maximize information or solve the puzzle.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for four guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - R, I, E absent.
   - A present but not at position 2.
   - S correct at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST -> Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   - C, O, T absent.
   - A correct at position 3.
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).

3. Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - F, L absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5.

4. Guess 4: GNASH -> Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   - G, N absent.
   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).
   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).
   - H correct at position 5 (confirmed).

From the feedback, we know the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: H
- So the pattern is: _ _ A S H

We also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.

The remaining letters (from the alphabet) that haven't been tested or are not absent: 
B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A S H using only the remaining letters and the known letters (A, S, H at fixed positions).

Possible words that fit the pattern and use the available letters:

- We need two letters at the start that form a valid word with ""ASH"" at the end.

Common words ending with ""ASH"":
- ABASH: But A is at position 1? We have A at position 3, so if we use ABASH, it would be A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate A. But we don't know if duplicate A is allowed. However, we have not been told that A is duplicated, so it might be. Also, B is an available letter.
- AWASH: Similarly, A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate A, and W is available.
- Other possibilities: 
  - BASH: but that's 4 letters? We need 5. So not.
  - CASH: 4 letters.
  - DASH: 4 letters.
  - We need 5-letter words.

Other 5-letter words:
- SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate S. S is at position 1 and 4. But we know S is at position 4, so if we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate. M is available.
- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S, and W available.
- Other: 
  - QUASH: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Q and U are available. But Q is not very common.
  - SQUASH is 6 letters.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So let's list possible words:

1. ABASH: Uses A (duplicate), B. But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not in the absent list.
2. AWASH: Uses A (duplicate), W.
3. SMASH: Uses S (duplicate), M.
4. SWASH: Uses S (duplicate), W.
5. QUASH: Uses Q, U.

We also have:
- PASH: 4 letters? Not 5.
- KAPAS: Not matching pattern (A at position 2?).
- MANAS: Not matching (A at 2 and 4?).
- PAPAS: Not matching.

Another word: UMIAK? Not ending with ASH.

So the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We have 2 guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess out of 6).

We need to choose one. Since we don't know about duplicates, we might have to test.

But note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A, but it could be the only one. Similarly, for S, we have only seen it at position 4.

We can try to avoid duplicates first? But we have limited options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't assume duplicates, but we don't have any word without duplicates in the candidate list? 

What about words that don't use A or S at the start? But we have to have A at 3 and S at 4, so the only duplicates would be if we put A or S at positions 1 or 2.

But in the candidates, ABASH and AWASH have A at position 1, and SMASH and SWASH have S at position 1.

QUASH has no duplicate, but uses Q and U.

So QUASH is a candidate without duplicates: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). All letters are unique.

And Q and U are available.

But QUASH is a valid word: to quash a rebellion.

So we can consider QUASH.

Now, among ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

We want to choose one that might be more common or that tests letters that are more likely.

But we don't have frequency information.

We can choose QUASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters (Q and U).

If we guess QUASH and it's not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is a rare letter, so it might not be in the word.

Similarly, we can try a word with more common letters? But the remaining letters are not extremely common.

Another candidate: I think we missed one.

What about ""DASHY""? But D A S H Y -> pattern: D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need A at position 3 and S at position 4? Here A is at 2 and S at 3, which doesn't match.

Not.

""BASH"" with a suffix? Not 5 letters.

So the candidates are limited.

We can try SMASH: S M A S H. This tests M and also tests if there is a duplicate S.

But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 would be marked absent, and we know S is at position 4.

Similarly, for ABASH, if there is no duplicate A, then the A at position 1 would be marked absent.

But we know the secret word has at least one A at position 3.

So let's list the possibilities for the secret word:

The secret word is ? ? A S H

With the first two letters being from B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Possible words:

- ABASH: A and B
- AWASH: A and W
- SMASH: S and M
- SWASH: S and W
- QUASH: Q and U
- Other rare ones: like UMASH? Not a word.

We also have ""PYXASH""? Not a word.

So I think the common ones are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.

Now, to decide:

- If we guess QUASH and it's correct, we win.

- If not, we get feedback on Q and U.

But Q is rare, so it might be more efficient to guess a word without Q.

We can guess SMASH to test M and duplicate S.

Similarly, we can guess ABASH to test B and duplicate A.

But note: we have two guesses left, so we can afford to test.

But we want to solve as soon as possible.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses two new letters and doesn't duplicate A or S, but the only one is QUASH.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates and without Q.

For example, with M and W: but we don't have a word ""MWASH"" or something.

Or B and M: ""BMASH"" not a word.

So QUASH is the only one without duplicates.

Alternatively, we can consider that the secret word might be ""AWASH"" or ""ABASH"" or ""SMASH"", which are more common than ""QUASH"".

""SMASH"" is a very common word.

Similarly, ""ABASH"" means to embarrass, which is less common.

""AWASH"" means covered with water, also less common.

""QUASH"" is a verb, meaning to suppress.

But in terms of frequency, ""SMASH"" might be the most common.

Also, ""SWASH"" is less common (as in swashbuckle).

So perhaps ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that we are using S at position 1, which might be a duplicate.

But if the secret word is ""SMASH"", then we win.

If not, and if the feedback shows that the first S is absent (because the secret has only one S at position 4), then we know there is no duplicate S, and we also get that M is absent? Or if M is present, we get feedback.

But if we guess SMASH:

- If the secret word is SMASH: then we get all correct.

- If the secret word is ABASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S at position 1: since the secret has no S at position 1 (because it has only one S at position 4), so S(1) would be marked absent (x).
  - M at position 2: the secret has B at position 2? In ABASH, position 2 is B, so M is absent? So M(x).
  - A(3): correct (✓)
  - S(4): correct (✓)
  - H(5): correct (✓)
  So feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- Similarly, if the secret is AWASH: then for SMASH: 
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has A at 1 and S at 4.
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has W at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Same feedback.

- If the secret is SWASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): present? But in SWASH, S is at 1 and 4. So if we guess SMASH, which has S at 1 and 4, then:
    - S at 1: the secret has S at 1, so ✓? But wait, the secret has two S's? So S at 1: correct (✓) because it matches position.
    - M at 2: secret has W at 2, so M is absent (x)
    - A(3): ✓
    - S(4): ✓
    - H(5): ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

- If the secret is QUASH: then for SMASH:
  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has Q at 1 and no duplicate S (only at 4).
  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has U at 2.
  - A(3): ✓
  - S(4): ✓
  - H(5): ✓
  Feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

So if we guess SMASH, the feedback will tell us:

- If we get all ✓, then it's SMASH.

- If we get S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it must be SWASH (because only SWASH has S at position 1).

- If we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

But we won't be able to distinguish between ABASH, AWASH, and QUASH with that feedback.

We would need another guess.

But we have only one guess left after this.

So if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then we have three possibilities: ABASH, AWASH, QUASH.

And we have one guess left. We can guess one of them, but if we guess wrong, we lose.

So that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that can distinguish between these possibilities.

But we are forced to guess a word that fits the pattern? Because we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5.

So for the fifth guess, we have to guess one of the candidates.

We can guess ABASH, for example.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it's not ABASH, and we can guess AWASH or QUASH in the sixth guess.

But we don't know which one.

Similarly, if we guess AWASH and it's wrong, then we have to choose between ABASH and QUASH.

But we have no information about B, W, Q, U.

So it's risky.

To maximize the chance, we can guess the most common word.

But we don't know which is most common.

Another idea: we can guess a word that uses one of the letters from the candidates but not the others.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, we can try to guess a word that has B but not W or Q, but we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5, so the only word with B is ABASH.

Similarly, the only word with W is AWASH and SWASH, but SWASH has duplicate S.

And the only word with Q is QUASH.

So we cannot form a word that tests B without committing to ABASH.

Therefore, we have to guess one of the candidates.

Given that, we should guess the most common word.

According to word frequency, ""SMASH"" is more common than the others.

""ABASH"" is less common, ""AWASH"" is even less common, ""QUASH"" is moderately common, ""SWASH"" is less common.

So I think ""SMASH"" is a good guess.

If it's not ""SMASH"", and we get feedback indicating it's not, then we can use the last guess for one of the others.

But as above, if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.

Then for the sixth guess, we have to pick one.

We can pick the most common among them, which might be QUASH or ABASH.

But it's a gamble.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests the letters? But we have to have the pattern _ _ A S H, so we cannot change the last three letters.

We are forced to have A, S, H at 3,4,5.

So we cannot introduce a new letter at position 3,4,5.

The only flexibility is positions 1 and 2.

So we have to guess a word with two new letters at 1 and 2.

So we cannot avoid guessing one of the candidates.

Therefore, I will go with SMASH.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback that will help us for the last guess.

So guess: SMASH

  Insights:  
  - F, L are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H is **correct** at position 5.

  Insights:  
  - G, N are **absent**.  
  - A, S, H are **correct** at positions 3, 4, 5 (confirmed).  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  
   - Position 3: **A**  
   - Position 4: **S**  
   - Position 5: **H**  
   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.  

3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  
   - Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words matching `_ _ A S H`):  
   - **SMASH** (S at position 1, M at position 2)  
   - **SWASH** (S at position 1, W at position 2)  
   - **ABASH** (A at position 1, B at position 2)  
   - **AWASH** (A at position 1, W at position 2)  
   - **QUASH** (Q at position 1, U at position 2)  

### Strategy for Guess 5
- **Goal**: Guess a high-probability candidate to solve the puzzle or narrow options.  
  - **SMASH** is chosen because:  
    - It is a **common English word** (more frequent than other candidates like ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH).  
    - It tests **S at position 1** (possible duplicate S) and **M** (new letter).  
    - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:  
      - If **SMASH is correct**, the game ends.  
      - If **S is marked ✓ at position 1**, the secret must be **SWASH** (only other candidate with S at position 1).  
      - If **S is marked x at position 1**, the secret is one of **ABASH/AWASH/QUASH**, and the last guess can target these.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has common letters: we want at least two vowels and some frequent consonants.\n The word ""ROAST"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It contains \'R\', \'O\', \'A\', \'S\', \'T\' — all common letters.\n   - It has two vowels (\'O\' and \'A\') and three consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But let\'s go with ""ROAST"".\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.\n\n Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n But let\'s stick with a balanced word: ""ROAST"".\n\n However, to maximize the information, we might also consider ""CRATE"" or ""SLANT"". \n\n After some thought, I recall that ""RAISE"" is often recommended because it has three vowels and common consonants.\n\n Let me choose ""RAISE"" for the first guess.\n\n But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", and if we guess ""RAISE"", we would get:\n   R: present but in wrong position?

This increases the chances of getting useful feedback on letter presence and positions early in the game.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":\n  R: x -> not in the word\n  A: - -> in the word but in the wrong position\n  I: x -> not in the word\n  S: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it\'s the 4th letter in ""RAISE"")\n  E: x -> not in the word\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n  - The letter S is in the secret word and is at position 4 (the last letter of a 5-letter word is position 5? Let\'s clarify: in ""RAISE"", the positions are: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. So S is at position 4. But note: the secret word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. The feedback says S is correct at position 4, meaning the secret word has S as its 4th letter.\n\n  - The letter A is in the word but not at position 2. Since we know S is at position 4, A must be at one of the positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? But wait, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. However, we also know that R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n  - Therefore, the secret word contains A and S, and S is at position 4.\n\n  - Also, the word does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n  - Has S at position 4 (because the feedback for S was ✓ and we must keep it there to get more information or to solve).\n  - Contains the letter A, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that\'s taken by S).\n  - Does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: we have used R, A, I, S, E. So we can try letters like T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.\n\nWe know the word must have A (somewhere except position 2 and 4) and S at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have S at position 4 and include A, and avoid R, I, E.\n\nFor example:\n  - The word could be _ _ _ S _ \n  - We need to put A in one of the first three positions or the last.\n\nCommon words:\n  - CLASS: but that has two S\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, CLASS has S at position 4? C L A S S -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. So S is at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. However, our feedback for the first guess only showed one S (and it was at position 4). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we have multiple of the same letter. In the first guess, we only had one S, so if the word has two S\'s, we would have only gotten one S as correct? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter appears multiple times, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? But the rules don\'t specify. Actually, the standard Wordle rules: each letter in the guess is evaluated independently, but if the secret has two of a letter, and the guess has one, then the one might be marked as correct or present, and if the guess has two, then the second one might be marked as absent if the secret only has one. But in our case, we only have one S in the guess, and it was marked correct. So the secret has at least one S at position 4. It might have more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have more information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with duplicate letters for now? Or we can try to test for duplicates.\n\nBut for the second guess, we want to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word has A and S (with S at position 4). We don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words that have S at position 4 and A in the word (but not at position 2) and without R, I, E.\n\nPossible words:\n  - With A at position 1: ASKEW, ASSET (but has two S\'s and E? E is not allowed), ALOES (has E) -> not allowed because of E.\n  - With A at position 3: we have words like BEANS (B E A N S) -> but E is not allowed. Similarly, MEANS, WEANS, etc. have E.\n  - With A at position 5: words like _ _ _ S A. For example: MANSA (but that\'s not common), or VISTA (V I S T A -> but I is not allowed), or FUSTA (not common), or something else.\n\nWe need to avoid R, I, E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have S at position 4, and A at position 1, 3, or 5, and use only letters that are not R, I, E.\n\nAlso, we want to test new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that end with S? But our S is at position 4, so the word is ...S. (so the fifth letter is something else).\n\nActually, the word is [letter1][letter2][letter3]S[letter5].\n\nWe need to fill in the blanks.\n\nConstraints:\n  - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5: cannot be R, I, E (because we know they are not in the word? Actually, the feedback for R, I, E was \'x\', meaning they are not in the word at all. So we must avoid these letters entirely).\n  - The word must contain A, but A cannot be at position 2 (and also not at position 4 because that\'s S). So A must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1 -> A _ _ S _\n  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 3, and one for position 5, all not R, I, E, and not A (unless duplicate allowed, but we don\'t know) and not S (unless duplicate) but we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we can have duplicates, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicates. So we can try without duplicates first.\n  - Possible: A B _ S _ -> but what words? ABYSM? But that has Y and M. Or ACHES? But H and E (E not allowed). \n  - Without E: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - How about AULOS? Not common. \n  - Maybe ATOMS? A T O M S -> positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4) -> wait, but we need S at position 4, so the fourth letter must be S. In ATOMS, the fourth letter is M and fifth is S. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have S at position 4. So the word is: [1][2][3]S[5]\n\nSo for A at position 1: A[2][3]S[5]\n  - We need to fill [2] and [3] and [5] with letters that are not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n  - A B Y S S -> but that has two S\'s and Y, and it\'s 5 letters? ABYSS: A B Y S S -> but then the fourth letter is S and fifth is S. So that would be: position 4: S (correct) and position 5: S. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we have A at position 1. But the word ABYSS has A at 1, which is allowed. However, we have to avoid R, I, E: ABYSS has none of these. So ABYSS is a candidate? But let\'s check: \n      A: present and at position 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s correct or not, but we know A is in the word so it might be at 1 or elsewhere? Actually, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is allowed. \n  - But ABYSS has two S\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we are trying to test new letters. ABYSS uses A, B, Y, S. We already know A and S, so we are testing B and Y.\n\nAnother candidate: ALOHS? Not a word. \n  - ADOBS? Not a word.\n  - How about ATOMS? But in ATOMS, the S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must be ...S as the fourth letter.\n\nAnother idea: A N K H S? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me try A at position 3: then the word is [1][2]A S [5]\n  - We need to fill [1], [2], [5] with letters not R, I, E, and the word must be valid.\n\nExamples:\n  - B O A S T -> B O A S T: positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T -> this has S at 4, A at 3. And no R, I, E. So BOAST is a candidate.\n\nBOAST: \n  - We would test B, O, T (new letters) and confirm A and S (with A at position 3 and S at 4).\n\nAnother candidate: C O A S T -> C O A S T: same as above, but with C. Also valid.\n\nOr D O A S T? Not common.\n\nOr F L A S H -> F L A S H: but the fourth letter is S? F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes, and no R, I, E. So FLASH is a candidate.\n\nOr SLASH? But S at position 1? We have to avoid S at position 1? No, we can have S at position 1? But we already know S is at position 4, so if we put S at position 1, that would be a duplicate. And we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But in SLASH: S at 1 and 4? Actually, SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So two S\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But we can try.\n\nHowever, we are avoiding R, I, E: SLASH has none.\n\nBut we already know S is in the word at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are using S at position 1 as well. That might be okay if the secret word has two S\'s, but if it doesn\'t, then the S at position 1 would be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback would mark the first S as absent (if the secret has only one S at position 4) and the second S (at position 4) as correct. But that would give us information about duplicate.\n\nBut for now, we want to maximize new letters. So maybe avoid duplicates to get cleaner feedback.\n\nSo let\'s consider BOAST, COAST, FLASH, etc.\n\nNow, what about A at position 5? Then the word is [1][2][3]S A\n  - Examples: C A S S A? Not a word and duplicate S. \n  - M A N S A? Not common. \n  - V I S A? But V I S A has I (not allowed) and is 4 letters? \n  - T A S S A? Not common and duplicate. \n  - It\'s hard to find common words ending with ""SA"" without using forbidden letters.\n\nSo the best candidates are with A at position 3: like BOAST, COAST, FLASH.\n\nWe also have words like GOATS (G O A T S) -> but S is at position 5, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nAnother candidate: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5. Not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S.\n\nSo let me list:\n  - BOAST: B, O, A, S, T -> A at 3, S at 4. Avoids R, I, E.\n  - COAST: C, O, A, S, T -> same.\n  - DOATS: D O A T S -> but S at 5? No, DOATS is D O A T S -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:A, 4:T, 5:S -> so S at 5, not 4. So not.\n  - FLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> A at 3, S at 4.\n  - CLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> same, but we haven\'t used C or L.\n  - SLASH: S, L, A, S, H -> but has two S\'s. We already know one S is at position 4, so if we use SLASH, we are testing if there is an S at position 1 as well.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use duplicate letters, but it might complicate the feedback. Since we are on the second guess, we can avoid duplicates to get clear feedback.\n\nSo I think BOAST, COAST, FLASH, CLASH are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWe have not used: B, C, F, L, O, T, H, etc.\n\nBOAST and COAST are very similar. They share O, A, S, T. The only difference is B vs C.\n\nFLASH and CLASH are similar: they share L, A, S, H, and differ by F vs C.\n\nWe want to cover more consonants. Let\'s choose a word that has letters that are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, S, L, C, etc. We already have S. So let\'s try to include T, L, C, etc.\n\nBOAST: letters B, O, A, S, T -> we know A and S, so new: B, O, T.\nCOAST: C, O, A, S, T -> new: C, O, T.\nFLASH: F, L, A, S, H -> new: F, L, H.\nCLASH: C, L, A, S, H -> new: C, L, H.\n\nAmong these, O and T are very common. So BOAST or COAST might be better.\n\nBut note: we also want to check the position of A. We know A is in the word but not at position 2. In BOAST and COAST, A is at position 3. That\'s a candidate position.\n\nIn the first guess, A was at position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position. So now we are putting it at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then we know A is at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t have a candidate for A at position 1 or 5 easily.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at a different position to test.\n\nBut we have to have S at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: what about A at position 5? We had trouble, but let me try again.\n\nWords ending with A: but we have S at position 4, so the word ends with [letter] after S. So the fifth letter is not A? Unless we have ...SA. So the word ends with SA.\n\nBut common words ending with SA: not many. There is MANSA? Not common. Or VISTA? But VISTA has I and we cannot use I.\n\nOr CONSA? Not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard. So we stick with A at position 3.\n\nNow, between BOAST and COAST, which one? They are both good. Let\'s choose COAST because C is a common letter.\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get more information if we use a word without O? Or with O.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 1? We found ABYSS earlier.\n\nABYSS: A at 1, S at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. Also, we would be testing B and Y.\n\nBut Y is less common. So maybe not.\n\nAnother word: A C T S ? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nHow about A D Z E S? But has E and Z (and E is not allowed).\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut note: COAST has O. We haven\'t tested O before. It\'s a vowel and common.\n\nSo I think COAST is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: the word COAST: \n  - C at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5.\n\nWe know A is in the word and not at position 2, so if we put A at 3, that might be correct. And S is at 4 (correct). We are testing C, O, T.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 3, then we get A as correct. If not, then we know A must be at position 1 or 5 (but we don\'t have a candidate for 5, so we might have to adjust next time).\n\nBut we are also testing O at position 2: if the secret word has O, then we get feedback on O.\n\nSo let\'s go with COAST.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has A, but not at 2. Now we are putting A at position 3. If the secret word has A at position 3, then we get a ✓. If not, then we get a \'-\' for A (meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3) and then we know A must be at 1 or 5.\n\nSo that\'s good information.\n\nTherefore, I choose COAST.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R, I, E. COAST has none of these.\n\nSo the guess is COAST.\n\nNow, we output: <guess>COAST</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked with ""-"").\n- S is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (marked with ""✓"").\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word contains **A** and **S** (with **S** fixed at position 4).\n- The word does **not** contain R, I, or E.\n- A must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid and position 4 is occupied by S).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- I chose **COAST** because:\n  - It retains **S** at position 4 (as required by the feedback).\n  - It places **A** at position 3 (testing a new position for A).\n  - It introduces new common letters (**C**, **O**, **T**) to gather more information.\n  - It avoids invalid letters (R, I, E).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and test three new letters (C, O, T) efficiently.\n\n<guess>COAST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1.

But it has two S\'s.\n\nHowever, we are allowed words with duplicates, so it\'s possible.\n\nAnother word: PLAYS? P L A Y S -> but S is at position 5? Then position 4 is Y? But we need position 4 to be S, so that doesn\'t match. In PLAYS: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4), S(5). But we require position 4 to be S, so this is not valid.\n\nWe need position 4 to be S, so the pattern is: __A S _\n\nSo last letter is something after AS.\n\nWords like:\n\n- ALMAS? Not common.\n- BAPUS? Not a word.\n- BASS: but it\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\nCommon 5-letter words:\n\n- We can search: words matching pattern: `__AS_`\n\nExamples:\n\n- FLASH: F L A S H -> matches? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Yes! And letters: F, L, H are not forbidden? Forbidden so far: R,I,E,C,O,T. F, L, H are allowed.\n\nBut we already considered FLASH earlier. And it avoids forbidden letters?\n\n- GNASH: G N A S H -> also: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5)\n\n- ABASH: A B A S H -> has two A\'s? Position: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). We know A is at position 3, but if there\'s an A at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we guessed A only once in COAST and it was correct at position 3. But the secret might have more A\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nBut ABASH: letters A, B, H. And A at position 1 and 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nAnother word: QANAT? Not matching.\n\nAnd SHALL? S H A L L -> but then position 1 is S? And we have S at position 4. And duplicate L.\n\nBut wait: pattern must be __A S _, so first two letters, then A (pos3), S (pos4), and one more.\n\nSo SHALL doesn\'t fit because it would be: S H A L L -> so the fourth letter is L? Not S? But we require position 4 to be S.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother one: ULNAS? U L N A S -> but then A is at position 4? We require A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\nBack to FLASH and GNASH.\n\nBut we also have words like:\n\n- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S at position 1? That would be a duplicate S if the secret has only one S? Or if it has two.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother: PLASH? P L A S H -> same structure.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that will help us narrow down the possible letters.\n\nWe have positions to fill: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nWe need to test new letters to see if they are in the word.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ A S _, we can choose many possibilities.\n\nBut we have tried COAST, and now we know A and S positions.\n\nFor the third guess, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried and fits the pattern.\n\nLet\'s list possible words without forbidden letters and with the pattern __A S _.\n\nForbidden: R,I,E,C,O,T.\n\nSo allowed consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z, and vowels: only U (since A is already placed). But we can have vowels at other positions? Position 1, 2, or 5 could have vowels? But we have tested O (forbidden) and E,I (forbidden). So vowels left: U, and sometimes Y.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- FLASH: F(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> letters F,L,H\n- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G,N,H\n- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> P,L,H\n- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> S at 1 and 4? So duplicate S? Letters S,L,H\n- ULNAS? Not matching pattern (should be A at 3, S at 4).\n\nOther options:\n\n- CLASH: but C was marked absent in COAST? Yes, C is forbidden. So CLASH is invalid.\n- BRASH: B R A S H -> R is forbidden? Yes, R was in guess 1 and marked absent. So forbidden. So not BRASH.\n\nAlso, ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And A is placed at 3, so if we have A at 1, we don\'t know if it\'s allowed or if it\'s the same A.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word. Letters: A, B, H.\n\nAnother word: BANUS? Not common. Or DANUS? Not.\n\n- LAPIS: L A P I S -> but I is forbidden? And no: LAPIS: L(1), A(2)? A at position 2? But we need A at 3? Pattern: should be __A S _, so first two letters, then A at 3. LAPIS doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching pattern.\n\nWe also have: SWASH: S W A S H -> S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S? And W,H.\n\nSo possibilities: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH, SLASH, SMASH, SWASH, ABASH.\n\nWe need to pick one that helps us test the most.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates. To be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that reuses as few known letters as possible? But we cannot avoid A and S.\n\nWe want to test new letters.\n\nFor example, FLASH: tests F, L, H.\n\nGNASH: tests G, N, H.\n\nPLASH: tests P, L, H.\n\nSLASH: tests S (duplicate?), L, H.\n\nSince we already know S is at position 4, if we use SLASH, we might get:\n\n- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 will be marked absent (x) because the secret has S only at 4.\n- If it has two S\'s, then the S at position 1 will be marked as ""-"" (present but wrong position?) if the secret has S elsewhere? Actually, in feedback:\n\nIf the secret word has one S at position 4, and we guess SLASH, then:\n  - Position1: S -> wrong position? But since there is only one S and it is at position 4, and we are using S at position1, it would be marked as ""x"" (absent) because the S is accounted for at position4? No.\n\nStandard Wordle feedback: each letter is evaluated separately. If we have two S in the guess, and the secret has one S at position4, then the first S (position1) would be marked as not in the word (because the secret has only one S, which is at position4). The second S at position4 would be marked correct. So feedback: S(x) L(-) A(✓) S(✓) H(x). For L: if it\'s in the word, it would be present.\n\nBut in our case, we don\'t know if there is an L or not.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s delete words with duplicate letters: like SLASH (duplicate S), SMASH (duplicate S?), SWASH (duplicate S), ABASH (duplicate A? A at positions 1 and 3). FLASH: no duplicates. GNASH: no duplicates? GNASH: G,N,A,S,H - all unique. Similarly, PLASH: P,L,A,S,H - unique.\n\nABASH: A,B,S,H? There are two A\'s, so duplicate A.\n\nSo duplicates: SLASH, SWASH, SMASH, ABASH.\n\nWords without duplicates: FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nNow, which one? We want to test common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: H, L, N, P, etc.\n\nFLASH: F is not very common, L is common.\n\nGNASH: G and N, N common.\n\nPLASH: P is common, L common.\n\nBut note: position 5 is H in all of these. So we are also testing H.\n\nWe don\'t know if H is in the word.\n\nWe can choose one arbitrarily? Or we can estimate which one has more common letters.\n\nLet me pick FLASH because F and L are frequent enough.\n\nBut another consideration: we have to fill positions 1 and 2. We know nothing about them. By guessing FLASH, we test F at position1 and L at position2.\n\nSimilarly, GNASH tests G and N.\n\nAs per letter frequency, L is more common than G or P? In English, L is very common, while G, P, F are moderately common.\n\nBut F: about 2% frequency, L: 4%, N: 6.7%.\n\nSo N is more common. So GNASH might be better? GNASH: G (2%) and N (6.7%).\n\nFLASH: F (2%), L (4%).\n\nSo GNASH has a slightly higher chance? Because N is common.\n\nGHASH? Not a word.\n\nWe also have other words? Like KNISH? K N I S H -> but I is forbidden? Yes, KNISH has I at position3? Wait: KNISH: K(1), N(2), I(3), S(4), H(5). But we need A at position3? So KNISH cannot be because position3 must be A.\n\nNot matching pattern.\n\nAnother: WRASH? Not common.\n\nSo between FLASH, GNASH, PLASH.\n\nI think FLASH is a familiar word? So I\'ll go with FLASH.\n\nBut PLASH might be less common? Meaning a splash? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother option: HALAS? Not pattern.\n\nSo FLASH.\n\nBut FLASH: F(1) L(2) A(3) S(4) H(5)\n\nNow, forbidden letters are R,I,E,C,O,T. FLASH uses F,L,H - all allowed.\n\nSo we can input FLASH.\n\nWe hope to get feedback on F, L, H.\n\nIf any are in the word, we get - or ✓.\n\nTherefore, I choose FLASH.\n\nBut note: in the pattern, position 3 and 4 are fixed, so we must have A at 3 and S at 4.\n\nSo guess: FLASH.\n\nNow, output: <guess>FLASH</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, E are absent; A is present but not in position 2; S is correct at position 4.\n- **Guess 2 (COAST)**: C, O, T are absent; A is correct at position 3; S is confirmed correct at position 4.\n\nDeductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: **? ? A S ?** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed: A at position 3, S at position 4).\n2. Absent letters (not in the word): R, I, E, C, O, T.\n3. Remaining letters to test are common consonants like F, G, H, L, N, P, etc., since vowels are limited (A is placed, and E, I, O are absent).\n\nFor the third guess, I chose **FLASH** because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ _ A S _), retaining A and S in known positions.\n- It tests new, common letters (F, L, H) that haven\'t been used yet.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (R, I, E, C, O, T).\n- FLASH is a valid English word, and the results will help narrow down possibilities for positions 1, 2, and 5 efficiently.\n\n<guess>FLASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n1.

We have used the following letters in guesses (and know their status):\n\n- A: present (at position 3)\n- S: present (at position 4)\n- H: present (at position 5)\n- R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L: absent.\n\nSo the remaining letters (not used and not absent) are: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word of the form: [letter1][letter2] A S H\n\nWe need to find a valid English word that matches this pattern and uses letters from the remaining set.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- BASH: B A S H -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters. The pattern is _ _ A S H, so two letters before ""A"", so it must be 5 letters.\n\nSo words ending with ""ASH"": but we have two letters before A.\n\nExamples:\n\n- DASH: D A S H -> again, 4 letters? No, DASH is 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n5-letter words ending with ""ASH"" are not common? Actually, we have:\n\n- ABASH: A B A S H -> but we have A at position 1? And A at position 3? But we know position 3 is A, so that would be duplicate A? And we have A at position 1? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated. Also, in ABASH, the pattern is A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern. But we have A at position 1 and 3. Is that allowed? It could be, but we haven\'t ruled it out.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn\'t necessarily mean there is only one A. It could have two A\'s. But in the second guess, we had A at position 3 and it was correct. So if the word has two A\'s, then the first A in the first guess (position 2) might have been marked as present even if it was at position 1 or 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But now we know it is at position 3. So if there is another A, it could be at position 1 or 5? But position 5 is H, so not A. So if there is a duplicate A, it must be at position 1.\n\nBut in ABASH, we have A at position 1 and 3. So that is possible.\n\nBut we also have to check the letters: ABASH uses A, B, S, H. We know A, S, H are in the word. B is a new letter. But we have to see if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B, and it\'s not in the absent list. So B is allowed.\n\nBut ABASH has A at position 1? We don\'t know if that is correct.\n\nAnother word: REHASH? But R and E are absent? R is in the absent list, so not allowed.\n\n- SMASH: S M A S H -> but S is at position 1? And we have S at position 4. So duplicate S? But also, S is in the absent list? No, S is present. But we have used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4. So if the secret word has only one S, then S at position 1 would be absent. But in this case, we are guessing SMASH, which has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret has two S\'s. Also, M is a new letter.\n\nBut SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So it matches the pattern? The pattern is _ _ A S H, so the first two letters are S and M? Then A at 3, S at 4, H at 5. So yes.\n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters: S is present, M is not tested, A and H present. But S is present, so we can use it? But we are using it at position 1. The absent letters are R,I,E,C,O,T,F,L. So S is not absent, so we can use it. But we are using it at a new position.\n\nHowever, we are trying to find the secret word, and we know S is at position 4. If we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words without worrying about duplicates for now.\n\nOther words:\n\n- GNASH: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> G and N are new. We haven\'t tested G or N. And they are not in the absent list.\n\n- PLASH: P(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> but L is absent? From the third guess, L was marked absent. So we cannot use L. So PLASH is invalid.\n\n- SLASH: S(1), L(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> L is absent, so invalid.\n\n- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> W is new, but duplicate S? And L not used? W is allowed.\n\nBut we have to avoid L? SWASH doesn\'t have L. So it\'s S, W, A, S, H. But we know L is absent, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are using S at position 1.\n\nNow, back to ABASH: A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So duplicate A? And B is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nAnother word: QUASH? Q U A S H -> but then the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). So U is a vowel? And Q and U are new. But Q is not common.\n\n- SQUASH? That\'s 6 letters.\n\n- AWASH: A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5) -> duplicate A? And W.\n\nBut we have the pattern: A at 1 and 3? So it matches.\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is duplicated.\n\nWe also have: BASH followed by a letter? No, we need 5 letters.\n\nAnother: PASH? 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5.\n\nLet me think of more words:\n\n- DASHY? D A S H Y -> but then A is at position 2? We need A at position 3. So D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but that doesn\'t match because we need S at position 4? Here S is at 3 and H at 4? But we require position 3 to be A and 4 to be S. So not.\n\n- No, the pattern is fixed: position 3: A, position 4: S, position 5: H. So the word must end with ""ASH"" but with two letters before the A.\n\nSo the structure is: [letter][letter] A S H\n\nCommon words:\n\n- ABASH\n- AWASH\n- GNASH\n- SMASH (if we allow duplicate S)\n- SWASH (duplicate S)\n- TRASH? But T is absent? T was in COAST and marked absent. So not.\n- BRASH? B R A S H -> R is absent? R was in RAISE and marked absent. So not.\n- CRASH? C and R absent.\n- DRASH? Not common.\n\nSo the candidates from the remaining letters:\n\n- ABASH: uses A (duplicate?), B\n- AWASH: uses A (duplicate?), W\n- GNASH: G, N\n- SMASH: S (duplicate?), M\n- SWASH: S (duplicate?), W\n\nWe also have:\n\n- KAPAS? Not matching.\n- MANAS? M A N A S -> not matching pattern (A at 2 and 4? We need A at 3).\n- PAPAS? P A P A S -> not matching.\n\nAnother: GAZSH? Not a word.\n\nSo the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, GNASH, SMASH, SWASH.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nWe have 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess out of 6).\n\nWe can try to avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty? Or we can test for duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know the secret word has at least one A, one S, and one H. If we guess a word with duplicate A or S, we might get feedback that tells us about duplicates.\n\nBut we can also try to guess a word without duplicates to see if it fits.\n\nFor example, GNASH has no duplicates: G, N, A, S, H. All unique.\n\nSimilarly, ABASH has duplicate A, AWASH has duplicate A, SMASH and SWASH have duplicate S.\n\nSo if we guess GNASH, and it is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nIf we guess ABASH, we test for duplicate A and B.\n\nBut we don\'t have much information about the first two letters.\n\nWe can also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon letters for position 1: B, G, M, N, W, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that doesn\'t use A, S, H? But we have to use A, S, H at positions 3,4,5 because they are fixed. So we must include them.\n\nSo we have to use A, S, H.\n\nThe only freedom is the first two letters.\n\nWe can try GNASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters.\n\nIf we guess GNASH and it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nFor example, if G is in the word, then we know it must be at position 1? But we don\'t know the position. It could be at position 1 or 2? But in GNASH, G is at position 1. If the secret word has G, but not at position 1, then we get a \'-\' for G. Similarly for N.\n\nBut we have only two positions to fill, so if we get feedback that G is present but not at 1, then it must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nSo that would be very informative.\n\nWhereas if we guess a word with duplicate, like ABASH, and if the secret word doesn\'t have duplicate A, then we might get feedback that the first A is absent? But we know there is an A at position 3, so if we guess A at position 1 and it\'s not in the word (because no duplicate), then it would be marked absent. But that would tell us there is no duplicate A.\n\nBut we are limited on guesses.\n\nI think GNASH is a good candidate.\n\nWe also have other words like:\n\n- MNASH? Not a word.\n- PNASH? Not.\n\nSo let\'s go with GNASH.\n\nBut GNASH is a word: to gnash the teeth.\n\nSo I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we guess GNASH.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: G(1), N(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Perfect.\n\nAnd letters: G and N are not in the absent list.\n\nSo we output: <guess>GNASH</guess>\n\nIf it\'s not correct, we get feedback on G and N.\n\nBut we hope it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider BASH with a letter? But we need 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: DASH + something? Not.\n\nI think GNASH is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: RAISE**  \n  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - R, I, E are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: COAST**  \n  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - C, O, T are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n\n- **Guess 3: FLASH**  \n  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  \n  Insights:  \n  - F, L are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n  - H is **correct** at position 5.  \n\n### Deductions\n1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  \n   - Position 3: **A**  \n   - Position 4: **S**  \n   - Position 5: **H**  \n   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  \n\n2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  \n   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L (from all feedback).  \n\n3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  \n   - Available letters (not absent and not yet confirmed): B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n   - We need a valid 5-letter English word matching `_ _ A S H`.  \n\n4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words):  \n   - **GNASH**: G N A S H (fits pattern, tests new letters G and N).  \n   - **ABASH**: A B A S H (tests duplicate A and B, but A at position 1 is uncertain).  \n   - **AWASH**: A W A S H (tests duplicate A and W).  \n   - **SMASH**: S M A S H (tests duplicate S and M).  \n   - **SWASH**: S W A S H (tests duplicate S and W).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Goal**: Test new letters and avoid duplicates to reduce uncertainty.  \n  - **GNASH** is optimal because:  \n    - It uses **G** and **N** (common consonants not tested yet).  \n    - No duplicate letters (unlike ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH), ensuring cleaner feedback.  \n    - If incorrect, feedback on G and N will directly reveal their status (present/absent) and positions, narrowing the possibilities to 1-2 remaining words.  \n- **Why not others?**  \n  - **ABASH/AWASH**: Risk of duplicate A (unknown if secret has two A\'s).  \n  - **SMASH/SWASH**: Risk of duplicate S (S is already fixed at position 4).  \n\nGiven the pattern `_ _ A S H` and absent letters, **GNASH** is a strong guess to maximize information or solve the puzzle.\n\n<guess>GNASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\nGuess 4: GNASH -> FEEDBACK: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for four guesses:\n\n1.

Guess 3: FLASH -> Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n   - F, L absent.\n   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).\n   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).\n   - H correct at position 5.\n\n4. Guess 4: GNASH -> Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n   - G, N absent.\n   - A correct at position 3 (confirmed).\n   - S correct at position 4 (confirmed).\n   - H correct at position 5 (confirmed).\n\nFrom the feedback, we know the secret word has:\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: H\n- So the pattern is: _ _ A S H\n\nWe also know the following letters are absent: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.\n\nThe absent letters are: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.\n\nThe remaining letters (from the alphabet) that haven\'t been tested or are not absent: \nB, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A S H using only the remaining letters and the known letters (A, S, H at fixed positions).\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern and use the available letters:\n\n- We need two letters at the start that form a valid word with ""ASH"" at the end.\n\nCommon words ending with ""ASH"":\n- ABASH: But A is at position 1? We have A at position 3, so if we use ABASH, it would be A(1), B(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate A. But we don\'t know if duplicate A is allowed. However, we have not been told that A is duplicated, so it might be. Also, B is an available letter.\n- AWASH: Similarly, A(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate A, and W is available.\n- Other possibilities: \n  - BASH: but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. So not.\n  - CASH: 4 letters.\n  - DASH: 4 letters.\n  - We need 5-letter words.\n\nOther 5-letter words:\n- SMASH: S(1), M(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). This has duplicate S. S is at position 1 and 4. But we know S is at position 4, so if we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate. M is available.\n- SWASH: S(1), W(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Duplicate S, and W available.\n- Other: \n  - QUASH: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). Q and U are available. But Q is not very common.\n  - SQUASH is 6 letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So let\'s list possible words:\n\n1. ABASH: Uses A (duplicate), B. But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not in the absent list.\n2. AWASH: Uses A (duplicate), W.\n3. SMASH: Uses S (duplicate), M.\n4. SWASH: Uses S (duplicate), W.\n5. QUASH: Uses Q, U.\n\nWe also have:\n- PASH: 4 letters? Not 5.\n- KAPAS: Not matching pattern (A at position 2?).\n- MANAS: Not matching (A at 2 and 4?).\n- PAPAS: Not matching.\n\nAnother word: UMIAK? Not ending with ASH.\n\nSo the main candidates are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.\n\nWe have 2 guesses left (since we are on the fifth guess out of 6).\n\nWe need to choose one. Since we don\'t know about duplicates, we might have to test.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A, but it could be the only one. Similarly, for S, we have only seen it at position 4.\n\nWe can try to avoid duplicates first? But we have limited options.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t assume duplicates, but we don\'t have any word without duplicates in the candidate list? \n\nWhat about words that don\'t use A or S at the start? But we have to have A at 3 and S at 4, so the only duplicates would be if we put A or S at positions 1 or 2.\n\nBut in the candidates, ABASH and AWASH have A at position 1, and SMASH and SWASH have S at position 1.\n\nQUASH has no duplicate, but uses Q and U.\n\nSo QUASH is a candidate without duplicates: Q(1), U(2), A(3), S(4), H(5). All letters are unique.\n\nAnd Q and U are available.\n\nBut QUASH is a valid word: to quash a rebellion.\n\nSo we can consider QUASH.\n\nNow, among ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.\n\nWe want to choose one that might be more common or that tests letters that are more likely.\n\nBut we don\'t have frequency information.\n\nWe can choose QUASH because it has no duplicates and tests two new letters (Q and U).\n\nIf we guess QUASH and it\'s not correct, we get feedback on Q and U.\n\nBut Q is a rare letter, so it might not be in the word.\n\nSimilarly, we can try a word with more common letters? But the remaining letters are not extremely common.\n\nAnother candidate: I think we missed one.\n\nWhat about ""DASHY""? But D A S H Y -> pattern: D(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5). But we need A at position 3 and S at position 4? Here A is at 2 and S at 3, which doesn\'t match.\n\nNot.\n\n""BASH"" with a suffix? Not 5 letters.\n\nSo the candidates are limited.\n\nWe can try SMASH: S M A S H. This tests M and also tests if there is a duplicate S.\n\nBut if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 1 would be marked absent, and we know S is at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, for ABASH, if there is no duplicate A, then the A at position 1 would be marked absent.\n\nBut we know the secret word has at least one A at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s list the possibilities for the secret word:\n\nThe secret word is ? ? A S H\n\nWith the first two letters being from B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ABASH: A and B\n- AWASH: A and W\n- SMASH: S and M\n- SWASH: S and W\n- QUASH: Q and U\n- Other rare ones: like UMASH? Not a word.\n\nWe also have ""PYXASH""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think the common ones are ABASH, AWASH, SMASH, SWASH, QUASH.\n\nNow, to decide:\n\n- If we guess QUASH and it\'s correct, we win.\n\n- If not, we get feedback on Q and U.\n\nBut Q is rare, so it might be more efficient to guess a word without Q.\n\nWe can guess SMASH to test M and duplicate S.\n\nSimilarly, we can guess ABASH to test B and duplicate A.\n\nBut note: we have two guesses left, so we can afford to test.\n\nBut we want to solve as soon as possible.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that uses two new letters and doesn\'t duplicate A or S, but the only one is QUASH.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without duplicates and without Q.\n\nFor example, with M and W: but we don\'t have a word ""MWASH"" or something.\n\nOr B and M: ""BMASH"" not a word.\n\nSo QUASH is the only one without duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the secret word might be ""AWASH"" or ""ABASH"" or ""SMASH"", which are more common than ""QUASH"".\n\n""SMASH"" is a very common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABASH"" means to embarrass, which is less common.\n\n""AWASH"" means covered with water, also less common.\n\n""QUASH"" is a verb, meaning to suppress.\n\nBut in terms of frequency, ""SMASH"" might be the most common.\n\nAlso, ""SWASH"" is less common (as in swashbuckle).\n\nSo perhaps ""SMASH"" is a good guess.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are using S at position 1, which might be a duplicate.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""SMASH"", then we win.\n\nIf not, and if the feedback shows that the first S is absent (because the secret has only one S at position 4), then we know there is no duplicate S, and we also get that M is absent? Or if M is present, we get feedback.\n\nBut if we guess SMASH:\n\n- If the secret word is SMASH: then we get all correct.\n\n- If the secret word is ABASH: then for SMASH: \n  - S at position 1: since the secret has no S at position 1 (because it has only one S at position 4), so S(1) would be marked absent (x).\n  - M at position 2: the secret has B at position 2? In ABASH, position 2 is B, so M is absent? So M(x).\n  - A(3): correct (✓)\n  - S(4): correct (✓)\n  - H(5): correct (✓)\n  So feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n\n- Similarly, if the secret is AWASH: then for SMASH: \n  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has A at 1 and S at 4.\n  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has W at 2.\n  - A(3): ✓\n  - S(4): ✓\n  - H(5): ✓\n  Same feedback.\n\n- If the secret is SWASH: then for SMASH:\n  - S(1): present? But in SWASH, S is at 1 and 4. So if we guess SMASH, which has S at 1 and 4, then:\n    - S at 1: the secret has S at 1, so ✓? But wait, the secret has two S\'s? So S at 1: correct (✓) because it matches position.\n    - M at 2: secret has W at 2, so M is absent (x)\n    - A(3): ✓\n    - S(4): ✓\n    - H(5): ✓\n  So feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n\n- If the secret is QUASH: then for SMASH:\n  - S(1): absent (x) because secret has Q at 1 and no duplicate S (only at 4).\n  - M(2): absent (x) because secret has U at 2.\n  - A(3): ✓\n  - S(4): ✓\n  - H(5): ✓\n  Feedback: S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n\nSo if we guess SMASH, the feedback will tell us:\n\n- If we get all ✓, then it\'s SMASH.\n\n- If we get S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it must be SWASH (because only SWASH has S at position 1).\n\n- If we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.\n\nBut we won\'t be able to distinguish between ABASH, AWASH, and QUASH with that feedback.\n\nWe would need another guess.\n\nBut we have only one guess left after this.\n\nSo if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then we have three possibilities: ABASH, AWASH, QUASH.\n\nAnd we have one guess left. We can guess one of them, but if we guess wrong, we lose.\n\nSo that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that can distinguish between these possibilities.\n\nBut we are forced to guess a word that fits the pattern? Because we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5.\n\nSo for the fifth guess, we have to guess one of the candidates.\n\nWe can guess ABASH, for example.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win.\n\nIf not, then we know it\'s not ABASH, and we can guess AWASH or QUASH in the sixth guess.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess AWASH and it\'s wrong, then we have to choose between ABASH and QUASH.\n\nBut we have no information about B, W, Q, U.\n\nSo it\'s risky.\n\nTo maximize the chance, we can guess the most common word.\n\nBut we don\'t know which is most common.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that uses one of the letters from the candidates but not the others.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nFor example, we can try to guess a word that has B but not W or Q, but we have to have A at 3, S at 4, H at 5, so the only word with B is ABASH.\n\nSimilarly, the only word with W is AWASH and SWASH, but SWASH has duplicate S.\n\nAnd the only word with Q is QUASH.\n\nSo we cannot form a word that tests B without committing to ABASH.\n\nTherefore, we have to guess one of the candidates.\n\nGiven that, we should guess the most common word.\n\nAccording to word frequency, ""SMASH"" is more common than the others.\n\n""ABASH"" is less common, ""AWASH"" is even less common, ""QUASH"" is moderately common, ""SWASH"" is less common.\n\nSo I think ""SMASH"" is a good guess.\n\nIf it\'s not ""SMASH"", and we get feedback indicating it\'s not, then we can use the last guess for one of the others.\n\nBut as above, if we get S(x) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓), then it could be ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH.\n\nThen for the sixth guess, we have to pick one.\n\nWe can pick the most common among them, which might be QUASH or ABASH.\n\nBut it\'s a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not a candidate but tests the letters? But we have to have the pattern _ _ A S H, so we cannot change the last three letters.\n\nWe are forced to have A, S, H at 3,4,5.\n\nSo we cannot introduce a new letter at position 3,4,5.\n\nThe only flexibility is positions 1 and 2.\n\nSo we have to guess a word with two new letters at 1 and 2.\n\nSo we cannot avoid guessing one of the candidates.\n\nTherefore, I will go with SMASH.\n\nIf it\'s correct, great. If not, we get feedback that will help us for the last guess.\n\nSo guess: SMASH\n\nOutput: <guess>SMASH</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:  \n  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - R, I, E are **absent**.  \n  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2 (COAST)**:  \n  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  \n  Insights:  \n  - C, O, T are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3.  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n\n- **Guess 3 (FLASH)**:  \n  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  \n  Insights:  \n  - F, L are **absent**.  \n  - A is **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  \n  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  \n  - H is **correct** at position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 4 (GNASH)**:  \n  Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  \n  Insights:  \n  - G, N are **absent**.  \n  - A, S, H are **correct** at positions 3, 4, 5 (confirmed).  \n\n### Deductions\n1. **Fixed positions in the secret word**:  \n   - Position 3: **A**  \n   - Position 4: **S**  \n   - Position 5: **H**  \n   - The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A S H` (positions 1 and 2 are unknown).  \n\n2. **Absent letters (cannot be in the word)**:  \n   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N.  \n\n3. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 2**:  \n   - Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n4. **Possible candidate words** (based on common English words matching `_ _ A S H`):  \n   - **SMASH** (S at position 1, M at position 2)  \n   - **SWASH** (S at position 1, W at position 2)  \n   - **ABASH** (A at position 1, B at position 2)  \n   - **AWASH** (A at position 1, W at position 2)  \n   - **QUASH** (Q at position 1, U at position 2)  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 5\n- **Goal**: Guess a high-probability candidate to solve the puzzle or narrow options.  \n  - **SMASH** is chosen because:  \n    - It is a **common English word** (more frequent than other candidates like ABASH, AWASH, or QUASH).  \n    - It tests **S at position 1** (possible duplicate S) and **M** (new letter).  \n    - Feedback will resolve ambiguity:  \n      - If **SMASH is correct**, the game ends.  \n      - If **S is marked ✓ at position 1**, the secret must be **SWASH** (only other candidate with S at position 1).  \n      - If **S is marked x at position 1**, the secret is one of **ABASH/AWASH/QUASH**, and the last guess can target these.\n\n<guess>SMASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\nGuess 4: GNASH -> FEEDBACK: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\nGuess 5: SMASH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for five guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> 
   Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   -> R, I, E absent; A present but not at position 2; S correct at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST ->
   Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   -> C, O, T absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4.

3. Guess 3: FLASH ->
   Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> F, L absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4; H correct at position 5.

4. Guess 4: GNASH ->
   Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> G, N absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4; H correct at position 5.

5. Guess 5: SMASH ->
   Feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> S at position 1 is correct (so the secret word has S at position 1? But wait, let's look carefully).

   Note: In the feedback for SMASH (which is S M A S H), the feedback is:
     S(✓) at position 1, M(x) at position 2, A(✓) at position 3, S at position 4 is ✓ (but we already know S is at position 4), and H(✓) at position 5.

   This feedback indicates that:
   - The first S is correct at position 1.
   - M is absent (not in the word).
   - A at position 3 is correct (as known).
   - S at position 4 is correct (as known).
   - H at position 5 is correct (as known).

   This implies that the secret word has S at position 1 and position 4? Because we have two S's in the guess, and both are marked correctly: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

   Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S's: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

   Also, M is absent.

Now, from the pattern, positions 3,4,5: A, S, H are fixed.

With the new information from guess 5:
- The secret word has S at position 1 (so the word starts with S).
- And S at position 4 (already known).
- So the word is S _ A S H.

Also, M is absent.

Now, what about position 2? We don't know that letter yet.

We have to find a letter for position 2 that forms a valid word S _ A S H.

We also have the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M.

The remaining letters: B, D, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words fit the pattern ""S _ A S H""?

Possible words:

- SWASH: S W A S H -> this would fit, and W is an available letter.
- Other words? 

Common words:

- SLASH? But L is absent? From guess 3, L is marked absent, so not.
- STASH? But T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent.
- SPASH? Not a common word.
- SUASH? Not common.
- SHASH? Not common.

SWASH is a word (meaning to swagger or splash).

Is there any other?

- SQASH? Not a word.

So SWASH is the most likely.

Indeed, given the pattern S _ A S H and the absent letters, SWASH seems the only common possibility.

Therefore, we should guess SWASH.

But note: we have one guess left (this is the sixth guess).

So we guess SWASH.

  - M is **absent**.  
  - A, S (position 4), H **correct** (confirmed).  

### Deductions
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 1: **S** (from SMASH feedback).  
   - Position 2: **Unknown** (one letter remaining).  
   - Position 3: **A** (fixed).  
   - Position 4: **S** (fixed, duplicate).  
   - Position 5: **H** (fixed).  
   - Pattern: **S _ A S H**.

   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M (totaling 11 exclusions).  

3. **Remaining possible letters for position 2**:  
   - Available: B, D, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Possible word**:  
   - **SWASH** (S W A S H) is the **only common English word** fitting:  
     - W is untested and valid.  
     - Confirms to the pattern S _ A S H.  

### Final Guess
- **SWASH** is the conclusive solution, leveraging all feedback to isolate the secret word.

<guess>SWASH</guess>",SWASH,"We are given feedback for five guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> 
   Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   -> R, I, E absent; A present but not at position 2; S correct at position 4.

2. Guess 2: COAST ->
   Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)
   -> C, O, T absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4.

3. Guess 3: FLASH ->
   Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> F, L absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4; H correct at position 5.

4. Guess 4: GNASH ->
   Feedback: G(x) N(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> G, N absent; A correct at position 3; S correct at position 4; H correct at position 5.

5. Guess 5: SMASH ->
   Feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)
   -> S at position 1 is correct (so the secret word has S at position 1? But wait, let's look carefully).

   Note: In the feedback for SMASH (which is S M A S H), the feedback is:
     S(✓) at position 1, M(x) at position 2, A(✓) at position 3, S at position 4 is ✓ (but we already know S is at position 4), and H(✓) at position 5.

   This feedback indicates that:
   - The first S is correct at position 1.
   - M is absent (not in the word).
   - A at position 3 is correct (as known).
   - S at position 4 is correct (as known).
   - H at position 5 is correct (as known).

   This implies that the secret word has S at position 1 and position 4? Because we have two S's in the guess, and both are marked correctly: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

   Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S's: one at position 1 and one at position 4.

   Also, M is absent.

Now, from the pattern, positions 3,4,5: A, S, H are fixed.

With the new information from guess 5:
- The secret word has S at position 1 (so the word starts with S).
- And S at position 4 (already known).
- So the word is S _ A S H.

Also, M is absent.

Now, what about position 2? We don't know that letter yet.

We have to find a letter for position 2 that forms a valid word S _ A S H.

We also have the absent letters: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M.

The absent letters so far: R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M.

The remaining letters: B, D, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words fit the pattern ""S _ A S H""?

Possible words:

- SWASH: S W A S H -> this would fit, and W is an available letter.
- Other words? 

Common words:

- SLASH? But L is absent? From guess 3, L is marked absent, so not.
- STASH? But T is absent? From guess 2, T is absent.
- SPASH? Not a common word.
- SUASH? Not common.
- SHASH? Not common.

SWASH is a word (meaning to swagger or splash).

Is there any other?

- SQASH? Not a word.

So SWASH is the most likely.

Indeed, given the pattern S _ A S H and the absent letters, SWASH seems the only common possibility.

Therefore, we should guess SWASH.

But note: we have one guess left (this is the sixth guess).

So we guess SWASH.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:  
  Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)  
  Insights:  
  - R, I, E are **absent**.  
  - A is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4.  

- **Guess 2 (COAST)**:  
  Feedback: C(x) O(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - C, O, T are **absent**.  
  - A is **correct** at position 3.  
  - S is **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  

- **Guess 3 (FLASH)**:  
  Feedback: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - F, L **absent**.  
  - A **correct** at position 3 (confirmed).  
  - S **correct** at position 4 (confirmed).  
  - H **correct** at position 5.  

- **Guess 4 (GNASH)**:  
  Feedback: G(x) N(x A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - G, N **absent**.  
  - A, S, H **correct** at positions 3, 4, 5 (confirmed).  

- **Guess 5 (SMASH)**:  
  Feedback: S(✓) M(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)  
  Insights:  
  - **S is correct at position 1** (indicating a duplicate S).  
  - M is **absent**.  
  - A, S (position 4), H **correct** (confirmed).  

### Deductions
1. **Secret word structure**:  
   - Position 1: **S** (from SMASH feedback).  
   - Position 2: **Unknown** (one letter remaining).  
   - Position 3: **A** (fixed).  
   - Position 4: **S** (fixed, duplicate).  
   - Position 5: **H** (fixed).  
   - Pattern: **S _ A S H**.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - R, I, E, C, O, T, F, L, G, N, M (totaling 11 exclusions).  

3. **Remaining possible letters for position 2**:  
   - Available: B, D, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

4. **Possible word**:  
   - **SWASH** (S W A S H) is the **only common English word** fitting:  
     - W is untested and valid.  
     - Confirms to the pattern S _ A S H.  

### Final Guess
- **SWASH** is the conclusive solution, leveraging all feedback to isolate the secret word.",Guess 6: SWASH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
