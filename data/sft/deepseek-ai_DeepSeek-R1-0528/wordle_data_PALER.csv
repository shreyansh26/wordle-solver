We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - R is not at position 2.
 - A is not at position 3.
 - E is not at position 5.

 Also, we must avoid using C and N in future guesses.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C or N.
 - Contains R, A, and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 - We can also include other common letters to test.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we have three letters we know are present. We can try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has R, A, E and two new letters (avoiding C and N). Also, we want to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

 Possible positions for:
   R: can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know the word length is 5, so all positions except 2. However, we must avoid the positions where they were marked as absent? Actually, the feedback only tells us that they are not in the position we guessed. So R cannot be at position 2, but it can be at 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1,2,4,5.
 E cannot be at position 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test other common letters. Since we have three known letters, we can try to use two new letters that are common (like T, S, L, etc.).

 Let's try to form a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words:
 - ""LATER"": contains L, A, T, E, R -> but note: we have A and E and R. Also, we avoid C and N. However, let's check the positions:
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   For A: position 2 (was not position 3 in the first guess, so allowed) -> but we don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.
   For E: position 4 (was not position 5, so allowed).
   For R: position 5 (was not position 2, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if T and L are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests two new letters (T and L) and places the known letters in new positions.

 Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word? I think it's accepted in Wordle, meaning a financial term). But let's stick to common words.

 Alternatively, ""STARE"": S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> wait, A is at position 3? But in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and E at position 5.

 So ""STARE"" has A at position 3? That's the same as the first guess. We know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

 Let's try ""STARE"" with different arrangement? Actually, we can rearrange the known letters.

 How about ""RATES"": 
   R at 1 -> but we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. However, we are allowed to try. But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong. Now we put it at position 1. Also, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the previous positions: 
   R: was at 2, now at 1 -> new position.
   A: was at 3, now at 2 -> new position.
   E: was at 5, now at 4 -> new position.

 And we test T and S.

 Another candidate: ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we should avoid that.

 So ""RAISE"" is not good because E is at position 5.

 How about ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we know it's not there. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid.

 We want to maximize information. So we should avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Let me try to list words that have R, A, E and two new letters, and place R not at 2, A not at 3, E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: R? Then A and E can be at 2,3,4,5 but avoiding A at 3 and E at 5.
   Example: R at 1, A at 2 (allowed because A was at 3, not 2), then E at 4 (avoiding 5). Then we need two more letters. Let's put T and S: ""RATES"" as above.

   Or: R at 1, A at 4, E at 2: ""R_ _ A E"" -> but we need a word. ""RIPAE""? Not a word. ""RUSAE""? Not common.

   Another: without R at 1? Let A be at 1: then R can be at 3,4,5 (avoiding 2) and E at 2,3,4 (avoiding 5). Example: ""A__ R E"" but we need two more letters. ""AERIE""? That has two E's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, ""AERIE"" has E at position 5? No: A(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), E(5) -> E at 5 is not allowed.

   How about ""ALERT"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
        A: position 1 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
        E: position 3 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
        R: position 4 (was 2, so new) -> allowed.
        And we test L and T.

   This seems good.

   Another: ""ALTER"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
        A: position 1 -> new.
        E: position 4 -> new (avoiding 5).
        R: position 5 -> new (avoiding 2).

   Also good.

 But note: we have three known letters (R, A, E) and we are including two new ones (L, T). We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common consonants. S and T are very common.

 Let me consider ""RATES"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   This uses S and T, which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S or T. But that's the point of guessing.

 Another candidate: ""TASER"": 
   T at 1, A at 2, S at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   This also uses S and T.

 However, in ""TASER"", A is at position 2 and R at position 5. We don't have any conflict with the previous forbidden positions.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5, which is allowed. Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, which is allowed. E was at 5 and now at 4, which is allowed.

 So both ""RATES"" and ""TASER"" are good.

 I think ""TASER"" is a common word.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Let me choose ""TASER"" because it starts with T (another common letter) and we haven't tested T and S.

 So my second guess: TASER

 But let me check: we are avoiding C and N, and we are including R, A, E (which we know are in the word) and T and S (which we don't know).

 This should be a good guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARE"" but we have to rearrange to avoid A at 3 and E at 5. We can do ""STARE"" as S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A at 3 is the same as the first guess? We know A is not at 3, so that would be a waste. So we avoid.

 How about ""SALET""? 
   S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)
   A: at 2 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
   E: at 4 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
   But we don't have R? We know R is in the word, so we must include R. Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R, A, and E.

 Therefore, ""TASER"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""TASER"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
3. Places R, A, and E in new positions (not 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters like **T** and **S** for efficiency.

A strong candidate is **""taser""**:
- **T** at position 1 (new letter).
- **A** at position 2 (previously at 3, now a new position).
- **S** at position 3 (new letter).
- **E** at position 4 (previously at 5, now a new position).
- **R** at position 5 (previously at 2, now a new position).

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (T and S) to gather more information.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - R is not at position 2.
 - A is not at position 3.
 - E is not at position 5.

 Also, we must avoid using C and N in future guesses.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C or N.
 - Contains R, A, and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 - We can also include other common letters to test.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we have three letters we know are present. We can try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has R, A, E and two new letters (avoiding C and N). Also, we want to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

 Possible positions for:
   R: can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know the word length is 5, so all positions except 2. However, we must avoid the positions where they were marked as absent? Actually, the feedback only tells us that they are not in the position we guessed. So R cannot be at position 2, but it can be at 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1,2,4,5.
 E cannot be at position 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test other common letters. Since we have three known letters, we can try to use two new letters that are common (like T, S, L, etc.).

 Let's try to form a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words:
 - ""LATER"": contains L, A, T, E, R -> but note: we have A and E and R. Also, we avoid C and N. However, let's check the positions:
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   For A: position 2 (was not position 3 in the first guess, so allowed) -> but we don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.
   For E: position 4 (was not position 5, so allowed).
   For R: position 5 (was not position 2, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if T and L are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests two new letters (T and L) and places the known letters in new positions.

 Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word? I think it's accepted in Wordle, meaning a financial term). But let's stick to common words.

 Alternatively, ""STARE"": S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> wait, A is at position 3? But in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and E at position 5.

 So ""STARE"" has A at position 3? That's the same as the first guess. We know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

 Let's try ""STARE"" with different arrangement? Actually, we can rearrange the known letters.

 How about ""RATES"": 
   R at 1 -> but we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. However, we are allowed to try. But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong. Now we put it at position 1. Also, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the previous positions: 
   R: was at 2, now at 1 -> new position.
   A: was at 3, now at 2 -> new position.
   E: was at 5, now at 4 -> new position.

 And we test T and S.

 Another candidate: ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we should avoid that.

 So ""RAISE"" is not good because E is at position 5.

 How about ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we know it's not there. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid.

 We want to maximize information. So we should avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Let me try to list words that have R, A, E and two new letters, and place R not at 2, A not at 3, E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: R? Then A and E can be at 2,3,4,5 but avoiding A at 3 and E at 5.
   Example: R at 1, A at 2 (allowed because A was at 3, not 2), then E at 4 (avoiding 5). Then we need two more letters. Let's put T and S: ""RATES"" as above.

   Or: R at 1, A at 4, E at 2: ""R_ _ A E"" -> but we need a word. ""RIPAE""? Not a word. ""RUSAE""? Not common.

   Another: without R at 1? Let A be at 1: then R can be at 3,4,5 (avoiding 2) and E at 2,3,4 (avoiding 5). Example: ""A__ R E"" but we need two more letters. ""AERIE""? That has two E's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, ""AERIE"" has E at position 5? No: A(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), E(5) -> E at 5 is not allowed.

   How about ""ALERT"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
        A: position 1 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
        E: position 3 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
        R: position 4 (was 2, so new) -> allowed.
        And we test L and T.

   This seems good.

   Another: ""ALTER"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
        A: position 1 -> new.
        E: position 4 -> new (avoiding 5).
        R: position 5 -> new (avoiding 2).

   Also good.

 But note: we have three known letters (R, A, E) and we are including two new ones (L, T). We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common consonants. S and T are very common.

 Let me consider ""RATES"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   This uses S and T, which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S or T. But that's the point of guessing.

 Another candidate: ""TASER"": 
   T at 1, A at 2, S at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   This also uses S and T.

 However, in ""TASER"", A is at position 2 and R at position 5. We don't have any conflict with the previous forbidden positions.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5, which is allowed. Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, which is allowed. E was at 5 and now at 4, which is allowed.

 So both ""RATES"" and ""TASER"" are good.

 I think ""TASER"" is a common word.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Let me choose ""TASER"" because it starts with T (another common letter) and we haven't tested T and S.

 So my second guess: TASER

 But let me check: we are avoiding C and N, and we are including R, A, E (which we know are in the word) and T and S (which we don't know).

 This should be a good guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARE"" but we have to rearrange to avoid A at 3 and E at 5. We can do ""STARE"" as S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A at 3 is the same as the first guess? We know A is not at 3, so that would be a waste. So we avoid.

 How about ""SALET""? 
   S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)
   A: at 2 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
   E: at 4 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
   But we don't have R? We know R is in the word, so we must include R. Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R, A, and E.

 Therefore, ""TASER"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""TASER"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
3. Places R, A, and E in new positions (not 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters like **T** and **S** for efficiency.

A strong candidate is **""taser""**:
- **T** at position 1 (new letter).
- **A** at position 2 (previously at 3, now a new position).
- **S** at position 3 (new letter).
- **E** at position 4 (previously at 5, now a new position).
- **R** at position 5 (previously at 2, now a new position).

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (T and S) to gather more information.

We are given feedback for the second guess ""taser"":
 T: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

 From this, we know:
 - T and S are not in the word.
 - A, E, and R are in the word and in the correct positions: 
      A is at position 2, 
      E is at position 4, 
      R is at position 5.

 Also, from the first guess, we knew that C and N are not in the word.

 Now, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   Position 2: A
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And we know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

 We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we now have placed) and no other letters from ""crane"" except these. But note: the first guess had R, A, E as present but in wrong positions, but now we have them in correct positions.

 The secret word pattern so far: _ A _ E R

 We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3.

 We know the letters that are not in the word: C, N, T, S.

 We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E R and uses only letters that are not excluded.

 Also, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 3.

 We have not tested many letters yet. We can try to use common letters that haven't been excluded.

 Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can use a word that might give us more information if we don't get it right.

 However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 letters already correct and in place. So we are in a good position.

 We can try to guess a word that has the form _ A _ E R and uses two new letters to test.

 But note: if we guess a word that has one of the unknown letters correct, we might get it right or get partial information.

 Since we have two blanks, we can also consider that the same letter might appear in both? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far.

 Let me think of words that match the pattern: ?A?ER

 Some possibilities:
   - BALER: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word (a person who bales)
   - HATER: but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - PAPER: P at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two P's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But note: the feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we haven't tested P. But wait, in ""paper"", the first P and the second P: if the word has only one P, then one of them would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, T and S are excluded, so HATER is out because of T.

 Let me list words ending with ""A_ER"" (so positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R) and positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

 Other words:
   - BAKER: B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - DATER: D at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - FAKER: F at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - GAMER: G at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - LAGER: L at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - MAKER: M at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - PAGER: P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - RAPER: R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would have two R's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates. However, we have R at position 5 and if we put R at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. Also, in the feedback for ""taser"", we had R at position 5 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates. So RAPER is a valid word? But we have to consider that if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known to be in the word in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we know R is in the word at position 5, but it might be the only R. So if we put R at position 1, and the word has only one R (at position 5), then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent (x). But we are trying to find the word, so we can use that to test.

 However, we have limited guesses. We might want to avoid using known letters in new positions because we already know they are in the word? But we don't know if they appear again.

 Alternatively, we can use two new letters to maximize information.

 Since we have two positions, we can try a word that uses two common letters that haven't been tested.

 Let me choose ""BAKER"": 
   B and K are new. If we get feedback, we will know about B and K.

 But note: we have other possibilities. We might get it right.

 However, we are not sure. We can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"", but T is excluded. Or ""LATER"", but T is excluded.

 Since T is excluded, we can remove any word that has T.

 Similarly, S is excluded.

 So the word cannot have T or S.

 Now, let's list the words that fit the pattern and don't have T, S, C, N:

   BALER, BAKER, FAKER, GAMER, LAGER, MAKER, PAGER, RAPER, WAFER, HAVER, etc.

 But we must choose one that is valid.

 We can choose ""BAKER"" to test B and K.

 But note: if we guess ""BAKER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

 However, we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess. We have 4 more after this.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to cover more possibilities.

 But note: we have many words to choose from. We might also consider that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

 I think ""BAKER"" is a good choice.

 But let me see: if we guess ""BAKER"", and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B -> if it's correct, we get ✓, else if it's present but wrong position we get -, else x.
   Position 3: K -> similarly.

 However, if we get both wrong, we know that the word is one of the others (like FAKER, MAKER, etc.) but without knowing which letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that appear in multiple possibilities, so that we can eliminate more.

 For example, if we choose ""PAGER"", we test P and G. But note that ""PAGER"" has P and G, which are not in ""BAKER"" or ""MAKER"". So if we get P and G wrong, then we know the word must be one that doesn't have P or G, like ""BAKER"", ""MAKER"", ""FAKER"", etc.

 But we don't have a word that covers two very common letters that appear in many of these options.

 Notice that in the list, the letters at position 1 and 3 are:

   Position 1: B, F, G, L, M, P, W, H, ... 
   Position 3: K, G, M, L, P, V, ...

 The letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER (but WAKER is a word? Yes, but we have to check if it's accepted). Similarly, G appears in GAMER, LAGER, PAGER.

 So if we choose a word that has K at position 3, we cover several possibilities.

 How about ""MAKER"": M at 1 and K at 3. Then if we get M and K correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

 But we don't know if M is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are not in the other possibilities? That might not be efficient.

 Since we have two unknowns, we can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"" but T is excluded, so no.

 Another idea: we know from the first guess that the word has no C, N, and now we know no T, S. Also, we have A, E, R fixed.

 The first guess ""crane"" had the letter 'A' at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at position 2 and it's correct. So that is consistent.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and now we have it at position 5. And E was at 5 and now at 4.

 Now, we need to fill the first and third positions.

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   ""WATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""HATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""MAKER"" -> possible.

 But note: we have ""BAKER"", which is also common.

 Since we are not sure, and we have to choose one, I'll go with ""BAKER"" because it uses B and K, which are common.

 But wait, we have not tested B and K at all.

 So let's guess ""BAKER"".

 If the feedback for ""BAKER"" is:
   B: if it's at position 1 and correct, then ✓. If not, then we know it's not B at 1.
   Similarly for K at 3.

 And if both are correct, we win.

 If not, we narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that are in many of the possibilities? For example, the letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER. So if we test a word that has K at position 3, we can confirm if K is at position 3.

 But we can do that by guessing ""BAKER"", which has K at 3.

 If we guess ""BAKER"" and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B is either ✓ or x (or even - if it's in the word but not at 1? But we don't have any B in the word so far, so if it's present, it would be at position 1? Actually, if B is in the word but not at 1, then we get a '-'. Similarly for K.

 But note: we have only two positions open. So if B is not at 1, then it must be at position 3? But we have position 3 as K. So if B is in the word, it must be at position 3? But we are putting B at 1 and K at 3. So if the word has B at position 3, then we would get:
   Position 1: B -> x (because it's not at 1) or - (if it's in the word but at position 3). But we are putting K at position 3, so if the word has B at 3, then K would be wrong? 

 This might be confusing.

 Let me clarify: the word has fixed positions 2,4,5: A, E, R.
 The word has two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] E R

 We are guessing ""BAKER"": which is B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 The feedback will tell us:
   For B: 
        if the word has B at position 1: ✓
        if the word has B but not at 1: then it must be at position 3? But we are putting K at 3. So if the word has B at 3, then we would get for B: - (because it's in the word but at position 3? But we are putting B at 1, so if the word has B at 3, then the B at 1 is not present, so we get a '-' for B? Actually, no: the feedback for B would be '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. And then for K at position 3: we would get an 'x' because the word has B at 3, not K.

   Similarly, if the word has K at position 1, then we would get for B: x (if K is at 1, then B is not in the word) and for K: - (because K is in the word but not at position 3, but at position 1? But we are putting K at 3, so if K is at 1, then at position 3 we have a different letter. So we get for K: - and for B: x.

 But note: the word can only have one letter at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the possibilities are:

   If we get:
      B: ✓ and K: ✓ -> the word is BAKER.

      B: ✓ and K: x -> then the word is BA?ER, but the third letter is not K. So it could be BALER, BAMER? (but BAMER is not a word), or BAPER? (not common). Actually, common words: BALER, or maybe BADER? (not common). So if B is at 1 and K is not at 3, then we know the third letter is not K, and we have to try another.

      B: x and K: ✓ -> then the word is ?AKER, with the first letter not B. So it could be FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

      B: - and K: x -> this would mean B is in the word but not at 1, and K is not in the word. Since B is in the word but not at 1, it must be at position 3? But we have K at 3, so if B is at 3, then K is not. So the word would be ?ABER. But we have to check if that's a word: ""AB"" at positions 2 and 3? The word would be [letter] A B E R. Words: CABER? but C is excluded. TABER? T excluded. So probably not. Or maybe the word has B at position 3 and the first letter is something else. But then the word is [letter] A B E R. Is that a word? ""SABER"" -> S excluded. ""DABER"" -> not a word. So this case might not happen.

      Similarly, B: x and K: - -> meaning K is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at position 1? Then the word is K A ? E R. Words: KAPER? (which is a word, meaning one who kapes? not common). Or KAVER? not a word. So this case is unlikely.

      B: - and K: - -> meaning B is in the word but not at 1, and K is in the word but not at 3. Then the word must have B and K, but at which positions? The only positions are 1 and 3, but we are getting - for both, meaning they are in the word but not at the guessed positions. So B must be at 3 and K must be at 1? But then the word would be K A B E R -> ""KABER"" which is not a word. Or if the word has more than one of a letter? But we have only two positions. So this case is also unlikely.

 Therefore, the most likely outcomes are:
   - Both correct: we win.
   - B correct and K wrong: then the word is BALER (since B at 1 and the third letter is L) or maybe BADER? but not common. Or BAKER is the only common one with B at 1 and K at 3? But we are getting K wrong, so it must be a different letter at 3. So then we have to consider BALER, or perhaps other words like BAAED? not matching pattern.

   - B wrong and K correct: then the word is FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

   - Both wrong: then the word is not BAKER and doesn't have B or K? Then it could be GAMER, LAGER, PAGER, etc.

 So we can get a lot of information.

 But note: we have only two positions and we are testing two letters. It's efficient.

 Therefore, I will guess ""BAKER"".

 However, let me check if ""BAKER"" is a valid word in Wordle. Yes, it is.

 So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).
- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must match the pattern `_ A _ E R`.
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with new letters (not C, N, T, S).
- Common letters to test: **B**, **K**, **L**, **M**, **P**, **G** (high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out).
- A strong candidate is **""baker""**:
  - Tests **B** at position 1 and **K** at position 3.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if B is correct but K is wrong, consider ""baler""; if K is correct but B is wrong, consider ""faker"" or ""maker"").

<guess>baker</guess>",baker,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""taser"":
 T: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

 From this, we know:
 - T and S are not in the word.
 - A, E, and R are in the word and in the correct positions: 
      A is at position 2, 
      E is at position 4, 
      R is at position 5.

 Also, from the first guess, we knew that C and N are not in the word.

 Now, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   Position 2: A
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And we know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

 We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we now have placed) and no other letters from ""crane"" except these. But note: the first guess had R, A, E as present but in wrong positions, but now we have them in correct positions.

 The secret word pattern so far: _ A _ E R

 We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3.

 We know the letters that are not in the word: C, N, T, S.

 We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E R and uses only letters that are not excluded.

 Also, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 3.

 We have not tested many letters yet. We can try to use common letters that haven't been excluded.

 Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can use a word that might give us more information if we don't get it right.

 However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 letters already correct and in place. So we are in a good position.

 We can try to guess a word that has the form _ A _ E R and uses two new letters to test.

 But note: if we guess a word that has one of the unknown letters correct, we might get it right or get partial information.

 Since we have two blanks, we can also consider that the same letter might appear in both? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far.

 Let me think of words that match the pattern: ?A?ER

 Some possibilities:
   - BALER: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word (a person who bales)
   - HATER: but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - PAPER: P at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two P's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But note: the feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we haven't tested P. But wait, in ""paper"", the first P and the second P: if the word has only one P, then one of them would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, T and S are excluded, so HATER is out because of T.

 Let me list words ending with ""A_ER"" (so positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R) and positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

 Other words:
   - BAKER: B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - DATER: D at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - FAKER: F at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - GAMER: G at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - LAGER: L at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - MAKER: M at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - PAGER: P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - RAPER: R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would have two R's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates. However, we have R at position 5 and if we put R at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. Also, in the feedback for ""taser"", we had R at position 5 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates. So RAPER is a valid word? But we have to consider that if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known to be in the word in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we know R is in the word at position 5, but it might be the only R. So if we put R at position 1, and the word has only one R (at position 5), then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent (x). But we are trying to find the word, so we can use that to test.

 However, we have limited guesses. We might want to avoid using known letters in new positions because we already know they are in the word? But we don't know if they appear again.

 Alternatively, we can use two new letters to maximize information.

 Since we have two positions, we can try a word that uses two common letters that haven't been tested.

 Let me choose ""BAKER"": 
   B and K are new. If we get feedback, we will know about B and K.

 But note: we have other possibilities. We might get it right.

 However, we are not sure. We can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"", but T is excluded. Or ""LATER"", but T is excluded.

 Since T is excluded, we can remove any word that has T.

 Similarly, S is excluded.

 So the word cannot have T or S.

 Now, let's list the words that fit the pattern and don't have T, S, C, N:

   BALER, BAKER, FAKER, GAMER, LAGER, MAKER, PAGER, RAPER, WAFER, HAVER, etc.

 But we must choose one that is valid.

 We can choose ""BAKER"" to test B and K.

 But note: if we guess ""BAKER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

 However, we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess. We have 4 more after this.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to cover more possibilities.

 But note: we have many words to choose from. We might also consider that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

 I think ""BAKER"" is a good choice.

 But let me see: if we guess ""BAKER"", and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B -> if it's correct, we get ✓, else if it's present but wrong position we get -, else x.
   Position 3: K -> similarly.

 However, if we get both wrong, we know that the word is one of the others (like FAKER, MAKER, etc.) but without knowing which letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that appear in multiple possibilities, so that we can eliminate more.

 For example, if we choose ""PAGER"", we test P and G. But note that ""PAGER"" has P and G, which are not in ""BAKER"" or ""MAKER"". So if we get P and G wrong, then we know the word must be one that doesn't have P or G, like ""BAKER"", ""MAKER"", ""FAKER"", etc.

 But we don't have a word that covers two very common letters that appear in many of these options.

 Notice that in the list, the letters at position 1 and 3 are:

   Position 1: B, F, G, L, M, P, W, H, ... 
   Position 3: K, G, M, L, P, V, ...

 The letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER (but WAKER is a word? Yes, but we have to check if it's accepted). Similarly, G appears in GAMER, LAGER, PAGER.

 So if we choose a word that has K at position 3, we cover several possibilities.

 How about ""MAKER"": M at 1 and K at 3. Then if we get M and K correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

 But we don't know if M is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are not in the other possibilities? That might not be efficient.

 Since we have two unknowns, we can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"" but T is excluded, so no.

 Another idea: we know from the first guess that the word has no C, N, and now we know no T, S. Also, we have A, E, R fixed.

 The first guess ""crane"" had the letter 'A' at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at position 2 and it's correct. So that is consistent.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and now we have it at position 5. And E was at 5 and now at 4.

 Now, we need to fill the first and third positions.

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   ""WATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""HATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""MAKER"" -> possible.

 But note: we have ""BAKER"", which is also common.

 Since we are not sure, and we have to choose one, I'll go with ""BAKER"" because it uses B and K, which are common.

 But wait, we have not tested B and K at all.

 So let's guess ""BAKER"".

 If the feedback for ""BAKER"" is:
   B: if it's at position 1 and correct, then ✓. If not, then we know it's not B at 1.
   Similarly for K at 3.

 And if both are correct, we win.

 If not, we narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that are in many of the possibilities? For example, the letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER. So if we test a word that has K at position 3, we can confirm if K is at position 3.

 But we can do that by guessing ""BAKER"", which has K at 3.

 If we guess ""BAKER"" and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B is either ✓ or x (or even - if it's in the word but not at 1? But we don't have any B in the word so far, so if it's present, it would be at position 1? Actually, if B is in the word but not at 1, then we get a '-'. Similarly for K.

 But note: we have only two positions open. So if B is not at 1, then it must be at position 3? But we have position 3 as K. So if B is in the word, it must be at position 3? But we are putting B at 1 and K at 3. So if the word has B at position 3, then we would get:
   Position 1: B -> x (because it's not at 1) or - (if it's in the word but at position 3). But we are putting K at position 3, so if the word has B at 3, then K would be wrong? 

 This might be confusing.

 Let me clarify: the word has fixed positions 2,4,5: A, E, R.
 The word has two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] E R

 We are guessing ""BAKER"": which is B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 The feedback will tell us:
   For B: 
        if the word has B at position 1: ✓
        if the word has B but not at 1: then it must be at position 3? But we are putting K at 3. So if the word has B at 3, then we would get for B: - (because it's in the word but at position 3? But we are putting B at 1, so if the word has B at 3, then the B at 1 is not present, so we get a '-' for B? Actually, no: the feedback for B would be '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. And then for K at position 3: we would get an 'x' because the word has B at 3, not K.

   Similarly, if the word has K at position 1, then we would get for B: x (if K is at 1, then B is not in the word) and for K: - (because K is in the word but not at position 3, but at position 1? But we are putting K at 3, so if K is at 1, then at position 3 we have a different letter. So we get for K: - and for B: x.

 But note: the word can only have one letter at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the possibilities are:

   If we get:
      B: ✓ and K: ✓ -> the word is BAKER.

      B: ✓ and K: x -> then the word is BA?ER, but the third letter is not K. So it could be BALER, BAMER? (but BAMER is not a word), or BAPER? (not common). Actually, common words: BALER, or maybe BADER? (not common). So if B is at 1 and K is not at 3, then we know the third letter is not K, and we have to try another.

      B: x and K: ✓ -> then the word is ?AKER, with the first letter not B. So it could be FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

      B: - and K: x -> this would mean B is in the word but not at 1, and K is not in the word. Since B is in the word but not at 1, it must be at position 3? But we have K at 3, so if B is at 3, then K is not. So the word would be ?ABER. But we have to check if that's a word: ""AB"" at positions 2 and 3? The word would be [letter] A B E R. Words: CABER? but C is excluded. TABER? T excluded. So probably not. Or maybe the word has B at position 3 and the first letter is something else. But then the word is [letter] A B E R. Is that a word? ""SABER"" -> S excluded. ""DABER"" -> not a word. So this case might not happen.

      Similarly, B: x and K: - -> meaning K is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at position 1? Then the word is K A ? E R. Words: KAPER? (which is a word, meaning one who kapes? not common). Or KAVER? not a word. So this case is unlikely.

      B: - and K: - -> meaning B is in the word but not at 1, and K is in the word but not at 3. Then the word must have B and K, but at which positions? The only positions are 1 and 3, but we are getting - for both, meaning they are in the word but not at the guessed positions. So B must be at 3 and K must be at 1? But then the word would be K A B E R -> ""KABER"" which is not a word. Or if the word has more than one of a letter? But we have only two positions. So this case is also unlikely.

 Therefore, the most likely outcomes are:
   - Both correct: we win.
   - B correct and K wrong: then the word is BALER (since B at 1 and the third letter is L) or maybe BADER? but not common. Or BAKER is the only common one with B at 1 and K at 3? But we are getting K wrong, so it must be a different letter at 3. So then we have to consider BALER, or perhaps other words like BAAED? not matching pattern.

   - B wrong and K correct: then the word is FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

   - Both wrong: then the word is not BAKER and doesn't have B or K? Then it could be GAMER, LAGER, PAGER, etc.

 So we can get a lot of information.

 But note: we have only two positions and we are testing two letters. It's efficient.

 Therefore, I will guess ""BAKER"".

 However, let me check if ""BAKER"" is a valid word in Wordle. Yes, it is.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).
- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must match the pattern `_ A _ E R`.
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with new letters (not C, N, T, S).
- Common letters to test: **B**, **K**, **L**, **M**, **P**, **G** (high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out).
- A strong candidate is **""baker""**:
  - Tests **B** at position 1 and **K** at position 3.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if B is correct but K is wrong, consider ""baler""; if K is correct but B is wrong, consider ""faker"" or ""maker"").",Guess 3: baker -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  1: C
  2: R
  3: A
  4: N
  5: E

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - R is not at position 2.
 - A is not at position 3.
 - E is not at position 5.

 Also, we must avoid using C and N in future guesses.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 - Does not contain C or N.
 - Contains R, A, and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 - We can also include other common letters to test.

 Since R, A, and E are in the word, we have three letters we know are present. We can try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has R, A, E and two new letters (avoiding C and N). Also, we want to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, and 5 respectively.

 Possible positions for:
   R: can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know the word length is 5, so all positions except 2. However, we must avoid the positions where they were marked as absent? Actually, the feedback only tells us that they are not in the position we guessed. So R cannot be at position 2, but it can be at 1,3,4,5.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1,2,4,5.
 E cannot be at position 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

 We also want to test other common letters. Since we have three known letters, we can try to use two new letters that are common (like T, S, L, etc.).

 Let's try to form a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters.

 Example words:
 - ""LATER"": contains L, A, T, E, R -> but note: we have A and E and R. Also, we avoid C and N. However, let's check the positions:
   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   For A: position 2 (was not position 3 in the first guess, so allowed) -> but we don't know if it's correct until we get feedback.
   For E: position 4 (was not position 5, so allowed).
   For R: position 5 (was not position 2, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if T and L are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests two new letters (T and L) and places the known letters in new positions.

 Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word? I think it's accepted in Wordle, meaning a financial term). But let's stick to common words.

 Alternatively, ""STARE"": S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> wait, A is at position 3? But in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and E at position 5.

 So ""STARE"" has A at position 3? That's the same as the first guess. We know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

 Let's try ""STARE"" with different arrangement? Actually, we can rearrange the known letters.

 How about ""RATES"": 
   R at 1 -> but we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 1. However, we are allowed to try. But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong. Now we put it at position 1. Also, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the previous positions: 
   R: was at 2, now at 1 -> new position.
   A: was at 3, now at 2 -> new position.
   E: was at 5, now at 4 -> new position.

 And we test T and S.

 Another candidate: ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we should avoid that.

 So ""RAISE"" is not good because E is at position 5.

 How about ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we know it's not there. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid.

 We want to maximize information. So we should avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Let me try to list words that have R, A, E and two new letters, and place R not at 2, A not at 3, E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: R? Then A and E can be at 2,3,4,5 but avoiding A at 3 and E at 5.
   Example: R at 1, A at 2 (allowed because A was at 3, not 2), then E at 4 (avoiding 5). Then we need two more letters. Let's put T and S: ""RATES"" as above.

   Or: R at 1, A at 4, E at 2: ""R_ _ A E"" -> but we need a word. ""RIPAE""? Not a word. ""RUSAE""? Not common.

   Another: without R at 1? Let A be at 1: then R can be at 3,4,5 (avoiding 2) and E at 2,3,4 (avoiding 5). Example: ""A__ R E"" but we need two more letters. ""AERIE""? That has two E's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, ""AERIE"" has E at position 5? No: A(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), E(5) -> E at 5 is not allowed.

   How about ""ALERT"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
        A: position 1 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
        E: position 3 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
        R: position 4 (was 2, so new) -> allowed.
        And we test L and T.

   This seems good.

   Another: ""ALTER"": 
        A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
        A: position 1 -> new.
        E: position 4 -> new (avoiding 5).
        R: position 5 -> new (avoiding 2).

   Also good.

 But note: we have three known letters (R, A, E) and we are including two new ones (L, T). We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common consonants. S and T are very common.

 Let me consider ""RATES"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.
   This uses S and T, which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S or T. But that's the point of guessing.

 Another candidate: ""TASER"": 
   T at 1, A at 2, S at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   This also uses S and T.

 However, in ""TASER"", A is at position 2 and R at position 5. We don't have any conflict with the previous forbidden positions.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5, which is allowed. Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, which is allowed. E was at 5 and now at 4, which is allowed.

 So both ""RATES"" and ""TASER"" are good.

 I think ""TASER"" is a common word.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 Let me choose ""TASER"" because it starts with T (another common letter) and we haven't tested T and S.

 So my second guess: TASER

 But let me check: we are avoiding C and N, and we are including R, A, E (which we know are in the word) and T and S (which we don't know).

 This should be a good guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARE"" but we have to rearrange to avoid A at 3 and E at 5. We can do ""STARE"" as S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A at 3 is the same as the first guess? We know A is not at 3, so that would be a waste. So we avoid.

 How about ""SALET""? 
   S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)
   A: at 2 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.
   E: at 4 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.
   But we don't have R? We know R is in the word, so we must include R. Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R, A, and E.

 Therefore, ""TASER"" is a good choice.

 Let me go with ""TASER"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Avoids **C** and **N** (since they are absent).
3. Places R, A, and E in new positions (not 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
4. Tests new common letters like **T** and **S** for efficiency.

A strong candidate is **""taser""**:
- **T** at position 1 (new letter).
- **A** at position 2 (previously at 3, now a new position).
- **S** at position 3 (new letter).
- **E** at position 4 (previously at 5, now a new position).
- **R** at position 5 (previously at 2, now a new position).

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (T and S) to gather more information.

<guess>taser</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: taser -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""taser"":
 T: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

 From this, we know:
 - T and S are not in the word.
 - A, E, and R are in the word and in the correct positions: 
      A is at position 2, 
      E is at position 4, 
      R is at position 5.

 Also, from the first guess, we knew that C and N are not in the word.

 Now, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:
   Position 2: A
   Position 4: E
   Position 5: R

 And we know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

 We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we now have placed) and no other letters from ""crane"" except these. But note: the first guess had R, A, E as present but in wrong positions, but now we have them in correct positions.

 The secret word pattern so far: _ A _ E R

 We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3.

 We know the letters that are not in the word: C, N, T, S.

 We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E R and uses only letters that are not excluded.

 Also, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 3.

 We have not tested many letters yet. We can try to use common letters that haven't been excluded.

 Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

 Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can use a word that might give us more information if we don't get it right.

 However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 letters already correct and in place. So we are in a good position.

 We can try to guess a word that has the form _ A _ E R and uses two new letters to test.

 But note: if we guess a word that has one of the unknown letters correct, we might get it right or get partial information.

 Since we have two blanks, we can also consider that the same letter might appear in both? But we don't have any duplicate letters so far.

 Let me think of words that match the pattern: ?A?ER

 Some possibilities:
   - BALER: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word (a person who bales)
   - HATER: but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - PAPER: P at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two P's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But note: the feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we haven't tested P. But wait, in ""paper"", the first P and the second P: if the word has only one P, then one of them would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, T and S are excluded, so HATER is out because of T.

 Let me list words ending with ""A_ER"" (so positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R) and positions 1 and 3 are unknown.

 Other words:
   - BAKER: B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - DATER: D at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - FAKER: F at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - GAMER: G at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - LAGER: L at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - MAKER: M at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - PAGER: P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid
   - RAPER: R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would have two R's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn't mean the secret word can't have duplicates. However, we have R at position 5 and if we put R at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. Also, in the feedback for ""taser"", we had R at position 5 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about duplicates. So RAPER is a valid word? But we have to consider that if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we don't know. However, to be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known to be in the word in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we know R is in the word at position 5, but it might be the only R. So if we put R at position 1, and the word has only one R (at position 5), then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent (x). But we are trying to find the word, so we can use that to test.

 However, we have limited guesses. We might want to avoid using known letters in new positions because we already know they are in the word? But we don't know if they appear again.

 Alternatively, we can use two new letters to maximize information.

 Since we have two positions, we can try a word that uses two common letters that haven't been tested.

 Let me choose ""BAKER"": 
   B and K are new. If we get feedback, we will know about B and K.

 But note: we have other possibilities. We might get it right.

 However, we are not sure. We can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"", but T is excluded. Or ""LATER"", but T is excluded.

 Since T is excluded, we can remove any word that has T.

 Similarly, S is excluded.

 So the word cannot have T or S.

 Now, let's list the words that fit the pattern and don't have T, S, C, N:

   BALER, BAKER, FAKER, GAMER, LAGER, MAKER, PAGER, RAPER, WAFER, HAVER, etc.

 But we must choose one that is valid.

 We can choose ""BAKER"" to test B and K.

 But note: if we guess ""BAKER"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

 However, we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess. We have 4 more after this.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to cover more possibilities.

 But note: we have many words to choose from. We might also consider that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

 I think ""BAKER"" is a good choice.

 But let me see: if we guess ""BAKER"", and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B -> if it's correct, we get ✓, else if it's present but wrong position we get -, else x.
   Position 3: K -> similarly.

 However, if we get both wrong, we know that the word is one of the others (like FAKER, MAKER, etc.) but without knowing which letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that appear in multiple possibilities, so that we can eliminate more.

 For example, if we choose ""PAGER"", we test P and G. But note that ""PAGER"" has P and G, which are not in ""BAKER"" or ""MAKER"". So if we get P and G wrong, then we know the word must be one that doesn't have P or G, like ""BAKER"", ""MAKER"", ""FAKER"", etc.

 But we don't have a word that covers two very common letters that appear in many of these options.

 Notice that in the list, the letters at position 1 and 3 are:

   Position 1: B, F, G, L, M, P, W, H, ... 
   Position 3: K, G, M, L, P, V, ...

 The letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER (but WAKER is a word? Yes, but we have to check if it's accepted). Similarly, G appears in GAMER, LAGER, PAGER.

 So if we choose a word that has K at position 3, we cover several possibilities.

 How about ""MAKER"": M at 1 and K at 3. Then if we get M and K correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

 But we don't know if M is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are not in the other possibilities? That might not be efficient.

 Since we have two unknowns, we can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"" but T is excluded, so no.

 Another idea: we know from the first guess that the word has no C, N, and now we know no T, S. Also, we have A, E, R fixed.

 The first guess ""crane"" had the letter 'A' at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at position 2 and it's correct. So that is consistent.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and now we have it at position 5. And E was at 5 and now at 4.

 Now, we need to fill the first and third positions.

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but T is excluded -> invalid.
   ""WATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""HATER"" -> T excluded.
   ""MAKER"" -> possible.

 But note: we have ""BAKER"", which is also common.

 Since we are not sure, and we have to choose one, I'll go with ""BAKER"" because it uses B and K, which are common.

 But wait, we have not tested B and K at all.

 So let's guess ""BAKER"".

 If the feedback for ""BAKER"" is:
   B: if it's at position 1 and correct, then ✓. If not, then we know it's not B at 1.
   Similarly for K at 3.

 And if both are correct, we win.

 If not, we narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that are in many of the possibilities? For example, the letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER. So if we test a word that has K at position 3, we can confirm if K is at position 3.

 But we can do that by guessing ""BAKER"", which has K at 3.

 If we guess ""BAKER"" and the feedback shows:
   Position 1: B is either ✓ or x (or even - if it's in the word but not at 1? But we don't have any B in the word so far, so if it's present, it would be at position 1? Actually, if B is in the word but not at 1, then we get a '-'. Similarly for K.

 But note: we have only two positions open. So if B is not at 1, then it must be at position 3? But we have position 3 as K. So if B is in the word, it must be at position 3? But we are putting B at 1 and K at 3. So if the word has B at position 3, then we would get:
   Position 1: B -> x (because it's not at 1) or - (if it's in the word but at position 3). But we are putting K at position 3, so if the word has B at 3, then K would be wrong? 

 This might be confusing.

 Let me clarify: the word has fixed positions 2,4,5: A, E, R.
 The word has two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] E R

 We are guessing ""BAKER"": which is B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 The feedback will tell us:
   For B: 
        if the word has B at position 1: ✓
        if the word has B but not at 1: then it must be at position 3? But we are putting K at 3. So if the word has B at 3, then we would get for B: - (because it's in the word but at position 3? But we are putting B at 1, so if the word has B at 3, then the B at 1 is not present, so we get a '-' for B? Actually, no: the feedback for B would be '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. And then for K at position 3: we would get an 'x' because the word has B at 3, not K.

   Similarly, if the word has K at position 1, then we would get for B: x (if K is at 1, then B is not in the word) and for K: - (because K is in the word but not at position 3, but at position 1? But we are putting K at 3, so if K is at 1, then at position 3 we have a different letter. So we get for K: - and for B: x.

 But note: the word can only have one letter at position 1 and one at position 3.

 So the possibilities are:

   If we get:
      B: ✓ and K: ✓ -> the word is BAKER.

      B: ✓ and K: x -> then the word is BA?ER, but the third letter is not K. So it could be BALER, BAMER? (but BAMER is not a word), or BAPER? (not common). Actually, common words: BALER, or maybe BADER? (not common). So if B is at 1 and K is not at 3, then we know the third letter is not K, and we have to try another.

      B: x and K: ✓ -> then the word is ?AKER, with the first letter not B. So it could be FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

      B: - and K: x -> this would mean B is in the word but not at 1, and K is not in the word. Since B is in the word but not at 1, it must be at position 3? But we have K at 3, so if B is at 3, then K is not. So the word would be ?ABER. But we have to check if that's a word: ""AB"" at positions 2 and 3? The word would be [letter] A B E R. Words: CABER? but C is excluded. TABER? T excluded. So probably not. Or maybe the word has B at position 3 and the first letter is something else. But then the word is [letter] A B E R. Is that a word? ""SABER"" -> S excluded. ""DABER"" -> not a word. So this case might not happen.

      Similarly, B: x and K: - -> meaning K is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at position 1? Then the word is K A ? E R. Words: KAPER? (which is a word, meaning one who kapes? not common). Or KAVER? not a word. So this case is unlikely.

      B: - and K: - -> meaning B is in the word but not at 1, and K is in the word but not at 3. Then the word must have B and K, but at which positions? The only positions are 1 and 3, but we are getting - for both, meaning they are in the word but not at the guessed positions. So B must be at 3 and K must be at 1? But then the word would be K A B E R -> ""KABER"" which is not a word. Or if the word has more than one of a letter? But we have only two positions. So this case is also unlikely.

 Therefore, the most likely outcomes are:
   - Both correct: we win.
   - B correct and K wrong: then the word is BALER (since B at 1 and the third letter is L) or maybe BADER? but not common. Or BAKER is the only common one with B at 1 and K at 3? But we are getting K wrong, so it must be a different letter at 3. So then we have to consider BALER, or perhaps other words like BAAED? not matching pattern.

   - B wrong and K correct: then the word is FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.

   - Both wrong: then the word is not BAKER and doesn't have B or K? Then it could be GAMER, LAGER, PAGER, etc.

 So we can get a lot of information.

 But note: we have only two positions and we are testing two letters. It's efficient.

 Therefore, I will guess ""BAKER"".

 However, let me check if ""BAKER"" is a valid word in Wordle. Yes, it is.

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).
- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must match the pattern `_ A _ E R`.
- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with new letters (not C, N, T, S).
- Common letters to test: **B**, **K**, **L**, **M**, **P**, **G** (high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out).
- A strong candidate is **""baker""**:
  - Tests **B** at position 1 and **K** at position 3.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., if B is correct but K is wrong, consider ""baler""; if K is correct but B is wrong, consider ""faker"" or ""maker"").

We should choose a word that:\n - Does not contain C or N.\n - Contains R, A, and E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n - We can also include other common letters to test.\n\n Since R, A, and E are in the word, we have three letters we know are present. We can try to place them in new positions.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R, A, E and two new letters (avoiding C and N). Also, we want to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, and 5 respectively.\n\n Possible positions for:\n   R: can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don\'t know the word length is 5, so all positions except 2. However, we must avoid the positions where they were marked as absent? Actually, the feedback only tells us that they are not in the position we guessed. So R cannot be at position 2, but it can be at 1,3,4,5.\n\n Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1,2,4,5.\n E cannot be at position 5, so it can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\n We also want to test other common letters. Since we have three known letters, we can try to use two new letters that are common (like T, S, L, etc.).\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes R, A, E and two new letters.\n\n Example words:\n - ""LATER"": contains L, A, T, E, R -> but note: we have A and E and R. Also, we avoid C and N. However, let\'s check the positions:\n   L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   For A: position 2 (was not position 3 in the first guess, so allowed) -> but we don\'t know if it\'s correct until we get feedback.\n   For E: position 4 (was not position 5, so allowed).\n   For R: position 5 (was not position 2, so allowed).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T and L are in the word. This is a good candidate because it tests two new letters (T and L) and places the known letters in new positions.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word? I think it\'s accepted in Wordle, meaning a financial term). But let\'s stick to common words.\n\n Alternatively, ""STARE"": S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> wait, A is at position 3? But in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at that position. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n Similarly, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and E at position 5.\n\n So ""STARE"" has A at position 3? That\'s the same as the first guess. We know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.\n\n Let\'s try ""STARE"" with different arrangement? Actually, we can rearrange the known letters.\n\n How about ""RATES"": \n   R at 1 -> but we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s at position 1. However, we are allowed to try. But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong. Now we put it at position 1. Also, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n This avoids the previous positions: \n   R: was at 2, now at 1 -> new position.\n   A: was at 3, now at 2 -> new position.\n   E: was at 5, now at 4 -> new position.\n\n And we test T and S.\n\n Another candidate: ""RAISE"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? We know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we should avoid that.\n\n So ""RAISE"" is not good because E is at position 5.\n\n How about ""ARISE"": \n   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was at position 2 in the first guess and we know it\'s not there. So we cannot put R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid.\n\n We want to maximize information. So we should avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\n Let me try to list words that have R, A, E and two new letters, and place R not at 2, A not at 3, E not at 5.\n\n Possibilities:\n   Position 1: R? Then A and E can be at 2,3,4,5 but avoiding A at 3 and E at 5.\n   Example: R at 1, A at 2 (allowed because A was at 3, not 2), then E at 4 (avoiding 5). Then we need two more letters. Let\'s put T and S: ""RATES"" as above.\n\n   Or: R at 1, A at 4, E at 2: ""R_ _ A E"" -> but we need a word. ""RIPAE""? Not a word. ""RUSAE""? Not common.\n\n   Another: without R at 1? Let A be at 1: then R can be at 3,4,5 (avoiding 2) and E at 2,3,4 (avoiding 5). Example: ""A__ R E"" but we need two more letters. ""AERIE""? That has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, ""AERIE"" has E at position 5? No: A(1), E(2), R(3), I(4), E(5) -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n   How about ""ALERT"": \n        A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n        A: position 1 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.\n        E: position 3 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.\n        R: position 4 (was 2, so new) -> allowed.\n        And we test L and T.\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   Another: ""ALTER"": \n        A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n        A: position 1 -> new.\n        E: position 4 -> new (avoiding 5).\n        R: position 5 -> new (avoiding 2).\n\n   Also good.\n\n But note: we have three known letters (R, A, E) and we are including two new ones (L, T). We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has more common consonants. S and T are very common.\n\n Let me consider ""RATES"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n   This uses S and T, which are common.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S or T. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\n Another candidate: ""TASER"": \n   T at 1, A at 2, S at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   This also uses S and T.\n\n However, in ""TASER"", A is at position 2 and R at position 5. We don\'t have any conflict with the previous forbidden positions.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5, which is allowed. Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, which is allowed. E was at 5 and now at 4, which is allowed.\n\n So both ""RATES"" and ""TASER"" are good.\n\n I think ""TASER"" is a common word.\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n Let me choose ""TASER"" because it starts with T (another common letter) and we haven\'t tested T and S.\n\n So my second guess: TASER\n\n But let me check: we are avoiding C and N, and we are including R, A, E (which we know are in the word) and T and S (which we don\'t know).\n\n This should be a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""STARE"" but we have to rearrange to avoid A at 3 and E at 5. We can do ""STARE"" as S(1), T(2), A(3) -> but A at 3 is the same as the first guess? We know A is not at 3, so that would be a waste. So we avoid.\n\n How about ""SALET""? \n   S(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n   A: at 2 (was 3, so new) -> allowed.\n   E: at 4 (was 5, so new) -> allowed.\n   But we don\'t have R? We know R is in the word, so we must include R. Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.\n\n So we must include R, A, and E.\n\n Therefore, ""TASER"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me go with ""TASER"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:\n  - R cannot be at position 2.\n  - A cannot be at position 3.\n  - E cannot be at position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes **R**, **A**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Avoids **C** and **N** (since they are absent).\n3. Places R, A, and E in new positions (not 2, 3, and 5 respectively).\n4. Tests new common letters like **T** and **S** for efficiency.\n\nA strong candidate is **""taser""**:\n- **T** at position 1 (new letter).\n- **A** at position 2 (previously at 3, now a new position).\n- **S** at position 3 (new letter).\n- **E** at position 4 (previously at 5, now a new position).\n- **R** at position 5 (previously at 2, now a new position).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the known letters in fresh positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (T and S) to gather more information.\n\n<guess>taser</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: taser -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) S(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""taser"":\n T: x (not in the word)\n A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)\n S: x (not in the word)\n E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)\n R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)\n\n From this, we know:\n - T and S are not in the word.\n - A, E, and R are in the word and in the correct positions: \n      A is at position 2, \n      E is at position 4, \n      R is at position 5.\n\n Also, from the first guess, we knew that C and N are not in the word.\n\n Now, the secret word has the following known letters in fixed positions:\n   Position 2: A\n   Position 4: E\n   Position 5: R\n\n And we know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\n We also know from the first guess that the word contains R, A, E (which we now have placed) and no other letters from ""crane"" except these. But note: the first guess had R, A, E as present but in wrong positions, but now we have them in correct positions.\n\n The secret word pattern so far: _ A _ E R\n\n We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3.\n\n We know the letters that are not in the word: C, N, T, S.\n\n We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E R and uses only letters that are not excluded.\n\n Also, we must remember that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list possible letters for position 1 and 3.\n\n We have not tested many letters yet. We can try to use common letters that haven\'t been excluded.\n\n Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.\n\n Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can use a word that might give us more information if we don\'t get it right.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We have 3 letters already correct and in place. So we are in a good position.\n\n We can try to guess a word that has the form _ A _ E R and uses two new letters to test.\n\n But note: if we guess a word that has one of the unknown letters correct, we might get it right or get partial information.\n\n Since we have two blanks, we can also consider that the same letter might appear in both? But we don\'t have any duplicate letters so far.\n\n Let me think of words that match the pattern: ?A?ER\n\n Some possibilities:\n   - BALER: B at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid word (a person who bales)\n   - HATER: but T is excluded -> invalid.\n   - PAPER: P at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two P\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But note: the feedback so far doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but it\'s possible. However, we haven\'t tested P. But wait, in ""paper"", the first P and the second P: if the word has only one P, then one of them would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. However, T and S are excluded, so HATER is out because of T.\n\n Let me list words ending with ""A_ER"" (so positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R) and positions 1 and 3 are unknown.\n\n Other words:\n   - BAKER: B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - DATER: D at 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n   - FAKER: F at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - GAMER: G at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - LAGER: L at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - MAKER: M at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - PAGER: P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid\n   - RAPER: R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would have two R\'s. And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicates, but that doesn\'t mean the secret word can\'t have duplicates. However, we have R at position 5 and if we put R at position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we don\'t have any feedback about duplicates. Also, in the feedback for ""taser"", we had R at position 5 and it was correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. So RAPER is a valid word? But we have to consider that if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known to be in the word in positions we haven\'t tested? Actually, we know R is in the word at position 5, but it might be the only R. So if we put R at position 1, and the word has only one R (at position 5), then the R at position 1 would be marked as absent (x). But we are trying to find the word, so we can use that to test.\n\n However, we have limited guesses. We might want to avoid using known letters in new positions because we already know they are in the word? But we don\'t know if they appear again.\n\n Alternatively, we can use two new letters to maximize information.\n\n Since we have two positions, we can try a word that uses two common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\n Let me choose ""BAKER"": \n   B and K are new. If we get feedback, we will know about B and K.\n\n But note: we have other possibilities. We might get it right.\n\n However, we are not sure. We can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"", but T is excluded. Or ""LATER"", but T is excluded.\n\n Since T is excluded, we can remove any word that has T.\n\n Similarly, S is excluded.\n\n So the word cannot have T or S.\n\n Now, let\'s list the words that fit the pattern and don\'t have T, S, C, N:\n\n   BALER, BAKER, FAKER, GAMER, LAGER, MAKER, PAGER, RAPER, WAFER, HAVER, etc.\n\n But we must choose one that is valid.\n\n We can choose ""BAKER"" to test B and K.\n\n But note: if we guess ""BAKER"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B and K.\n\n However, we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess. We have 4 more after this.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two different letters to cover more possibilities.\n\n But note: we have many words to choose from. We might also consider that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.\n\n I think ""BAKER"" is a good choice.\n\n But let me see: if we guess ""BAKER"", and the feedback shows:\n   Position 1: B -> if it\'s correct, we get ✓, else if it\'s present but wrong position we get -, else x.\n   Position 3: K -> similarly.\n\n However, if we get both wrong, we know that the word is one of the others (like FAKER, MAKER, etc.) but without knowing which letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that appear in multiple possibilities, so that we can eliminate more.\n\n For example, if we choose ""PAGER"", we test P and G. But note that ""PAGER"" has P and G, which are not in ""BAKER"" or ""MAKER"". So if we get P and G wrong, then we know the word must be one that doesn\'t have P or G, like ""BAKER"", ""MAKER"", ""FAKER"", etc.\n\n But we don\'t have a word that covers two very common letters that appear in many of these options.\n\n Notice that in the list, the letters at position 1 and 3 are:\n\n   Position 1: B, F, G, L, M, P, W, H, ... \n   Position 3: K, G, M, L, P, V, ...\n\n The letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER (but WAKER is a word? Yes, but we have to check if it\'s accepted). Similarly, G appears in GAMER, LAGER, PAGER.\n\n So if we choose a word that has K at position 3, we cover several possibilities.\n\n How about ""MAKER"": M at 1 and K at 3. Then if we get M and K correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.\n\n But we don\'t know if M is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters that are not in the other possibilities? That might not be efficient.\n\n Since we have two unknowns, we can also consider that the word might be ""WATER"" but T is excluded, so no.\n\n Another idea: we know from the first guess that the word has no C, N, and now we know no T, S. Also, we have A, E, R fixed.\n\n The first guess ""crane"" had the letter \'A\' at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at position 2 and it\'s correct. So that is consistent.\n\n Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and now we have it at position 5. And E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n Now, we need to fill the first and third positions.\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""LATER"" -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n   ""WATER"" -> T excluded.\n   ""HATER"" -> T excluded.\n   ""MAKER"" -> possible.\n\n But note: we have ""BAKER"", which is also common.\n\n Since we are not sure, and we have to choose one, I\'ll go with ""BAKER"" because it uses B and K, which are common.\n\n But wait, we have not tested B and K at all.\n\n So let\'s guess ""BAKER"".\n\n If the feedback for ""BAKER"" is:\n   B: if it\'s at position 1 and correct, then ✓. If not, then we know it\'s not B at 1.\n   Similarly for K at 3.\n\n And if both are correct, we win.\n\n If not, we narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that are in many of the possibilities? For example, the letter K appears in BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, WAKER. So if we test a word that has K at position 3, we can confirm if K is at position 3.\n\n But we can do that by guessing ""BAKER"", which has K at 3.\n\n If we guess ""BAKER"" and the feedback shows:\n   Position 1: B is either ✓ or x (or even - if it\'s in the word but not at 1? But we don\'t have any B in the word so far, so if it\'s present, it would be at position 1? Actually, if B is in the word but not at 1, then we get a \'-\'. Similarly for K.\n\n But note: we have only two positions open. So if B is not at 1, then it must be at position 3? But we have position 3 as K. So if B is in the word, it must be at position 3? But we are putting B at 1 and K at 3. So if the word has B at position 3, then we would get:\n   Position 1: B -> x (because it\'s not at 1) or - (if it\'s in the word but at position 3). But we are putting K at position 3, so if the word has B at 3, then K would be wrong? \n\n This might be confusing.\n\n Let me clarify: the word has fixed positions 2,4,5: A, E, R.\n The word has two more letters: one at position 1 and one at position 3.\n\n So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] E R\n\n We are guessing ""BAKER"": which is B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n The feedback will tell us:\n   For B: \n        if the word has B at position 1: ✓\n        if the word has B but not at 1: then it must be at position 3? But we are putting K at 3. So if the word has B at 3, then we would get for B: - (because it\'s in the word but at position 3? But we are putting B at 1, so if the word has B at 3, then the B at 1 is not present, so we get a \'-\' for B? Actually, no: the feedback for B would be \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1. And then for K at position 3: we would get an \'x\' because the word has B at 3, not K.\n\n   Similarly, if the word has K at position 1, then we would get for B: x (if K is at 1, then B is not in the word) and for K: - (because K is in the word but not at position 3, but at position 1? But we are putting K at 3, so if K is at 1, then at position 3 we have a different letter. So we get for K: - and for B: x.\n\n But note: the word can only have one letter at position 1 and one at position 3.\n\n So the possibilities are:\n\n   If we get:\n      B: ✓ and K: ✓ -> the word is BAKER.\n\n      B: ✓ and K: x -> then the word is BA?ER, but the third letter is not K. So it could be BALER, BAMER? (but BAMER is not a word), or BAPER? (not common). Actually, common words: BALER, or maybe BADER? (not common). So if B is at 1 and K is not at 3, then we know the third letter is not K, and we have to try another.\n\n      B: x and K: ✓ -> then the word is ?AKER, with the first letter not B. So it could be FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.\n\n      B: - and K: x -> this would mean B is in the word but not at 1, and K is not in the word. Since B is in the word but not at 1, it must be at position 3? But we have K at 3, so if B is at 3, then K is not. So the word would be ?ABER. But we have to check if that\'s a word: ""AB"" at positions 2 and 3? The word would be [letter] A B E R. Words: CABER? but C is excluded. TABER? T excluded. So probably not. Or maybe the word has B at position 3 and the first letter is something else. But then the word is [letter] A B E R. Is that a word? ""SABER"" -> S excluded. ""DABER"" -> not a word. So this case might not happen.\n\n      Similarly, B: x and K: - -> meaning K is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at position 1? Then the word is K A ? E R. Words: KAPER? (which is a word, meaning one who kapes? not common). Or KAVER? not a word. So this case is unlikely.\n\n      B: - and K: - -> meaning B is in the word but not at 1, and K is in the word but not at 3. Then the word must have B and K, but at which positions? The only positions are 1 and 3, but we are getting - for both, meaning they are in the word but not at the guessed positions. So B must be at 3 and K must be at 1? But then the word would be K A B E R -> ""KABER"" which is not a word. Or if the word has more than one of a letter? But we have only two positions. So this case is also unlikely.\n\n Therefore, the most likely outcomes are:\n   - Both correct: we win.\n   - B correct and K wrong: then the word is BALER (since B at 1 and the third letter is L) or maybe BADER? but not common. Or BAKER is the only common one with B at 1 and K at 3? But we are getting K wrong, so it must be a different letter at 3. So then we have to consider BALER, or perhaps other words like BAAED? not matching pattern.\n\n   - B wrong and K correct: then the word is FAKER, MAKER, WAKER, etc.\n\n   - Both wrong: then the word is not BAKER and doesn\'t have B or K? Then it could be GAMER, LAGER, PAGER, etc.\n\n So we can get a lot of information.\n\n But note: we have only two positions and we are testing two letters. It\'s efficient.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""BAKER"".\n\n However, let me check if ""BAKER"" is a valid word in Wordle. Yes, it is.\n\n So let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).\n- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed positions**: \n  - Position 2: A\n  - Position 4: E\n  - Position 5: R\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The secret word must match the pattern `_ A _ E R`.\n- We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with new letters (not C, N, T, S).\n- Common letters to test: **B**, **K**, **L**, **M**, **P**, **G** (high-frequency consonants not yet ruled out).\n- A strong candidate is **""baker""**:\n  - Tests **B** at position 1 and **K** at position 3.\n  - If correct, we solve the word.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""baker"":
 B: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)
 K: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

 So, we now know:
 - The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ E R (positions 2,4,5 are A, E, R).
 - The letters B and K are not in the word.
 - Additionally, we already knew that C, N, T, S are not in the word.

 Therefore, the absent letters are: B, C, K, N, T, S.

 We need to fill in the first and third positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 The known present letters are: A, E, R (and we have them placed correctly). We don't have any other known present letters that are not yet placed, because we have placed all the ones we know.

 So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] E R

 We must choose letter1 and letter3 from the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding B, C, K, N, T, S.

 The remaining letters are: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a valid English word.

 Common words that fit the pattern and use these letters:

   - ""HATER"": but T is excluded -> invalid.
   - ""WATER"": T excluded -> invalid.
   - ""LATER"": T excluded -> invalid.

 We must avoid T.

 Let's list possible words:

   - ""HALER"": H at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid (a person who hauls).
   - ""MALER"": M at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid (a painter, from German? but accepted in Wordle?).
   - ""PALER"": P at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid (comparative of pale).
   - ""WAFER"": W at 1, A at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""WAGER"": W at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""PAGER"": P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""RAPER"": R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would be two R's. Is that allowed? We don't know. But note: in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate letters. However, it's possible. But let's check: if the word has two R's, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess ""taser"", we had R at position 5 and it was correct. So if there is only one R, that would be consistent. But if there are two R's, then in ""taser"" we had R at position 5 correct, but what about the other R? In ""taser"", we only have one R. So we don't have evidence for two R's. However, we cannot rule it out.

 But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word had two R's, one at position 5 and one at position 2, then the first guess would have shown R as correct at position 2? But it didn't, it showed as present but wrong position. So that means the R at position 2 in the first guess was not correct, so the word does not have an R at position 2. But it does have an R at position 5. So if there is a second R, it must be at a different position. The only positions left are 1 and 3. So if we put R at position 1 or 3, that would be the second R.

 However, we are trying to fill positions 1 and 3. So if we put R at position 1, then the word would be R A _ E R. That would be two R's. Similarly, if we put R at position 3: _ A R E R -> that would be two R's as well.

 But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We have to consider it.

 However, let's see if there are words without duplicates first.

 We have several candidates without duplicates: HALER, MALER, PALER, WAFER, WAGER, PAGER.

 But note: we have not tested the letters H, L, M, P, W, F, G, etc.

 We need to choose a word that uses two new letters to test.

 Since we have two positions to fill, we can test two letters at once.

 How about ""WAFER"": 
   W at 1 and F at 3.

 If we get feedback, we will know about W and F.

 Similarly, ""PAGER"": P at 1 and G at 3.

 But we have many possibilities. We can choose a word that uses common letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that covers multiple possibilities. For example, if we choose ""PALER"", we test P and L.

 But note: ""PALER"" has P at 1 and L at 3. This word is in the list.

 However, we have to avoid using letters that might be duplicates? We don't know.

 Since we have limited guesses, we should avoid using a letter that might be a duplicate until necessary.

 But in this case, we don't have any known duplicate letters so far.

 Let me list the possibilities without duplicates:

   HALER: H, L
   MALER: M, L
   PALER: P, L
   WAFER: W, F
   WAGER: W, G
   PAGER: P, G

 We see that L appears in three words (HALER, MALER, PALER). So if we test L, we can cover three words.

 Similarly, P appears in PALER and PAGER.

 W appears in WAFER and WAGER.

 So if we choose a word that has L at position 3, we can test if L is in the word at that position.

 How about ""HALER"": 
   H at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new).

 If we get:
   H: ✓ and L: ✓ -> then the word is HALER.
   H: ✓ and L: x -> then the word is H A ? E R, and ? is not L. Then we have to find a word with H at 1 and a different letter at 3 (from the remaining, but we don't have many: HAFER? not a word, HAGER? valid, but HAGER has G at 3). But we don't know G yet.
   H: x and L: ✓ -> then the word is ? A L E R, and the first letter is not H. Then it could be MALER or PALER.
   H: x and L: x -> then the word is not HALER and L is not in the word. Then we can eliminate all words with L. Then we are left with WAFER, WAGER, PAGER, and possibly others like FACER (but F is not tested, and C is excluded? C is excluded, so FACER is invalid because of C? Wait, FACER: F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> but C is excluded, so invalid). So without L, we have WAFER, WAGER, PAGER, and maybe others: like JAPER (J at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5) -> valid? meaning one who japes. Or MAPER (not common). 

 So ""HALER"" might not be the best because if we get H and L both wrong, we still have several options.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses two letters that are in different candidate words to maximize elimination.

 For example, if we choose ""PAGER"", we test P and G. This covers:
   If P is present and G is present: then the word is PAGER.
   If P is present and G is absent: then the word might be PALER (if L is present) but we don't know L? Or if P is present and G absent, then we have to consider PALER (but then we need L) or PAPER? but P at 1 and P at 3? duplicate? and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But note: we haven't tested duplicates. Also, PAPER has two P's and we haven't tested P at all. But if we get feedback for P in ""PAGER"": if P is at position 1 and correct, then we get ✓. If the word has P at position 3 (like in PAPER), then we would get for P at 1: - (if there is another P) or x (if only one P and it's at 3). But we don't know.

 This might get complicated.

 Since we have only two positions and we are on the fourth guess, we can try to cover as many candidates as possible.

 The candidates we have are: HALER, MALER, PALER, WAFER, WAGER, PAGER, and possibly others like JAPER, HAZER, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has a letter that appears in many candidates. The letter L appears in HALER, MALER, PALER. The letter P appears in PALER, PAGER, JAPER. The letter W appears in WAFER, WAGER.

 How about we choose a word that has L at position 3? Then we can test L for three candidates.

 But we also need to test the first letter.

 We can choose ""PALER"" to test P and L at the same time.

 If we guess ""PALER"":
   P at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 Feedback:
   P: if present and at 1, then ✓. If present but not at 1, then - (if there is a P at 3, for example). But note: we are putting P at 1 and L at 3. If the word has P at 3, then we would get for P at 1: - (if there is a P at 3) and for L at 3: x (because the P is at 3, so L is not there). But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

   Alternatively, if the word is ""PAGER"", then we have P at 1 (correct) and L at 3 (wrong, because G is there). So we would get P: ✓ and L: x.

   If the word is ""HALER"", then we have P: x and L: ✓.

   If the word is ""MALER"", then P: x and L: ✓.

   If the word is ""WAFER"", then P: x and L: x.

   If the word is ""WAGER"", then P: x and L: x.

   If the word is ""JAPER"", then P: - (if P is at position 3) and L: x.

 So we can get a lot of information.

 But note: we are not testing for the first letter of HALER or MALER. We are only testing P and L.

 However, if we get P: ✓ and L: ✓, then the word is PALER.

 If we get P: ✓ and L: x, then the word is PAGER (because P is at 1 and L is not at 3, so the third letter must be G? because PAGER has G at 3). But wait, what about PAPER? But PAPER has P at 1 and P at 3. Then for ""PALER"", if the word is PAPER, we would get:
   P at 1: ✓ (because it's correct) 
   L at 3: x (because it's P at 3, not L)
   But then we know the third letter is P? But we haven't tested that. And we would then know the word is PAPER? But we have to guess again.

 However, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses after this.

 But note: PAPER has two P's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback for the first guess, we had no duplicates, so it's possible.

 However, we have excluded C, N, T, S, B, K. So if the word is PAPER, then the third letter is P. But we are guessing L at 3, so we get an x for L. Then we would know that the third letter is not L, and we have P at 1 correct. Then we might guess ""PAPER"" next.

 But we can also consider that PAPER is a common word.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the duplicate issue by choosing a word that doesn't have duplicates and uses two new letters that are not in the candidate words? That might not be possible.

 Given the time, I think ""PALER"" is a reasonable guess.

 But let me see if there is a word that can cover more.

 Another idea: we can use a word that has a letter that is in many first positions and a letter that is in many third positions.

 For example, the first position: H, M, P, W, J, etc.
 The third position: L, F, G, P, Z, etc.

 We don't have a word that has, say, a common first letter and a common third letter.

 How about ""WAGER"": W at 1 and G at 3. This covers W and G.

 But then we don't test L, which is in three words.

 So I think ""PALER"" is better because L is in three words.

 Therefore, I will guess ""PALER"".

 But note: we have to make sure that ""PALER"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning paler, more pale).

 So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).
- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.
- **Guess 3 (baker)**: B and K are absent (x), while A, E, and R remain correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- **Absent letters**: B, C, K, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`
- **Remaining possibilities**: Words like `HALER`, `MALER`, `PALER`, `WAFER`, `WAGER`, `PAGER`, `JAPER`, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be `_ A _ E R` with positions 1 and 3 filled by letters not in the absent list (e.g., D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, etc.).
- **""PALER""** is a strategic guess because:
  - Tests **P** at position 1 and **L** at position 3—two new, high-frequency letters.
  - Covers multiple common candidates: 
    - If P is correct and L is correct, the word is `PALER`.
    - If P is correct but L is wrong, consider `PAGER` or `PAPER` next.
    - If L is correct but P is wrong, consider `HALER` or `MALER` next.
    - If both are wrong, focus on words like `WAFER` or `WAGER`.

<guess>paler</guess>",paler,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""baker"":
 B: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, which we already knew)
 K: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
 R: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)

 So, we now know:
 - The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ E R (positions 2,4,5 are A, E, R).
 - The letters B and K are not in the word.
 - Additionally, we already knew that C, N, T, S are not in the word.

   - ""WAFER"": W at 1, A at 2, F at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""WAGER"": W at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""PAGER"": P at 1, A at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> valid.
   - ""RAPER"": R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but R is already at position 5? This would be two R's. Is that allowed? We don't know. But note: in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate letters. However, it's possible.

 But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word had two R's, one at position 5 and one at position 2, then the first guess would have shown R as correct at position 2? But it didn't, it showed as present but wrong position. So that means the R at position 2 in the first guess was not correct, so the word does not have an R at position 2. But it does have an R at position 5. So if there is a second R, it must be at a different position. The only positions left are 1 and 3. So if we put R at position 1 or 3, that would be the second R.

 However, we are trying to fill positions 1 and 3. So if we put R at position 1, then the word would be R A _ E R. That would be two R's. Similarly, if we put R at position 3: _ A R E R -> that would be two R's as well.

 We see that L appears in three words (HALER, MALER, PALER). So if we test L, we can cover three words.

 Similarly, P appears in PALER and PAGER.

 W appears in WAFER and WAGER.

 So if we choose a word that has L at position 3, we can test if L is in the word at that position.

 How about ""HALER"": 
   H at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new).

 If we get:
   H: ✓ and L: ✓ -> then the word is HALER.
   H: ✓ and L: x -> then the word is H A ? E R, and ? is not L. Then we have to find a word with H at 1 and a different letter at 3 (from the remaining, but we don't have many: HAFER? not a word, HAGER? valid, but HAGER has G at 3). But we don't know G yet.

 But we also need to test the first letter.

 We can choose ""PALER"" to test P and L at the same time.

 However, if we get P: ✓ and L: ✓, then the word is PALER.

   P at 1: ✓ (because it's correct) 
   L at 3: x (because it's P at 3, not L)
   But then we know the third letter is P? But we haven't tested that. And we would then know the word is PAPER? But we have to guess again.

 However, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses after this.

 But note: PAPER has two P's. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback for the first guess, we had no duplicates, so it's possible.

 However, we have excluded C, N, T, S, B, K. So if the word is PAPER, then the third letter is P. But we are guessing L at 3, so we get an x for L. Then we would know that the third letter is not L, and we have P at 1 correct. Then we might guess ""PAPER"" next.

 But we can also consider that PAPER is a common word.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the duplicate issue by choosing a word that doesn't have duplicates and uses two new letters that are not in the candidate words? That might not be possible.

 Given the time, I think ""PALER"" is a reasonable guess.

 But let me see if there is a word that can cover more.

 Another idea: we can use a word that has a letter that is in many first positions and a letter that is in many third positions.

 For example, the first position: H, M, P, W, J, etc.
 The third position: L, F, G, P, Z, etc.

 We don't have a word that has, say, a common first letter and a common third letter.

 How about ""WAGER"": W at 1 and G at 3. This covers W and G.

 But then we don't test L, which is in three words.

 So I think ""PALER"" is better because L is in three words.

 Therefore, I will guess ""PALER"".

 But note: we have to make sure that ""PALER"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (meaning paler, more pale).

 So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are present but misplaced (-).
- **Guess 2 (taser)**: T and S are absent (x), while A, E, and R are correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.
- **Guess 3 (baker)**: B and K are absent (x), while A, E, and R remain correct (✓) at positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2: A
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: R
- **Absent letters**: B, C, K, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word pattern**: `_ A _ E R`
- **Remaining possibilities**: Words like `HALER`, `MALER`, `PALER`, `WAFER`, `WAGER`, `PAGER`, `JAPER`, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The secret word must be `_ A _ E R` with positions 1 and 3 filled by letters not in the absent list (e.g., D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, etc.).
- **""PALER""** is a strategic guess because:
  - Tests **P** at position 1 and **L** at position 3—two new, high-frequency letters.
  - Covers multiple common candidates: 
    - If P is correct and L is correct, the word is `PALER`.
    - If P is correct but L is wrong, consider `PAGER` or `PAPER` next.
    - If L is correct but P is wrong, consider `HALER` or `MALER` next.
    - If both are wrong, focus on words like `WAFER` or `WAGER`.",Guess 4: paler -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) L(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
