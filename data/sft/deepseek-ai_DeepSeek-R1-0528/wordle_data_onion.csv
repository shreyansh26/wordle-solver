We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since we don't have any information, we should choose a word that has common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word might be one that has the letters that frequently appear in English words, such as vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.
 One common starting word is ""CRANE"", but let me think of another one that might be equally good. Another popular starting word is ""ROATE"" which is a high-scoring word in terms of letter frequency. However, let's go with ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E - common letters and two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, note that ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 But note: We want to try and cover as much as possible. Another candidate is ""SLATE"". However, for the purpose of this game, ""RAISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SOARE"" (which is a less common word but has high letter frequency) but let's stick to a common word.

 Since the rules say the word must be a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We have 6 tries and no prior information.
 2. Choose a word that has common letters to get maximum feedback.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E. These are all common letters. Specifically, it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, let's guess ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the third letter of the secret word is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position (index 2, if we start counting from 0).
  The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

We must avoid using R, A, S, E in our next guess.

We have 5 positions: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E.
  - Is a valid English word.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Some possibilities:
  We can try words like: 
    ""BLIMP"" -> but note we have to avoid R,A,S,E and we haven't tried B, L, M, P.
    ""CLINT"" -> C, L, N, T are new.
    ""POINT"" -> P, O, I (we know I is already), N, T. But note: we know I is in the word and in the correct position, so we can use it again? Actually, the feedback for I was correct and we know it's in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple I's. However, the feedback for the first guess showed only one I and it was correct. But we don't know for sure if there are duplicates. However, since we are avoiding the letters that are absent, we can try.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed I as present and correct, and the others as absent. So if the word had two I's, then the other I would have been in a different position and we would have seen a '-' for that? But in ""raise"", the I was in the third position and correct. If there was another I in the word, but in a different position, then we would have seen a '-' for that I? However, in ""raise"", there is only one I. So we don't know if there is another I.

But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. Since we only had one I and it was marked correct, and the other positions were marked absent, that means the other positions do not have I? Actually, no: the feedback for the other positions (like the first letter) was R which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about I in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was R: absent, so the first letter is not R and also not I? Actually, the feedback for the first letter being absent only means that the letter R is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about the letter I being in the first position. However, we know that the third letter is I, so if the word had an I in the first position, then when we guessed ""raise"" (which has I only in the third position) we would have seen a '-' for the first letter if the first letter was I? But no, because we didn't put I in the first position. We put R in the first position. So we have no information about whether the word has an I in a position other than the third.

But note: the feedback for the third letter was I and it was correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another I. However, the feedback for the other letters (R, A, S, E) were absent, meaning that the word does not contain R, A, S, E. So if the word had an I in the first position, then when we put R in the first position, we would have gotten a '-' for the first letter? Actually, no: because we put R (which is absent) so we get an 'x'. We didn't put I in the first position, so we don't know if the first letter could be I.

But wait: the feedback for the first letter was R: absent. That means the letter R is not in the word at all. So the first letter cannot be I? Actually, no: the absence of R doesn't say anything about I. The first letter could be I? But we have the third letter as I. So if the word has two I's, then we would have to consider that.

However, we don't have any information about other I's. So we should consider that the word might have another I.

But for now, we are going to avoid the letters R, A, S, E.

We need to choose a word that has the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Let's list some words that fit and don't contain R, A, S, E.

Possible words:
  ""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> but note we have I in the third position. The other letters: B, L, N, D are new.
  ""CLING"" -> C, L, I, N, G
  ""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G
  ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T
  ""MOUNT"" -> M, O, U, N, T -> but third letter is U, not I -> invalid because we need I in the third position.

We must have I in the third position.

We can also consider words that might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern.

One good candidate is ""POINT"": 
  P, O, I, N, T -> all new letters except I (which we know is in the word). This way we test P, O, N, T.

Another candidate is ""CLINT"": but is ""CLINT"" a word? It might be a name, but we need a valid English word. ""Clint"" is a proper name and might not be accepted. Let's avoid.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but the last two letters are M and P. This is a valid word.

""THING"": T, H, I, N, G -> valid.

""CHILL"": C, H, I, L, L -> but has two L's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the word is valid.

But note: we are only allowed to use 5-letter words. ""CHILL"" is 5 letters.

However, we want to avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information? Because if we use two L's and the word has only one L, then we might get one '-' and one 'x', which is less efficient. So it's better to use distinct letters.

Therefore, we prefer words with distinct letters.

""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and new (except I).

""BLIND"" has distinct letters: B, L, I, N, D.

""THING"" has distinct letters: T, H, I, N, G.

""CLING"" has distinct letters: C, L, I, N, G.

We can choose any of these.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: P, O, N, T and we already know I.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so the vowels left are I (we know), O, U. We have O in ""POINT"".

But we don't know if the word has O. So we are testing.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T -> but the third letter is I? Actually, ""BUILT"" is B-U-I-L-T, so the third letter is I. That works. And it has U and I (vowels) and B, L, T (consonants). And distinct letters.

But we haven't tried U. So that's also good.

However, we are going to choose ""POINT"" because it is a very common word and covers more common consonants.

So our next guess: ""POINT""

But let me double-check: we are avoiding R, A, S, E. ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter **I** is in the secret word and is in the **correct position (third letter)**.

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` and excludes the letters R, A, S, E.

For the next guess:
- I must be in the third position.
- The word should avoid R, A, S, E to test new letters.
- I chose **""point""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (with I as the third letter).
  - It introduces new common letters: P, O, N, T (all untested so far).
  - It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It is a valid English word.

<guess>point</guess>",point,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":

  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the third letter of the secret word is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position (index 2, if we start counting from 0).
  The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

We must avoid using R, A, S, E in our next guess.

If there was another I in the word, but in a different position, then we would have seen a '-' for that I? However, in ""raise"", there is only one I. So we don't know if there is another I.

But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. Since we only had one I and it was marked correct, and the other positions were marked absent, that means the other positions do not have I? Actually, no: the feedback for the other positions (like the first letter) was R which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about I in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was R: absent, so the first letter is not R and also not I? Actually, the feedback for the first letter being absent only means that the letter R is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about the letter I being in the first position. However, we know that the third letter is I, so if the word had an I in the first position, then when we guessed ""raise"" (which has I only in the third position) we would have seen a '-' for the first letter if the first letter was I? But no, because we didn't put I in the first position. We put R in the first position. So we have no information about whether the word has an I in a position other than the third.

However, we don't have any information about other I's. So we should consider that the word might have another I.

But for now, we are going to avoid the letters R, A, S, E.

We need to choose a word that has the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Let's list some words that fit and don't contain R, A, S, E.

Possible words:
  ""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> but note we have I in the third position. The other letters: B, L, N, D are new.
  ""CLING"" -> C, L, I, N, G
  ""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G
  ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T
  ""MOUNT"" -> M, O, U, N, T -> but third letter is U, not I -> invalid because we need I in the third position.

We must have I in the third position.

We can also consider words that might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern.

One good candidate is ""POINT"": 
  P, O, I, N, T -> all new letters except I (which we know is in the word). This way we test P, O, N, T.

Another candidate is ""CLINT"": but is ""CLINT"" a word? It might be a name, but we need a valid English word. ""Clint"" is a proper name and might not be accepted. Let's avoid.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but the last two letters are M and P. This is a valid word.

""THING"": T, H, I, N, G -> valid.

""CHILL"": C, H, I, L, L -> but has two L's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the word is valid.

But note: we are only allowed to use 5-letter words. ""CHILL"" is 5 letters.

However, we want to avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information? Because if we use two L's and the word has only one L, then we might get one '-' and one 'x', which is less efficient. So it's better to use distinct letters.

Therefore, we prefer words with distinct letters.

""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and new (except I).

""BLIND"" has distinct letters: B, L, I, N, D.

""THING"" has distinct letters: T, H, I, N, G.

""CLING"" has distinct letters: C, L, I, N, G.

We can choose any of these.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: P, O, N, T and we already know I.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so the vowels left are I (we know), O, U. We have O in ""POINT"".

But we don't know if the word has O. So we are testing.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T -> but the third letter is I? Actually, ""BUILT"" is B-U-I-L-T, so the third letter is I. That works. And it has U and I (vowels) and B, L, T (consonants). And distinct letters.

But we haven't tried U. So that's also good.

However, we are going to choose ""POINT"" because it is a very common word and covers more common consonants.

So our next guess: ""POINT""

But let me double-check: we are avoiding R, A, S, E. ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter **I** is in the secret word and is in the **correct position (third letter)**.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since we don't have any information, we should choose a word that has common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word might be one that has the letters that frequently appear in English words, such as vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.
 One common starting word is ""CRANE"", but let me think of another one that might be equally good. Another popular starting word is ""ROATE"" which is a high-scoring word in terms of letter frequency. However, let's go with ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E - common letters and two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, note that ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 But note: We want to try and cover as much as possible. Another candidate is ""SLATE"". However, for the purpose of this game, ""RAISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SOARE"" (which is a less common word but has high letter frequency) but let's stick to a common word.

 Since the rules say the word must be a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We have 6 tries and no prior information.
 2. Choose a word that has common letters to get maximum feedback.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E. These are all common letters. Specifically, it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, let's guess ""RAISE"".

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the third letter of the secret word is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position (index 2, if we start counting from 0).
  The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

We must avoid using R, A, S, E in our next guess.

We have 5 positions: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E.
  - Is a valid English word.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Some possibilities:
  We can try words like: 
    ""BLIMP"" -> but note we have to avoid R,A,S,E and we haven't tried B, L, M, P.
    ""CLINT"" -> C, L, N, T are new.
    ""POINT"" -> P, O, I (we know I is already), N, T. But note: we know I is in the word and in the correct position, so we can use it again? Actually, the feedback for I was correct and we know it's in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple I's. However, the feedback for the first guess showed only one I and it was correct. But we don't know for sure if there are duplicates. However, since we are avoiding the letters that are absent, we can try.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed I as present and correct, and the others as absent. So if the word had two I's, then the other I would have been in a different position and we would have seen a '-' for that? But in ""raise"", the I was in the third position and correct. If there was another I in the word, but in a different position, then we would have seen a '-' for that I? However, in ""raise"", there is only one I. So we don't know if there is another I.

But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. Since we only had one I and it was marked correct, and the other positions were marked absent, that means the other positions do not have I? Actually, no: the feedback for the other positions (like the first letter) was R which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about I in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was R: absent, so the first letter is not R and also not I? Actually, the feedback for the first letter being absent only means that the letter R is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about the letter I being in the first position. However, we know that the third letter is I, so if the word had an I in the first position, then when we guessed ""raise"" (which has I only in the third position) we would have seen a '-' for the first letter if the first letter was I? But no, because we didn't put I in the first position. We put R in the first position. So we have no information about whether the word has an I in a position other than the third.

But note: the feedback for the third letter was I and it was correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another I. However, the feedback for the other letters (R, A, S, E) were absent, meaning that the word does not contain R, A, S, E. So if the word had an I in the first position, then when we put R in the first position, we would have gotten a '-' for the first letter? Actually, no: because we put R (which is absent) so we get an 'x'. We didn't put I in the first position, so we don't know if the first letter could be I.

But wait: the feedback for the first letter was R: absent. That means the letter R is not in the word at all. So the first letter cannot be I? Actually, no: the absence of R doesn't say anything about I. The first letter could be I? But we have the third letter as I. So if the word has two I's, then we would have to consider that.

However, we don't have any information about other I's. So we should consider that the word might have another I.

But for now, we are going to avoid the letters R, A, S, E.

We need to choose a word that has the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Let's list some words that fit and don't contain R, A, S, E.

Possible words:
  ""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> but note we have I in the third position. The other letters: B, L, N, D are new.
  ""CLING"" -> C, L, I, N, G
  ""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G
  ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T
  ""MOUNT"" -> M, O, U, N, T -> but third letter is U, not I -> invalid because we need I in the third position.

We must have I in the third position.

We can also consider words that might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern.

One good candidate is ""POINT"": 
  P, O, I, N, T -> all new letters except I (which we know is in the word). This way we test P, O, N, T.

Another candidate is ""CLINT"": but is ""CLINT"" a word? It might be a name, but we need a valid English word. ""Clint"" is a proper name and might not be accepted. Let's avoid.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but the last two letters are M and P. This is a valid word.

""THING"": T, H, I, N, G -> valid.

""CHILL"": C, H, I, L, L -> but has two L's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the word is valid.

But note: we are only allowed to use 5-letter words. ""CHILL"" is 5 letters.

However, we want to avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information? Because if we use two L's and the word has only one L, then we might get one '-' and one 'x', which is less efficient. So it's better to use distinct letters.

Therefore, we prefer words with distinct letters.

""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and new (except I).

""BLIND"" has distinct letters: B, L, I, N, D.

""THING"" has distinct letters: T, H, I, N, G.

""CLING"" has distinct letters: C, L, I, N, G.

We can choose any of these.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: P, O, N, T and we already know I.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so the vowels left are I (we know), O, U. We have O in ""POINT"".

But we don't know if the word has O. So we are testing.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T -> but the third letter is I? Actually, ""BUILT"" is B-U-I-L-T, so the third letter is I. That works. And it has U and I (vowels) and B, L, T (consonants). And distinct letters.

But we haven't tried U. So that's also good.

However, we are going to choose ""POINT"" because it is a very common word and covers more common consonants.

So our next guess: ""POINT""

But let me double-check: we are avoiding R, A, S, E. ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter **I** is in the secret word and is in the **correct position (third letter)**.

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` and excludes the letters R, A, S, E.

For the next guess:
- I must be in the third position.
- The word should avoid R, A, S, E to test new letters.
- I chose **""point""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (with I as the third letter).
  - It introduces new common letters: P, O, N, T (all untested so far).
  - It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It is a valid English word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
  - The secret word has the letter I in the third position.
  - The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""point""
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is I, which we already knew)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
  - The secret word contains O and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - Additionally, P and T are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
  - Secret word pattern: _ _ I _ _
  - Letters in the word: I (position 3 fixed), O, and N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, as per ""point"" guess).
  - Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Contains the letters O and N (but not in the second or fourth positions? Note: in ""point"", O was in the second position and was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in the second position. Similarly, N was in the fourth position and marked as present but wrong position, so N cannot be in the fourth position).
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E, P, T.

Also, we have to consider the positions for O and N:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (because in ""point"" it was in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
  - N cannot be in position 4 (because in ""point"" it was in position 4 and got '-').

The secret word has the form: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Constraints on positions:
  - letter2 cannot be O (because O was in position 2 and was wrong)
  - letter4 cannot be N (because N was in position 4 and was wrong)

But note: O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? And N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5? But we have to avoid the positions that were tried and wrong.

Also, we know the word must contain both O and N.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (excluding the absent ones) and satisfies the position constraints.

Available letters: We haven't tried many letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded: R, A, S, E, P, T (6 letters). We have included and know are in the word: O, N, I (but I is fixed). So we can use any other letters that are not excluded.

But note: we must include O and N in the word, and they must be in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's list the possible positions for O and N:

For O: 
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" guess). 
  - Can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For N:
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" guess).
  - Can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word must have both O and N, and we have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5? Actually, we have positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 to fill, but we have two letters (O and N) that must be placed in two of these positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (not in the excluded set).

Excluded letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

So available letters: all consonants and vowels except the excluded ones. Vowels: we have O (which we know is in the word) and we have U, and sometimes Y. But we don't know about U and Y yet. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has the pattern _ _ I _ _, contains O and N, and avoids R,A,S,E,P,T.

We should consider words that have O and N in the allowed positions.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5

But note: if we put O in position 1, then N can be in 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4 only if we are putting it in the same position as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for N in ""point"" was in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that in the secret word, N is present but not in position 4. So N can be in 1, 2, or 5. Similarly, O cannot be in position 2.

So let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: O in position 1, then the word starts with O, then we have: O _ I _ _
  - Then N must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5. But position 2: we can put N? Yes, because the constraint for O was only on position 2, but N can be in position 2. However, we have to check if such a word exists.

Option 2: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 5.

Option 3: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4? Actually, the feedback said N was in the word but not in position 4. So N can be in position 4? No, because if we put N in position 4, then it would be the same as the previous guess and we know it's not there. So N cannot be in position 4. Therefore, in this case, N must be in 1 or 2.

We need to find a valid word that satisfies one of these.

Let's list some candidate words:

Candidate 1: O in position 1 and N in position 2: ""ON _ I _ _""
  - The word would be ""ON"" + something + ""I"" + two letters. But we have to avoid R,A,S,E,P,T.
  - Example: ""ONION"" -> but ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's? Let's check: O N I O N? That's 5 letters? O-N-I-O-N. But we have O in position 1, N in position 2, I in 3, then O in 4 and N in 5? But we have two O's and two N's. Also, the letter O is in position 1 and 4? But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated. Also, the feedback from ""point"" only showed one O and one N, but that doesn't mean there can't be duplicates. However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But ""ONION"" is a valid word. But note: in ""ONION"", the third letter is I, so it fits. But let's check the letters: O, N, I, O, N. We have O and N, and no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

But wait: in the feedback for ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So if we guess ""ONION"", then the O in position 1 would be a new position, and the O in position 4 would be another. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Similarly, N is in position 2 and 5. But in ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was wrong, but in ""ONION"" we have N in position 2 and 5, which are different.

But we are not sure. We can try, but maybe we can find a word without duplicates to get more information.

Candidate 2: O in position 1 and N in position 4: but wait, N cannot be in position 4? Because the feedback from ""point"" said N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, that would be invalid because we know N is not in position 4. So that's not allowed.

Candidate 3: O in position 1 and N in position 5: then pattern: O _ I _ N
  - Example: ""OLIVE"" -> but E is excluded. Not allowed.
  - ""ODIUM"" -> O D I U M. This word? ""ODIUM"" is a valid word. It means widespread hatred. Letters: O, D, I, U, M. Check: no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's allowed. But note: we have U and M, which are new.

Candidate 4: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, which is taken by O). 
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I O _""
      - ""NIXON""? But X is allowed? ""NIXON"" is a proper name? But we need a common word. Also, it has N in position 1 and O in position 4. But the word is ""NIXON"": N-I-X-O-N. But then the third letter is X? We need the third letter to be I. So ""NIXON"" has I in the second position, not third. So not matching.
      - ""NAIRO""? But A is excluded. Not allowed.
      - ""LION"" is 4 letters, not 5.
      - How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N. This has: position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N. So it fits the pattern. And it has O in position 4 and N in positions 2 and 5. But note: we have N in position 2 and 5. And O in position 4. Also, no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

Candidate 5: O in position 4 and N in position 2: that would be _ N I O _
  - Example: ""UNION"" as above has N in position 2 and O in position 4? Actually, in ""UNION"": 
        position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N -> so yes, it has N in position2 and O in position4.

Candidate 6: O in position 4 and N in position 5: _ _ I O N -> example: ""VISION"" but that's 6 letters. ""JUMBO"" doesn't have I in the middle. ""MINOR"" has R which is excluded. ""PILOT"" has P and T which are excluded. So hard to find.

Candidate 7: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 5 is taken by O).
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I _ O""
      - ""NITRO"" but R and T excluded. 
      - ""NICHO"" -> not a word? 
      - ""NINJO"" -> not a word.
  - Example: if N in position 2: "" _ N I _ O""
      - ""UNCIO"" -> not a word.
      - ""ONICO"" -> not a word.

So the main candidates we have are:
  - ""ONION"": O in 1 and 4, N in 2 and 5 -> pattern: O N I O N
  - ""ODIUM"": O in 1, D in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5 -> pattern: O D I U M
  - ""UNION"": U in 1, N in 2, I in 3, O in 4, N in 5 -> pattern: U N I O N

We need to choose one that is a valid word and maximizes information.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters. We want to test new letters.

In ""ONION"": we are testing O and N again, but we already know they are in the word. We are not testing new letters for the other positions. Specifically, we are not testing any new letters in positions 1,2,4,5 because we are using O and N for multiple positions. We would only learn about the positions of O and N, but we already know they are in the word. However, we might learn if there are duplicates.

In ""ODIUM"": we are testing new letters: D, U, M. And we are putting O in position 1 (which is a new position for O) and we are not using N? But wait, we know N is in the word, but in ""ODIUM"" we don't have N. That's a problem! We must include N because the feedback from ""point"" told us that N is in the word (it was marked as present). So we cannot guess a word that does not have N.

Therefore, ""ODIUM"" is invalid because it does not contain N.

Similarly, we must include O and N.

So ""ONION"" and ""UNION"" both have O and N.

But ""ONION"" has O in position 1 and 4, and N in position 2 and 5. We know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point"") but we are putting O in 1 and 4, which are allowed. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, but in ""ONION"", N is in 2 and 5, so position 4 is O, not N. So that's okay.

In ""UNION"", we have O in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 2 and 5 (position 4 is O, so N is not in 4, which is good).

But both words have duplicate letters. We might get less information if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, can we find a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and with distinct new letters?

For example, O in position 1 and N in position 5: pattern: O _ I _ N
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not excluded and form a word.
  - Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O in 1) and cannot be a letter that is excluded. So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Position 4: similarly.
  - Example: ""OLIVN"" -> not a word.
  - ""OBLIN"" -> not a word.
  - ""O MIN something"" -> hard.

Another possibility: O in position 1 and N in position 2: pattern: O N I _ _
  - Then we need two letters for positions 4 and 5, not excluded and form a word.
  - Example: ""ONIUM"" -> not a word? ""ONIUM"" is a chemistry term? But let's see if it's accepted. Alternatively, ""ONCET"" -> not a word and T is excluded.
  - ""ONLY"" is 4 letters.

O in position 4 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I O _
  - Example: ""N D I O M"" -> ""NDIOM"" not a word.
  - ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word.

O in position 4 and N in position 5: pattern: _ _ I O N
  - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> ""LUTION"" is not 5 letters? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is not 5.

O in position 5 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I _ O
  - Example: ""N O I D O"" -> ""NODIO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> but C and K are allowed, but ""NICKO"" not common. ""NIVEO"" not a word.

O in position 5 and N in position 2: pattern: _ N I _ O
  - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" is an organization, but is it a word? Not really. ""UNICO"" -> not a word. ""UNIFO"" not a word.

Given the difficulty, it might be that the word has duplicate letters. So we have to consider ""ONION"" or ""UNION"".

But note: in ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. So if the secret word has only one O, then one of these will be marked as absent? But the feedback for ""point"" only showed one O (because we had one O in the guess and it was marked as present). So the secret word might have exactly one O. Similarly for N: we had one N in ""point"" and it was marked present, so the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more.

But if we guess ""ONION"", which has two O's and two N's, and the secret word has only one O and one N, then we might get feedback that one O is correct and the other is absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and use new letters for the rest.

Let me try to find such a word:

Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to include O and N, each once, and in positions that are allowed.

Possible configurations:

1. O in 1, N in 2: then word: O N I ? ? 
   - We need two more letters. Words: ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's, so not one. ""ONCET"" is not a word. ""ONLY"" is 4 letters. ""ONKUS"" not common. ""ONIUM"" might be accepted? But let's see: ""ONIUM"" is a term in chemistry, but it's 5 letters: O-N-I-U-M. So that's O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5. And it has only one O and one N. And no R,A,S,E,P,T. So ""ONIUM"" is a candidate.

2. O in 1, N in 4: but N cannot be in 4? Because we know N is not in position 4. So invalid.

3. O in 1, N in 5: then word: O ? I ? N
   - Example: ""O M I D N"" -> not a word. ""O U I D N"" -> not a word. ""OVID"" is 4 letters. ""OLEIN"" has E and L? ""OLEIN"" is O-L-E-I-N, but E is excluded. ""ODYLN"" not a word. So hard.

4. O in 4, N in 1: word: N ? I O ?
   - Example: ""N O I O ?"" -> duplicate O? We want one O. ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word. ""N I C O L"" -> ""NICOL"" is a name? Not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not a word.

5. O in 4, N in 2: word: ? N I O ?
   - Example: ""U N I O N"" -> that's ""UNION"", which has two N's. But we want one N? Then we need a word with N only in position 2 and O in 4. Example: ""C N I O ?"" -> ""CNIOW"" not a word. ""UNIO"" is 4 letters. ""UNCO"" is 4. ""UNIOL"" not a word.

6. O in 4, N in 5: word: ? ? I O N
   - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> not 5? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is 4. ""SCION"" has S which is excluded. ""BRION"" has R and B? R is excluded. ""FLUION"" not a word.

7. O in 5, N in 1: word: N ? I ? O
   - Example: ""N U I D O"" -> ""NUIDO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> ""NICKO"" not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not 5.

8. O in 5, N in 2: word: ? N I ? O
   - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" not a word. ""U N I F O"" -> ""UNIFO"" not a word. ""UNCIO"" not a word.

So the only candidate we found with one O and one N is ""ONIUM"" (O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5). But is ""ONIUM"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""onium"" is a noun (chemistry) meaning a cation. It is accepted in word games sometimes. But to be safe, we might choose a more common word.

Alternatively, we can use ""UNION"" or ""ONION"", which are common words.

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If we guess ""UNION"":
  - Pattern: U N I O N
  - We know the secret word has I in position 3, and contains O and N (but not in position 4 for N and not in position 2 for O). In ""UNION"", we have:
        position1: U -> new letter
        position2: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know.
        position3: I -> correct
        position4: O -> we know O is in the word, but is it in position 4? We don't know.
        position5: N -> duplicate N.

  - The feedback will tell us about U, N (in two positions), and O.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: what about ""LOVING""? But that's 6 letters.

Or ""GOING"" is 5 letters but has G and O, but no I in the third? ""GOING"" is G-O-I-N-G, so third letter is I? Yes. Pattern: G O I N G. But we have O in position 2, which we know is not allowed (because in ""point"", O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use ""GOING"" because it has O in position 2.

Another idea: ""COVIN"" -> C O V I N. But O is in position 2, which is forbidden. Not allowed.

So after careful thought, I think ""UNION"" is a good guess because it is a common word and fits the constraints.

But let's check the feedback from ""point"": O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong. In ""UNION"", we are putting O in position 4. That's allowed. And N was in position 4 in ""point"" and was wrong, but in ""UNION"" we are putting N in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is new for N, and position 5 is new.

So I'll go with ""UNION"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""UNION"" has U, N, I, O, N. Excluded are R,A,S,E,P,T. U is not excluded, so it's fine.

So guess: ""UNION""

But wait, is there a better word? What about ""MINOR""? But R is excluded. ""HINGE"" has E and H? E is excluded.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" was considered earlier, but it has U and I, but no O or N? We must include O and N.

We must include both O and N.

So ""UNION"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""ONION"" is also good.

But let's choose ""UNION"" because it has U which is a new vowel.

So I'll guess ""UNION"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct position), S (absent), E (absent).  
  This means:  
  - The secret word has ""I"" in the third position (position 3).  
  - R, A, S, and E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""**  
  Feedback: P (absent), O (present but wrong position), I (correct position), N (present but wrong position), T (absent).  
  This means:  
  - O and N are in the secret word, but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4.  
  - P and T are **not** in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I _ _` (I is fixed in position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I (position 3), O, and N.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback).  
- **Position constraints for N**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must include **O** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), with O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.  
- The word must avoid R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- To maximize information, prioritize words that:  
  - Place O and N in new positions (e.g., O in positions 1, 4, or 5; N in positions 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, M, D, C) to test more of the alphabet.  
- After evaluating options (like ""ONION"", ""ODIUM"", and ""UNION""), **""UNION""** is selected because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` with I in position 3.  
  - It contains O (in position 4) and N (in positions 2 and 5), satisfying the position constraints (O not in position 2, N not in position 4).  
  - It uses new letters (U) and avoids absent letters (R, A, S, E, P, T).  
  - It is a common English word, increasing the likelihood of validity.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- The position of O (if it is in position 4).  
- The position of N (if it is in position 2 or 5).  
- Whether U is in the word and its position.  

<guess>union</guess>",union,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
  - The secret word has the letter I in the third position.
  - The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""point""
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is I, which we already knew)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
  - The secret word contains O and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - Additionally, P and T are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
  - Secret word pattern: _ _ I _ _
  - Letters in the word: I (position 3 fixed), O, and N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, as per ""point"" guess).
  - Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Contains the letters O and N (but not in the second or fourth positions? Note: in ""point"", O was in the second position and was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in the second position. Similarly, N was in the fourth position and marked as present but wrong position, so N cannot be in the fourth position).
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E, P, T.

Also, we have to consider the positions for O and N:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (because in ""point"" it was in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
  - N cannot be in position 4 (because in ""point"" it was in position 4 and got '-').

The secret word has the form: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Constraints on positions:
  - letter2 cannot be O (because O was in position 2 and was wrong)
  - letter4 cannot be N (because N was in position 4 and was wrong)

But note: O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? And N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5? But we have to avoid the positions that were tried and wrong.

Also, we know the word must contain both O and N.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (excluding the absent ones) and satisfies the position constraints.

Available letters: We haven't tried many letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded: R, A, S, E, P, T (6 letters). We have included and know are in the word: O, N, I (but I is fixed). So we can use any other letters that are not excluded.

But note: we must include O and N in the word, and they must be in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's list the possible positions for O and N:

For O: 
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" guess). 
  - Can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For N:
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" guess).
  - Can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word must have both O and N, and we have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5? Actually, we have positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 to fill, but we have two letters (O and N) that must be placed in two of these positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (not in the excluded set).

Excluded letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

So available letters: all consonants and vowels except the excluded ones. Vowels: we have O (which we know is in the word) and we have U, and sometimes Y. But we don't know about U and Y yet. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has the pattern _ _ I _ _, contains O and N, and avoids R,A,S,E,P,T.

We should consider words that have O and N in the allowed positions.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5

But note: if we put O in position 1, then N can be in 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4 only if we are putting it in the same position as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for N in ""point"" was in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that in the secret word, N is present but not in position 4. So N can be in 1, 2, or 5. Similarly, O cannot be in position 2.

So let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: O in position 1, then the word starts with O, then we have: O _ I _ _
  - Then N must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5. But position 2: we can put N? Yes, because the constraint for O was only on position 2, but N can be in position 2. However, we have to check if such a word exists.

Option 2: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 5.

Option 3: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4? Actually, the feedback said N was in the word but not in position 4. So N can be in position 4? No, because if we put N in position 4, then it would be the same as the previous guess and we know it's not there. So N cannot be in position 4. Therefore, in this case, N must be in 1 or 2.

We need to find a valid word that satisfies one of these.

Let's list some candidate words:

Candidate 1: O in position 1 and N in position 2: ""ON _ I _ _""
  - The word would be ""ON"" + something + ""I"" + two letters. But we have to avoid R,A,S,E,P,T.
  - Example: ""ONION"" -> but ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's? Let's check: O N I O N? That's 5 letters? O-N-I-O-N. But we have O in position 1, N in position 2, I in 3, then O in 4 and N in 5? But we have two O's and two N's. Also, the letter O is in position 1 and 4? But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated. Also, the feedback from ""point"" only showed one O and one N, but that doesn't mean there can't be duplicates. However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But ""ONION"" is a valid word. But note: in ""ONION"", the third letter is I, so it fits. But let's check the letters: O, N, I, O, N. We have O and N, and no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

But wait: in the feedback for ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So if we guess ""ONION"", then the O in position 1 would be a new position, and the O in position 4 would be another. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Similarly, N is in position 2 and 5. But in ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was wrong, but in ""ONION"" we have N in position 2 and 5, which are different.

But we are not sure. We can try, but maybe we can find a word without duplicates to get more information.

Candidate 2: O in position 1 and N in position 4: but wait, N cannot be in position 4? Because the feedback from ""point"" said N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, that would be invalid because we know N is not in position 4. So that's not allowed.

Candidate 3: O in position 1 and N in position 5: then pattern: O _ I _ N
  - Example: ""OLIVE"" -> but E is excluded. Not allowed.
  - ""ODIUM"" -> O D I U M. This word? ""ODIUM"" is a valid word. It means widespread hatred. Letters: O, D, I, U, M. Check: no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's allowed. But note: we have U and M, which are new.

Candidate 4: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, which is taken by O). 
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I O _""
      - ""NIXON""? But X is allowed? ""NIXON"" is a proper name? But we need a common word. Also, it has N in position 1 and O in position 4. But the word is ""NIXON"": N-I-X-O-N. But then the third letter is X? We need the third letter to be I. So ""NIXON"" has I in the second position, not third. So not matching.
      - ""NAIRO""? But A is excluded. Not allowed.
      - ""LION"" is 4 letters, not 5.
      - How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N. This has: position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N. So it fits the pattern. And it has O in position 4 and N in positions 2 and 5. But note: we have N in position 2 and 5. And O in position 4. Also, no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

Candidate 5: O in position 4 and N in position 2: that would be _ N I O _
  - Example: ""UNION"" as above has N in position 2 and O in position 4? Actually, in ""UNION"": 
        position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N -> so yes, it has N in position2 and O in position4.

Candidate 6: O in position 4 and N in position 5: _ _ I O N -> example: ""VISION"" but that's 6 letters. ""JUMBO"" doesn't have I in the middle. ""MINOR"" has R which is excluded. ""PILOT"" has P and T which are excluded. So hard to find.

Candidate 7: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 5 is taken by O).
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I _ O""
      - ""NITRO"" but R and T excluded. 
      - ""NICHO"" -> not a word? 
      - ""NINJO"" -> not a word.
  - Example: if N in position 2: "" _ N I _ O""
      - ""UNCIO"" -> not a word.
      - ""ONICO"" -> not a word.

So the main candidates we have are:
  - ""ONION"": O in 1 and 4, N in 2 and 5 -> pattern: O N I O N
  - ""ODIUM"": O in 1, D in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5 -> pattern: O D I U M
  - ""UNION"": U in 1, N in 2, I in 3, O in 4, N in 5 -> pattern: U N I O N

We need to choose one that is a valid word and maximizes information.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters. We want to test new letters.

In ""ONION"": we are testing O and N again, but we already know they are in the word. We are not testing new letters for the other positions. Specifically, we are not testing any new letters in positions 1,2,4,5 because we are using O and N for multiple positions. We would only learn about the positions of O and N, but we already know they are in the word. However, we might learn if there are duplicates.

In ""ODIUM"": we are testing new letters: D, U, M. And we are putting O in position 1 (which is a new position for O) and we are not using N? But wait, we know N is in the word, but in ""ODIUM"" we don't have N. That's a problem! We must include N because the feedback from ""point"" told us that N is in the word (it was marked as present). So we cannot guess a word that does not have N.

Therefore, ""ODIUM"" is invalid because it does not contain N.

Similarly, we must include O and N.

So ""ONION"" and ""UNION"" both have O and N.

But ""ONION"" has O in position 1 and 4, and N in position 2 and 5. We know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point"") but we are putting O in 1 and 4, which are allowed. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, but in ""ONION"", N is in 2 and 5, so position 4 is O, not N. So that's okay.

In ""UNION"", we have O in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 2 and 5 (position 4 is O, so N is not in 4, which is good).

But both words have duplicate letters. We might get less information if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, can we find a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and with distinct new letters?

For example, O in position 1 and N in position 5: pattern: O _ I _ N
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not excluded and form a word.
  - Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O in 1) and cannot be a letter that is excluded. So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Position 4: similarly.
  - Example: ""OLIVN"" -> not a word.
  - ""OBLIN"" -> not a word.
  - ""O MIN something"" -> hard.

Another possibility: O in position 1 and N in position 2: pattern: O N I _ _
  - Then we need two letters for positions 4 and 5, not excluded and form a word.
  - Example: ""ONIUM"" -> not a word? ""ONIUM"" is a chemistry term? But let's see if it's accepted. Alternatively, ""ONCET"" -> not a word and T is excluded.
  - ""ONLY"" is 4 letters.

O in position 4 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I O _
  - Example: ""N D I O M"" -> ""NDIOM"" not a word.
  - ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word.

O in position 4 and N in position 5: pattern: _ _ I O N
  - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> ""LUTION"" is not 5 letters? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is not 5.

O in position 5 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I _ O
  - Example: ""N O I D O"" -> ""NODIO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> but C and K are allowed, but ""NICKO"" not common. ""NIVEO"" not a word.

O in position 5 and N in position 2: pattern: _ N I _ O
  - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" is an organization, but is it a word? Not really. ""UNICO"" -> not a word. ""UNIFO"" not a word.

Given the difficulty, it might be that the word has duplicate letters. So we have to consider ""ONION"" or ""UNION"".

But note: in ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. So if the secret word has only one O, then one of these will be marked as absent? But the feedback for ""point"" only showed one O (because we had one O in the guess and it was marked as present). So the secret word might have exactly one O. Similarly for N: we had one N in ""point"" and it was marked present, so the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more.

But if we guess ""ONION"", which has two O's and two N's, and the secret word has only one O and one N, then we might get feedback that one O is correct and the other is absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and use new letters for the rest.

Let me try to find such a word:

Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to include O and N, each once, and in positions that are allowed.

Possible configurations:

1. O in 1, N in 2: then word: O N I ? ? 
   - We need two more letters. Words: ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's, so not one. ""ONCET"" is not a word. ""ONLY"" is 4 letters. ""ONKUS"" not common. ""ONIUM"" might be accepted? But let's see: ""ONIUM"" is a term in chemistry, but it's 5 letters: O-N-I-U-M. So that's O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5. And it has only one O and one N. And no R,A,S,E,P,T. So ""ONIUM"" is a candidate.

2. O in 1, N in 4: but N cannot be in 4? Because we know N is not in position 4. So invalid.

3. O in 1, N in 5: then word: O ? I ? N
   - Example: ""O M I D N"" -> not a word. ""O U I D N"" -> not a word. ""OVID"" is 4 letters. ""OLEIN"" has E and L? ""OLEIN"" is O-L-E-I-N, but E is excluded. ""ODYLN"" not a word. So hard.

4. O in 4, N in 1: word: N ? I O ?
   - Example: ""N O I O ?"" -> duplicate O? We want one O. ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word. ""N I C O L"" -> ""NICOL"" is a name? Not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not a word.

5. O in 4, N in 2: word: ? N I O ?
   - Example: ""U N I O N"" -> that's ""UNION"", which has two N's. But we want one N? Then we need a word with N only in position 2 and O in 4. Example: ""C N I O ?"" -> ""CNIOW"" not a word. ""UNIO"" is 4 letters. ""UNCO"" is 4. ""UNIOL"" not a word.

6. O in 4, N in 5: word: ? ? I O N
   - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> not 5? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is 4. ""SCION"" has S which is excluded. ""BRION"" has R and B? R is excluded. ""FLUION"" not a word.

7. O in 5, N in 1: word: N ? I ? O
   - Example: ""N U I D O"" -> ""NUIDO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> ""NICKO"" not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not 5.

8. O in 5, N in 2: word: ? N I ? O
   - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" not a word. ""U N I F O"" -> ""UNIFO"" not a word. ""UNCIO"" not a word.

So the only candidate we found with one O and one N is ""ONIUM"" (O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5). But is ""ONIUM"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""onium"" is a noun (chemistry) meaning a cation. It is accepted in word games sometimes. But to be safe, we might choose a more common word.

Alternatively, we can use ""UNION"" or ""ONION"", which are common words.

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If we guess ""UNION"":
  - Pattern: U N I O N
  - We know the secret word has I in position 3, and contains O and N (but not in position 4 for N and not in position 2 for O). In ""UNION"", we have:
        position1: U -> new letter
        position2: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know.
        position3: I -> correct
        position4: O -> we know O is in the word, but is it in position 4? We don't know.
        position5: N -> duplicate N.

  - The feedback will tell us about U, N (in two positions), and O.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: what about ""LOVING""? But that's 6 letters.

Or ""GOING"" is 5 letters but has G and O, but no I in the third? ""GOING"" is G-O-I-N-G, so third letter is I? Yes. Pattern: G O I N G. But we have O in position 2, which we know is not allowed (because in ""point"", O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use ""GOING"" because it has O in position 2.

Another idea: ""COVIN"" -> C O V I N. But O is in position 2, which is forbidden. Not allowed.

So after careful thought, I think ""UNION"" is a good guess because it is a common word and fits the constraints.

But let's check the feedback from ""point"": O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong. In ""UNION"", we are putting O in position 4. That's allowed. And N was in position 4 in ""point"" and was wrong, but in ""UNION"" we are putting N in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is new for N, and position 5 is new.

So I'll go with ""UNION"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""UNION"" has U, N, I, O, N. Excluded are R,A,S,E,P,T. U is not excluded, so it's fine.

So guess: ""UNION""

But wait, is there a better word? What about ""MINOR""? But R is excluded. ""HINGE"" has E and H? E is excluded.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" was considered earlier, but it has U and I, but no O or N? We must include O and N.

We must include both O and N.

So ""UNION"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""ONION"" is also good.

But let's choose ""UNION"" because it has U which is a new vowel.

So I'll guess ""UNION"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct position), S (absent), E (absent).  
  This means:  
  - The secret word has ""I"" in the third position (position 3).  
  - R, A, S, and E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""**  
  Feedback: P (absent), O (present but wrong position), I (correct position), N (present but wrong position), T (absent).  
  This means:  
  - O and N are in the secret word, but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4.  
  - P and T are **not** in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I _ _` (I is fixed in position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I (position 3), O, and N.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback).  
- **Position constraints for N**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must include **O** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), with O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.  
- The word must avoid R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- To maximize information, prioritize words that:  
  - Place O and N in new positions (e.g., O in positions 1, 4, or 5; N in positions 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, M, D, C) to test more of the alphabet.  
- After evaluating options (like ""ONION"", ""ODIUM"", and ""UNION""), **""UNION""** is selected because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` with I in position 3.  
  - It contains O (in position 4) and N (in positions 2 and 5), satisfying the position constraints (O not in position 2, N not in position 4).  
  - It uses new letters (U) and avoids absent letters (R, A, S, E, P, T).  
  - It is a common English word, increasing the likelihood of validity.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- The position of O (if it is in position 4).  
- The position of N (if it is in position 2 or 5).  
- Whether U is in the word and its position.",Guess 3: union -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,onion,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since we don't have any information, we should choose a word that has common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants.
 A good starting word might be one that has the letters that frequently appear in English words, such as vowels: A, E, I, O, U and common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.
 One common starting word is ""CRANE"", but let me think of another one that might be equally good. Another popular starting word is ""ROATE"" which is a high-scoring word in terms of letter frequency. However, let's go with ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E - common letters and two vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). Also, note that ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 But note: We want to try and cover as much as possible. Another candidate is ""SLATE"". However, for the purpose of this game, ""RAISE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SOARE"" (which is a less common word but has high letter frequency) but let's stick to a common word.

 Since the rules say the word must be a valid English word, I'll pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We have 6 tries and no prior information.
 2. Choose a word that has common letters to get maximum feedback.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains R, A, I, S, E. These are all common letters. Specifically, it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, let's guess ""RAISE"".

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so the third letter of the secret word is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Therefore, we know:
  The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position (index 2, if we start counting from 0).
  The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

We must avoid using R, A, S, E in our next guess.

We have 5 positions: _ _ I _ _

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E.
  - Is a valid English word.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Some possibilities:
  We can try words like: 
    ""BLIMP"" -> but note we have to avoid R,A,S,E and we haven't tried B, L, M, P.
    ""CLINT"" -> C, L, N, T are new.
    ""POINT"" -> P, O, I (we know I is already), N, T. But note: we know I is in the word and in the correct position, so we can use it again? Actually, the feedback for I was correct and we know it's in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple I's. However, the feedback for the first guess showed only one I and it was correct. But we don't know for sure if there are duplicates. However, since we are avoiding the letters that are absent, we can try.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed I as present and correct, and the others as absent. So if the word had two I's, then the other I would have been in a different position and we would have seen a '-' for that? But in ""raise"", the I was in the third position and correct. If there was another I in the word, but in a different position, then we would have seen a '-' for that I? However, in ""raise"", there is only one I. So we don't know if there is another I.

But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. Since we only had one I and it was marked correct, and the other positions were marked absent, that means the other positions do not have I? Actually, no: the feedback for the other positions (like the first letter) was R which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about I in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was R: absent, so the first letter is not R and also not I? Actually, the feedback for the first letter being absent only means that the letter R is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about the letter I being in the first position. However, we know that the third letter is I, so if the word had an I in the first position, then when we guessed ""raise"" (which has I only in the third position) we would have seen a '-' for the first letter if the first letter was I? But no, because we didn't put I in the first position. We put R in the first position. So we have no information about whether the word has an I in a position other than the third.

But note: the feedback for the third letter was I and it was correct. That doesn't prevent the word from having another I. However, the feedback for the other letters (R, A, S, E) were absent, meaning that the word does not contain R, A, S, E. So if the word had an I in the first position, then when we put R in the first position, we would have gotten a '-' for the first letter? Actually, no: because we put R (which is absent) so we get an 'x'. We didn't put I in the first position, so we don't know if the first letter could be I.

But wait: the feedback for the first letter was R: absent. That means the letter R is not in the word at all. So the first letter cannot be I? Actually, no: the absence of R doesn't say anything about I. The first letter could be I? But we have the third letter as I. So if the word has two I's, then we would have to consider that.

However, we don't have any information about other I's. So we should consider that the word might have another I.

But for now, we are going to avoid the letters R, A, S, E.

We need to choose a word that has the pattern: _ _ I _ _

Let's list some words that fit and don't contain R, A, S, E.

Possible words:
  ""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> but note we have I in the third position. The other letters: B, L, N, D are new.
  ""CLING"" -> C, L, I, N, G
  ""THING"" -> T, H, I, N, G
  ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T
  ""MOUNT"" -> M, O, U, N, T -> but third letter is U, not I -> invalid because we need I in the third position.

We must have I in the third position.

We can also consider words that might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

We want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern.

One good candidate is ""POINT"": 
  P, O, I, N, T -> all new letters except I (which we know is in the word). This way we test P, O, N, T.

Another candidate is ""CLINT"": but is ""CLINT"" a word? It might be a name, but we need a valid English word. ""Clint"" is a proper name and might not be accepted. Let's avoid.

""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but the last two letters are M and P. This is a valid word.

""THING"": T, H, I, N, G -> valid.

""CHILL"": C, H, I, L, L -> but has two L's. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the word is valid.

But note: we are only allowed to use 5-letter words. ""CHILL"" is 5 letters.

However, we want to avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information? Because if we use two L's and the word has only one L, then we might get one '-' and one 'x', which is less efficient. So it's better to use distinct letters.

Therefore, we prefer words with distinct letters.

""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and new (except I).

""BLIND"" has distinct letters: B, L, I, N, D.

""THING"" has distinct letters: T, H, I, N, G.

""CLING"" has distinct letters: C, L, I, N, G.

We can choose any of these.

I think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: P, O, N, T and we already know I.

So let's go with ""POINT"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so the vowels left are I (we know), O, U. We have O in ""POINT"".

But we don't know if the word has O. So we are testing.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T -> but the third letter is I? Actually, ""BUILT"" is B-U-I-L-T, so the third letter is I. That works. And it has U and I (vowels) and B, L, T (consonants). And distinct letters.

But we haven't tried U. So that's also good.

However, we are going to choose ""POINT"" because it is a very common word and covers more common consonants.

So our next guess: ""POINT""

But let me double-check: we are avoiding R, A, S, E. ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.

Therefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R, A, S, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- The letter **I** is in the secret word and is in the **correct position (third letter)**.

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` and excludes the letters R, A, S, E.

For the next guess:
- I must be in the third position.
- The word should avoid R, A, S, E to test new letters.
- I chose **""point""** because:
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (with I as the third letter).
  - It introduces new common letters: P, O, N, T (all untested so far).
  - It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It is a valid English word.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
  - The secret word has the letter I in the third position.
  - The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""point""
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is I, which we already knew)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
  - The secret word contains O and N, but not in the positions we guessed.
  - Additionally, P and T are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
  - Secret word pattern: _ _ I _ _
  - Letters in the word: I (position 3 fixed), O, and N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, as per ""point"" guess).
  - Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has 'I' as the third letter.
  - Contains the letters O and N (but not in the second or fourth positions? Note: in ""point"", O was in the second position and was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in the second position. Similarly, N was in the fourth position and marked as present but wrong position, so N cannot be in the fourth position).
  - Does not contain R, A, S, E, P, T.

Also, we have to consider the positions for O and N:
  - O cannot be in position 2 (because in ""point"" it was in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
  - N cannot be in position 4 (because in ""point"" it was in position 4 and got '-').

The secret word has the form: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]

Constraints on positions:
  - letter2 cannot be O (because O was in position 2 and was wrong)
  - letter4 cannot be N (because N was in position 4 and was wrong)

But note: O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? And N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5? But we have to avoid the positions that were tried and wrong.

Also, we know the word must contain both O and N.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (excluding the absent ones) and satisfies the position constraints.

Available letters: We haven't tried many letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded: R, A, S, E, P, T (6 letters). We have included and know are in the word: O, N, I (but I is fixed). So we can use any other letters that are not excluded.

But note: we must include O and N in the word, and they must be in positions that are not forbidden.

Let's list the possible positions for O and N:

For O: 
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" guess). 
  - Can be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For N:
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" guess).
  - Can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word must have both O and N, and we have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5? Actually, we have positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 to fill, but we have two letters (O and N) that must be placed in two of these positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (not in the excluded set).

Excluded letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.

So available letters: all consonants and vowels except the excluded ones. Vowels: we have O (which we know is in the word) and we have U, and sometimes Y. But we don't know about U and Y yet. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has the pattern _ _ I _ _, contains O and N, and avoids R,A,S,E,P,T.

We should consider words that have O and N in the allowed positions.

Possible positions for O: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 5

But note: if we put O in position 1, then N can be in 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4 only if we are putting it in the same position as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for N in ""point"" was in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that in the secret word, N is present but not in position 4. So N can be in 1, 2, or 5. Similarly, O cannot be in position 2.

So let's try to think of words that fit:

Option 1: O in position 1, then the word starts with O, then we have: O _ I _ _
  - Then N must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5. But position 2: we can put N? Yes, because the constraint for O was only on position 2, but N can be in position 2. However, we have to check if such a word exists.

Option 2: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 5.

Option 3: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4? Actually, the feedback said N was in the word but not in position 4. So N can be in position 4? No, because if we put N in position 4, then it would be the same as the previous guess and we know it's not there. So N cannot be in position 4. Therefore, in this case, N must be in 1 or 2.

We need to find a valid word that satisfies one of these.

Let's list some candidate words:

Candidate 1: O in position 1 and N in position 2: ""ON _ I _ _""
  - The word would be ""ON"" + something + ""I"" + two letters. But we have to avoid R,A,S,E,P,T.
  - Example: ""ONION"" -> but ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's? Let's check: O N I O N? That's 5 letters? O-N-I-O-N. But we have O in position 1, N in position 2, I in 3, then O in 4 and N in 5? But we have two O's and two N's. Also, the letter O is in position 1 and 4? But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated. Also, the feedback from ""point"" only showed one O and one N, but that doesn't mean there can't be duplicates. However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. But ""ONION"" is a valid word. But note: in ""ONION"", the third letter is I, so it fits. But let's check the letters: O, N, I, O, N. We have O and N, and no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

But wait: in the feedback for ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So if we guess ""ONION"", then the O in position 1 would be a new position, and the O in position 4 would be another. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Similarly, N is in position 2 and 5. But in ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was wrong, but in ""ONION"" we have N in position 2 and 5, which are different.

But we are not sure. We can try, but maybe we can find a word without duplicates to get more information.

Candidate 2: O in position 1 and N in position 4: but wait, N cannot be in position 4? Because the feedback from ""point"" said N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, that would be invalid because we know N is not in position 4. So that's not allowed.

Candidate 3: O in position 1 and N in position 5: then pattern: O _ I _ N
  - Example: ""OLIVE"" -> but E is excluded. Not allowed.
  - ""ODIUM"" -> O D I U M. This word? ""ODIUM"" is a valid word. It means widespread hatred. Letters: O, D, I, U, M. Check: no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's allowed. But note: we have U and M, which are new.

Candidate 4: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _
  - Then N must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, which is taken by O). 
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I O _""
      - ""NIXON""? But X is allowed? ""NIXON"" is a proper name? But we need a common word. Also, it has N in position 1 and O in position 4. But the word is ""NIXON"": N-I-X-O-N. But then the third letter is X? We need the third letter to be I. So ""NIXON"" has I in the second position, not third. So not matching.
      - ""NAIRO""? But A is excluded. Not allowed.
      - ""LION"" is 4 letters, not 5.
      - How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N. This has: position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N. So it fits the pattern. And it has O in position 4 and N in positions 2 and 5. But note: we have N in position 2 and 5. And O in position 4. Also, no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it's a candidate.

Candidate 5: O in position 4 and N in position 2: that would be _ N I O _
  - Example: ""UNION"" as above has N in position 2 and O in position 4? Actually, in ""UNION"": 
        position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N -> so yes, it has N in position2 and O in position4.

Candidate 6: O in position 4 and N in position 5: _ _ I O N -> example: ""VISION"" but that's 6 letters. ""JUMBO"" doesn't have I in the middle. ""MINOR"" has R which is excluded. ""PILOT"" has P and T which are excluded. So hard to find.

Candidate 7: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O
  - Then N must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 5 is taken by O).
  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I _ O""
      - ""NITRO"" but R and T excluded. 
      - ""NICHO"" -> not a word? 
      - ""NINJO"" -> not a word.
  - Example: if N in position 2: "" _ N I _ O""
      - ""UNCIO"" -> not a word.
      - ""ONICO"" -> not a word.

So the main candidates we have are:
  - ""ONION"": O in 1 and 4, N in 2 and 5 -> pattern: O N I O N
  - ""ODIUM"": O in 1, D in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5 -> pattern: O D I U M
  - ""UNION"": U in 1, N in 2, I in 3, O in 4, N in 5 -> pattern: U N I O N

We need to choose one that is a valid word and maximizes information.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters. We want to test new letters.

In ""ONION"": we are testing O and N again, but we already know they are in the word. We are not testing new letters for the other positions. Specifically, we are not testing any new letters in positions 1,2,4,5 because we are using O and N for multiple positions. We would only learn about the positions of O and N, but we already know they are in the word. However, we might learn if there are duplicates.

In ""ODIUM"": we are testing new letters: D, U, M. And we are putting O in position 1 (which is a new position for O) and we are not using N? But wait, we know N is in the word, but in ""ODIUM"" we don't have N. That's a problem! We must include N because the feedback from ""point"" told us that N is in the word (it was marked as present). So we cannot guess a word that does not have N.

Therefore, ""ODIUM"" is invalid because it does not contain N.

Similarly, we must include O and N.

So ""ONION"" and ""UNION"" both have O and N.

But ""ONION"" has O in position 1 and 4, and N in position 2 and 5. We know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point"") but we are putting O in 1 and 4, which are allowed. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, but in ""ONION"", N is in 2 and 5, so position 4 is O, not N. So that's okay.

In ""UNION"", we have O in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 2 and 5 (position 4 is O, so N is not in 4, which is good).

But both words have duplicate letters. We might get less information if there are duplicates.

Alternatively, can we find a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and with distinct new letters?

For example, O in position 1 and N in position 5: pattern: O _ I _ N
  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not excluded and form a word.
  - Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O in 1) and cannot be a letter that is excluded. So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Position 4: similarly.
  - Example: ""OLIVN"" -> not a word.
  - ""OBLIN"" -> not a word.
  - ""O MIN something"" -> hard.

Another possibility: O in position 1 and N in position 2: pattern: O N I _ _
  - Then we need two letters for positions 4 and 5, not excluded and form a word.
  - Example: ""ONIUM"" -> not a word? ""ONIUM"" is a chemistry term? But let's see if it's accepted. Alternatively, ""ONCET"" -> not a word and T is excluded.
  - ""ONLY"" is 4 letters.

O in position 4 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I O _
  - Example: ""N D I O M"" -> ""NDIOM"" not a word.
  - ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word.

O in position 4 and N in position 5: pattern: _ _ I O N
  - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> ""LUTION"" is not 5 letters? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is not 5.

O in position 5 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I _ O
  - Example: ""N O I D O"" -> ""NODIO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> but C and K are allowed, but ""NICKO"" not common. ""NIVEO"" not a word.

O in position 5 and N in position 2: pattern: _ N I _ O
  - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" is an organization, but is it a word? Not really. ""UNICO"" -> not a word. ""UNIFO"" not a word.

Given the difficulty, it might be that the word has duplicate letters. So we have to consider ""ONION"" or ""UNION"".

But note: in ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. So if the secret word has only one O, then one of these will be marked as absent? But the feedback for ""point"" only showed one O (because we had one O in the guess and it was marked as present). So the secret word might have exactly one O. Similarly for N: we had one N in ""point"" and it was marked present, so the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more.

But if we guess ""ONION"", which has two O's and two N's, and the secret word has only one O and one N, then we might get feedback that one O is correct and the other is absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and use new letters for the rest.

Let me try to find such a word:

Pattern: _ _ I _ _

We need to include O and N, each once, and in positions that are allowed.

Possible configurations:

1. O in 1, N in 2: then word: O N I ? ? 
   - We need two more letters. Words: ""ONION"" has two O's and two N's, so not one. ""ONCET"" is not a word. ""ONLY"" is 4 letters. ""ONKUS"" not common. ""ONIUM"" might be accepted? But let's see: ""ONIUM"" is a term in chemistry, but it's 5 letters: O-N-I-U-M. So that's O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5. And it has only one O and one N. And no R,A,S,E,P,T. So ""ONIUM"" is a candidate.

2. O in 1, N in 4: but N cannot be in 4? Because we know N is not in position 4. So invalid.

3. O in 1, N in 5: then word: O ? I ? N
   - Example: ""O M I D N"" -> not a word. ""O U I D N"" -> not a word. ""OVID"" is 4 letters. ""OLEIN"" has E and L? ""OLEIN"" is O-L-E-I-N, but E is excluded. ""ODYLN"" not a word. So hard.

4. O in 4, N in 1: word: N ? I O ?
   - Example: ""N O I O ?"" -> duplicate O? We want one O. ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word. ""N I C O L"" -> ""NICOL"" is a name? Not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not a word.

5. O in 4, N in 2: word: ? N I O ?
   - Example: ""U N I O N"" -> that's ""UNION"", which has two N's. But we want one N? Then we need a word with N only in position 2 and O in 4. Example: ""C N I O ?"" -> ""CNIOW"" not a word. ""UNIO"" is 4 letters. ""UNCO"" is 4. ""UNIOL"" not a word.

6. O in 4, N in 5: word: ? ? I O N
   - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> not 5? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is 4. ""SCION"" has S which is excluded. ""BRION"" has R and B? R is excluded. ""FLUION"" not a word.

7. O in 5, N in 1: word: N ? I ? O
   - Example: ""N U I D O"" -> ""NUIDO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> ""NICKO"" not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not 5.

8. O in 5, N in 2: word: ? N I ? O
   - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" not a word. ""U N I F O"" -> ""UNIFO"" not a word. ""UNCIO"" not a word.

So the only candidate we found with one O and one N is ""ONIUM"" (O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5). But is ""ONIUM"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""onium"" is a noun (chemistry) meaning a cation. It is accepted in word games sometimes. But to be safe, we might choose a more common word.

Alternatively, we can use ""UNION"" or ""ONION"", which are common words.

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If we guess ""UNION"":
  - Pattern: U N I O N
  - We know the secret word has I in position 3, and contains O and N (but not in position 4 for N and not in position 2 for O). In ""UNION"", we have:
        position1: U -> new letter
        position2: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know.
        position3: I -> correct
        position4: O -> we know O is in the word, but is it in position 4? We don't know.
        position5: N -> duplicate N.

  - The feedback will tell us about U, N (in two positions), and O.

But we are not sure.

Another candidate: what about ""LOVING""? But that's 6 letters.

Or ""GOING"" is 5 letters but has G and O, but no I in the third? ""GOING"" is G-O-I-N-G, so third letter is I? Yes. Pattern: G O I N G. But we have O in position 2, which we know is not allowed (because in ""point"", O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use ""GOING"" because it has O in position 2.

Another idea: ""COVIN"" -> C O V I N. But O is in position 2, which is forbidden. Not allowed.

So after careful thought, I think ""UNION"" is a good guess because it is a common word and fits the constraints.

But let's check the feedback from ""point"": O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong. In ""UNION"", we are putting O in position 4. That's allowed. And N was in position 4 in ""point"" and was wrong, but in ""UNION"" we are putting N in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is new for N, and position 5 is new.

So I'll go with ""UNION"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""UNION"" has U, N, I, O, N. Excluded are R,A,S,E,P,T. U is not excluded, so it's fine.

So guess: ""UNION""

But wait, is there a better word? What about ""MINOR""? But R is excluded. ""HINGE"" has E and H? E is excluded.

Another candidate: ""BUILT"" was considered earlier, but it has U and I, but no O or N? We must include O and N.

We must include both O and N.

So ""UNION"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""ONION"" is also good.

But let's choose ""UNION"" because it has U which is a new vowel.

So I'll guess ""UNION"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct position), S (absent), E (absent).  
  This means:  
  - The secret word has ""I"" in the third position (position 3).  
  - R, A, S, and E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""point""**  
  Feedback: P (absent), O (present but wrong position), I (correct position), N (present but wrong position), T (absent).  
  This means:  
  - O and N are in the secret word, but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4.  
  - P and T are **not** in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I _ _` (I is fixed in position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I (position 3), O, and N.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback).  
- **Position constraints for N**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must include **O** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), with O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.  
- The word must avoid R, A, S, E, P, T.  
- To maximize information, prioritize words that:  
  - Place O and N in new positions (e.g., O in positions 1, 4, or 5; N in positions 1, 2, or 5).  
  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, M, D, C) to test more of the alphabet.  
- After evaluating options (like ""ONION"", ""ODIUM"", and ""UNION""), **""UNION""** is selected because:  
  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` with I in position 3.  
  - It contains O (in position 4) and N (in positions 2 and 5), satisfying the position constraints (O not in position 2, N not in position 4).  
  - It uses new letters (U) and avoids absent letters (R, A, S, E, P, T).  
  - It is a common English word, increasing the likelihood of validity.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- The position of O (if it is in position 4).  
- The position of N (if it is in position 2 or 5).  
- Whether U is in the word and its position.

But note: we know I is in the word and in the correct position, so we can use it again? Actually, the feedback for I was correct and we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know if there are multiple I\'s. However, the feedback for the first guess showed only one I and it was correct. But we don\'t know for sure if there are duplicates. However, since we are avoiding the letters that are absent, we can try.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only showed I as present and correct, and the others as absent. So if the word had two I\'s, then the other I would have been in a different position and we would have seen a \'-\' for that? But in ""raise"", the I was in the third position and correct. If there was another I in the word, but in a different position, then we would have seen a \'-\' for that I? However, in ""raise"", there is only one I. So we don\'t know if there is another I.\n\nBut the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word. Since we only had one I and it was marked correct, and the other positions were marked absent, that means the other positions do not have I? Actually, no: the feedback for the other positions (like the first letter) was R which was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about I in the first position. The feedback for the first letter was R: absent, so the first letter is not R and also not I? Actually, the feedback for the first letter being absent only means that the letter R is not in the word, but it doesn\'t say anything about the letter I being in the first position. However, we know that the third letter is I, so if the word had an I in the first position, then when we guessed ""raise"" (which has I only in the third position) we would have seen a \'-\' for the first letter if the first letter was I? But no, because we didn\'t put I in the first position. We put R in the first position. So we have no information about whether the word has an I in a position other than the third.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the third letter was I and it was correct. That doesn\'t prevent the word from having another I. However, the feedback for the other letters (R, A, S, E) were absent, meaning that the word does not contain R, A, S, E. So if the word had an I in the first position, then when we put R in the first position, we would have gotten a \'-\' for the first letter? Actually, no: because we put R (which is absent) so we get an \'x\'. We didn\'t put I in the first position, so we don\'t know if the first letter could be I.\n\nBut wait: the feedback for the first letter was R: absent. That means the letter R is not in the word at all. So the first letter cannot be I? Actually, no: the absence of R doesn\'t say anything about I. The first letter could be I? But we have the third letter as I. So if the word has two I\'s, then we would have to consider that.\n\nHowever, we don\'t have any information about other I\'s. So we should consider that the word might have another I.\n\nBut for now, we are going to avoid the letters R, A, S, E.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has the pattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nLet\'s list some words that fit and don\'t contain R, A, S, E.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""BLIND"" -> B, L, I, N, D -> but note we have I in the third position.

But we don\'t know.\n\nWe want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, L, O, U, D, C, M, P, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern.\n\nOne good candidate is ""POINT"": \n  P, O, I, N, T -> all new letters except I (which we know is in the word). This way we test P, O, N, T.\n\nAnother candidate is ""CLINT"": but is ""CLINT"" a word? It might be a name, but we need a valid English word. ""Clint"" is a proper name and might not be accepted. Let\'s avoid.\n\n""BLIMP"": B, L, I, M, P -> but the last two letters are M and P. This is a valid word.\n\n""THING"": T, H, I, N, G -> valid.\n\n""CHILL"": C, H, I, L, L -> but has two L\'s. And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But the word is valid.\n\nBut note: we are only allowed to use 5-letter words. ""CHILL"" is 5 letters.\n\nHowever, we want to avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information? Because if we use two L\'s and the word has only one L, then we might get one \'-\' and one \'x\', which is less efficient. So it\'s better to use distinct letters.\n\nTherefore, we prefer words with distinct letters.\n\n""POINT"" has distinct letters: P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and new (except I).\n\n""BLIND"" has distinct letters: B, L, I, N, D.\n\n""THING"" has distinct letters: T, H, I, N, G.\n\n""CLING"" has distinct letters: C, L, I, N, G.\n\nWe can choose any of these.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: P, O, N, T and we already know I.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has O or not. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know the word doesn\'t have A or E, so the vowels left are I (we know), O, U. We have O in ""POINT"".\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has O. So we are testing.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T -> but the third letter is I? Actually, ""BUILT"" is B-U-I-L-T, so the third letter is I. That works. And it has U and I (vowels) and B, L, T (consonants). And distinct letters.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried U. So that\'s also good.\n\nHowever, we are going to choose ""POINT"" because it is a very common word and covers more common consonants.\n\nSo our next guess: ""POINT""\n\nBut let me double-check: we are avoiding R, A, S, E. ""POINT"" does not contain any of these.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R, A, S, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- The letter **I** is in the secret word and is in the **correct position (third letter)**.\n\nThis means the secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I _ _` and excludes the letters R, A, S, E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I must be in the third position.\n- The word should avoid R, A, S, E to test new letters.\n- I chose **""point""** because:\n  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` (with I as the third letter).\n  - It introduces new common letters: P, O, N, T (all untested so far).\n  - It uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n  - It is a valid English word.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo we know:\n  - The secret word has the letter I in the third position.\n  - The letters R, A, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""point""\n  P: x (not in the word)\n  O: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  I: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is I, which we already knew)\n  N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word contains O and N, but not in the positions we guessed.\n  - Additionally, P and T are not in the word.\n\nCurrent knowledge:\n  - Secret word pattern: _ _ I _ _\n  - Letters in the word: I (position 3 fixed), O, and N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, as per ""point"" guess).\n  - Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Has \'I\' as the third letter.\n  - Contains the letters O and N (but not in the second or fourth positions? Note: in ""point"", O was in the second position and was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in the second position. Similarly, N was in the fourth position and marked as present but wrong position, so N cannot be in the fourth position).\n  - Does not contain R, A, S, E, P, T.\n\nAlso, we have to consider the positions for O and N:\n  - O cannot be in position 2 (because in ""point"" it was in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there).\n  - N cannot be in position 4 (because in ""point"" it was in position 4 and got \'-\').\n\nThe secret word has the form: [letter1] [letter2] I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nConstraints on positions:\n  - letter2 cannot be O (because O was in position 2 and was wrong)\n  - letter4 cannot be N (because N was in position 4 and was wrong)\n\nBut note: O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? And N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5? But we have to avoid the positions that were tried and wrong.\n\nAlso, we know the word must contain both O and N.\n\nWe have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (excluding the absent ones) and satisfies the position constraints.\n\nAvailable letters: We haven\'t tried many letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded: R, A, S, E, P, T (6 letters). We have included and know are in the word: O, N, I (but I is fixed). So we can use any other letters that are not excluded.\n\nBut note: we must include O and N in the word, and they must be in positions that are not forbidden.\n\nLet\'s list the possible positions for O and N:\n\nFor O: \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" guess). \n  - Can be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nFor N:\n  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" guess).\n  - Can be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word must have both O and N, and we have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5? Actually, we have positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 to fill, but we have two letters (O and N) that must be placed in two of these positions, and the remaining two positions must be filled with other letters (not in the excluded set).\n\nExcluded letters: R, A, S, E, P, T.\n\nSo available letters: all consonants and vowels except the excluded ones. Vowels: we have O (which we know is in the word) and we have U, and sometimes Y. But we don\'t know about U and Y yet. Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word that has the pattern _ _ I _ _, contains O and N, and avoids R,A,S,E,P,T.\n\nWe should consider words that have O and N in the allowed positions.\n\nPossible positions for O: 1, 4, 5\nPossible positions for N: 1, 2, 5\n\nBut note: if we put O in position 1, then N can be in 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4 only if we are putting it in the same position as in the previous guess? Actually, the feedback for N in ""point"" was in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that in the secret word, N is present but not in position 4. So N can be in 1, 2, or 5. Similarly, O cannot be in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to think of words that fit:\n\nOption 1: O in position 1, then the word starts with O, then we have: O _ I _ _\n  - Then N must be in one of the remaining positions: 2, 4, or 5. But position 2: we can put N? Yes, because the constraint for O was only on position 2, but N can be in position 2. However, we have to check if such a word exists.\n\nOption 2: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _\n  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 5.\n\nOption 3: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O\n  - Then N can be in 1, 2, or 4? But wait, position 4 is forbidden for N? No, the constraint is that N cannot be in position 4? Actually, the feedback said N was in the word but not in position 4. So N can be in position 4? No, because if we put N in position 4, then it would be the same as the previous guess and we know it\'s not there. So N cannot be in position 4. Therefore, in this case, N must be in 1 or 2.\n\nWe need to find a valid word that satisfies one of these.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\nCandidate 1: O in position 1 and N in position 2: ""ON _ I _ _""\n  - The word would be ""ON"" + something + ""I"" + two letters. But we have to avoid R,A,S,E,P,T.\n  - Example: ""ONION"" -> but ""ONION"" has two O\'s and two N\'s? Let\'s check: O N I O N? That\'s 5 letters? O-N-I-O-N. But we have O in position 1, N in position 2, I in 3, then O in 4 and N in 5? But we have two O\'s and two N\'s. Also, the letter O is in position 1 and 4? But we know O is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be duplicated. Also, the feedback from ""point"" only showed one O and one N, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be duplicates. However, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. But ""ONION"" is a valid word. But note: in ""ONION"", the third letter is I, so it fits. But let\'s check the letters: O, N, I, O, N. We have O and N, and no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut wait: in the feedback for ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So if we guess ""ONION"", then the O in position 1 would be a new position, and the O in position 4 would be another. But we don\'t know if the word has two O\'s. Similarly, N is in position 2 and 5. But in ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was wrong, but in ""ONION"" we have N in position 2 and 5, which are different.\n\nBut we are not sure. We can try, but maybe we can find a word without duplicates to get more information.\n\nCandidate 2: O in position 1 and N in position 4: but wait, N cannot be in position 4? Because the feedback from ""point"" said N is not in position 4. So if we put N in position 4, that would be invalid because we know N is not in position 4. So that\'s not allowed.\n\nCandidate 3: O in position 1 and N in position 5: then pattern: O _ I _ N\n  - Example: ""OLIVE"" -> but E is excluded. Not allowed.\n  - ""ODIUM"" -> O D I U M. This word? ""ODIUM"" is a valid word. It means widespread hatred. Letters: O, D, I, U, M. Check: no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it\'s allowed. But note: we have U and M, which are new.\n\nCandidate 4: O in position 4: then pattern: _ _ I O _\n  - Then N must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not 4, which is taken by O). \n  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I O _""\n      - ""NIXON""? But X is allowed? ""NIXON"" is a proper name? But we need a common word. Also, it has N in position 1 and O in position 4. But the word is ""NIXON"": N-I-X-O-N. But then the third letter is X? We need the third letter to be I. So ""NIXON"" has I in the second position, not third. So not matching.\n      - ""NAIRO""? But A is excluded. Not allowed.\n      - ""LION"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n      - How about ""UNION""? U-N-I-O-N. This has: position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N. So it fits the pattern. And it has O in position 4 and N in positions 2 and 5. But note: we have N in position 2 and 5. And O in position 4. Also, no R,A,S,E,P,T. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nCandidate 5: O in position 4 and N in position 2: that would be _ N I O _\n  - Example: ""UNION"" as above has N in position 2 and O in position 4? Actually, in ""UNION"": \n        position1: U, position2: N, position3: I, position4: O, position5: N -> so yes, it has N in position2 and O in position4.\n\nCandidate 6: O in position 4 and N in position 5: _ _ I O N -> example: ""VISION"" but that\'s 6 letters. ""JUMBO"" doesn\'t have I in the middle. ""MINOR"" has R which is excluded. ""PILOT"" has P and T which are excluded. So hard to find.\n\nCandidate 7: O in position 5: then pattern: _ _ I _ O\n  - Then N must be in position 1 or 2 (since not 4, and 5 is taken by O).\n  - Example: if N in position 1: ""N _ I _ O""\n      - ""NITRO"" but R and T excluded. \n      - ""NICHO"" -> not a word? \n      - ""NINJO"" -> not a word.\n  - Example: if N in position 2: "" _ N I _ O""\n      - ""UNCIO"" -> not a word.\n      - ""ONICO"" -> not a word.\n\nSo the main candidates we have are:\n  - ""ONION"": O in 1 and 4, N in 2 and 5 -> pattern: O N I O N\n  - ""ODIUM"": O in 1, D in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5 -> pattern: O D I U M\n  - ""UNION"": U in 1, N in 2, I in 3, O in 4, N in 5 -> pattern: U N I O N\n\nWe need to choose one that is a valid word and maximizes information.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters. We want to test new letters.\n\nIn ""ONION"": we are testing O and N again, but we already know they are in the word. We are not testing new letters for the other positions. Specifically, we are not testing any new letters in positions 1,2,4,5 because we are using O and N for multiple positions. We would only learn about the positions of O and N, but we already know they are in the word. However, we might learn if there are duplicates.\n\nIn ""ODIUM"": we are testing new letters: D, U, M. And we are putting O in position 1 (which is a new position for O) and we are not using N? But wait, we know N is in the word, but in ""ODIUM"" we don\'t have N. That\'s a problem! We must include N because the feedback from ""point"" told us that N is in the word (it was marked as present). So we cannot guess a word that does not have N.\n\nTherefore, ""ODIUM"" is invalid because it does not contain N.\n\nSimilarly, we must include O and N.\n\nSo ""ONION"" and ""UNION"" both have O and N.\n\nBut ""ONION"" has O in position 1 and 4, and N in position 2 and 5. We know that O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""point"") but we are putting O in 1 and 4, which are allowed. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, but in ""ONION"", N is in 2 and 5, so position 4 is O, not N. So that\'s okay.\n\nIn ""UNION"", we have O in position 4 (allowed) and N in position 2 and 5 (position 4 is O, so N is not in 4, which is good).\n\nBut both words have duplicate letters. We might get less information if there are duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, can we find a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and with distinct new letters?\n\nFor example, O in position 1 and N in position 5: pattern: O _ I _ N\n  - We need two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not excluded and form a word.\n  - Position 2: cannot be O (but we are putting O in 1) and cannot be a letter that is excluded. So available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n  - Position 4: similarly.\n  - Example: ""OLIVN"" -> not a word.\n  - ""OBLIN"" -> not a word.\n  - ""O MIN something"" -> hard.\n\nAnother possibility: O in position 1 and N in position 2: pattern: O N I _ _\n  - Then we need two letters for positions 4 and 5, not excluded and form a word.\n  - Example: ""ONIUM"" -> not a word? ""ONIUM"" is a chemistry term? But let\'s see if it\'s accepted. Alternatively, ""ONCET"" -> not a word and T is excluded.\n  - ""ONLY"" is 4 letters.\n\nO in position 4 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I O _\n  - Example: ""N D I O M"" -> ""NDIOM"" not a word.\n  - ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word.\n\nO in position 4 and N in position 5: pattern: _ _ I O N\n  - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> ""LUTION"" is not 5 letters? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is not 5.\n\nO in position 5 and N in position 1: pattern: N _ I _ O\n  - Example: ""N O I D O"" -> ""NODIO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> but C and K are allowed, but ""NICKO"" not common. ""NIVEO"" not a word.\n\nO in position 5 and N in position 2: pattern: _ N I _ O\n  - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" is an organization, but is it a word? Not really. ""UNICO"" -> not a word. ""UNIFO"" not a word.\n\nGiven the difficulty, it might be that the word has duplicate letters. So we have to consider ""ONION"" or ""UNION"".\n\nBut note: in ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. So if the secret word has only one O, then one of these will be marked as absent? But the feedback for ""point"" only showed one O (because we had one O in the guess and it was marked as present). So the secret word might have exactly one O. Similarly for N: we had one N in ""point"" and it was marked present, so the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more.\n\nBut if we guess ""ONION"", which has two O\'s and two N\'s, and the secret word has only one O and one N, then we might get feedback that one O is correct and the other is absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has O and N only once and in the allowed positions, and use new letters for the rest.\n\nLet me try to find such a word:\n\nPattern: _ _ I _ _\n\nWe need to include O and N, each once, and in positions that are allowed.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\n1. O in 1, N in 2: then word: O N I ? ? \n   - We need two more letters. Words: ""ONION"" has two O\'s and two N\'s, so not one. ""ONCET"" is not a word. ""ONLY"" is 4 letters. ""ONKUS"" not common. ""ONIUM"" might be accepted? But let\'s see: ""ONIUM"" is a term in chemistry, but it\'s 5 letters: O-N-I-U-M. So that\'s O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5. And it has only one O and one N. And no R,A,S,E,P,T. So ""ONIUM"" is a candidate.\n\n2. O in 1, N in 4: but N cannot be in 4? Because we know N is not in position 4. So invalid.\n\n3. O in 1, N in 5: then word: O ? I ? N\n   - Example: ""O M I D N"" -> not a word. ""O U I D N"" -> not a word. ""OVID"" is 4 letters. ""OLEIN"" has E and L? ""OLEIN"" is O-L-E-I-N, but E is excluded. ""ODYLN"" not a word. So hard.\n\n4. O in 4, N in 1: word: N ? I O ?\n   - Example: ""N O I O ?"" -> duplicate O? We want one O. ""N U I O M"" -> ""NUIOM"" not a word. ""N I C O L"" -> ""NICOL"" is a name? Not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not a word.\n\n5. O in 4, N in 2: word: ? N I O ?\n   - Example: ""U N I O N"" -> that\'s ""UNION"", which has two N\'s. But we want one N? Then we need a word with N only in position 2 and O in 4. Example: ""C N I O ?"" -> ""CNIOW"" not a word. ""UNIO"" is 4 letters. ""UNCO"" is 4. ""UNIOL"" not a word.\n\n6. O in 4, N in 5: word: ? ? I O N\n   - Example: ""L U I O N"" -> not 5? ""LUCION"" not a word. ""CION"" is 4. ""SCION"" has S which is excluded. ""BRION"" has R and B? R is excluded. ""FLUION"" not a word.\n\n7. O in 5, N in 1: word: N ? I ? O\n   - Example: ""N U I D O"" -> ""NUIDO"" not a word. ""N I C K O"" -> ""NICKO"" not common. ""N I F O L"" -> not 5.\n\n8. O in 5, N in 2: word: ? N I ? O\n   - Example: ""U N I D O"" -> ""UNIDO"" not a word. ""U N I F O"" -> ""UNIFO"" not a word. ""UNCIO"" not a word.\n\nSo the only candidate we found with one O and one N is ""ONIUM"" (O in 1, N in 2, I in 3, U in 4, M in 5). But is ""ONIUM"" a valid word? According to some dictionaries, ""onium"" is a noun (chemistry) meaning a cation. It is accepted in word games sometimes. But to be safe, we might choose a more common word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""UNION"" or ""ONION"", which are common words.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get:\n\nIf we guess ""UNION"":\n  - Pattern: U N I O N\n  - We know the secret word has I in position 3, and contains O and N (but not in position 4 for N and not in position 2 for O). In ""UNION"", we have:\n        position1: U -> new letter\n        position2: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don\'t know.\n        position3: I -> correct\n        position4: O -> we know O is in the word, but is it in position 4? We don\'t know.\n        position5: N -> duplicate N.\n\n  - The feedback will tell us about U, N (in two positions), and O.\n\nBut we are not sure.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""LOVING""? But that\'s 6 letters.\n\nOr ""GOING"" is 5 letters but has G and O, but no I in the third? ""GOING"" is G-O-I-N-G, so third letter is I? Yes. Pattern: G O I N G. But we have O in position 2, which we know is not allowed (because in ""point"", O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in position 2). So we cannot use ""GOING"" because it has O in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: ""COVIN"" -> C O V I N. But O is in position 2, which is forbidden. Not allowed.\n\nSo after careful thought, I think ""UNION"" is a good guess because it is a common word and fits the constraints.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback from ""point"": O was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong. In ""UNION"", we are putting O in position 4. That\'s allowed. And N was in position 4 in ""point"" and was wrong, but in ""UNION"" we are putting N in position 2 and 5. Position 2 is new for N, and position 5 is new.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""UNION"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""UNION"" has U, N, I, O, N. Excluded are R,A,S,E,P,T. U is not excluded, so it\'s fine.\n\nSo guess: ""UNION""\n\nBut wait, is there a better word? What about ""MINOR""? But R is excluded. ""HINGE"" has E and H? E is excluded.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BUILT"" was considered earlier, but it has U and I, but no O or N? We must include O and N.\n\nWe must include both O and N.\n\nSo ""UNION"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""ONION"" is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""UNION"" because it has U which is a new vowel.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""UNION"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  \n  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct position), S (absent), E (absent).  \n  This means:  \n  - The secret word has ""I"" in the third position (position 3).  \n  - R, A, S, and E are **not** in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""point""**  \n  Feedback: P (absent), O (present but wrong position), I (correct position), N (present but wrong position), T (absent).  \n  This means:  \n  - O and N are in the secret word, but O is not in position 2, and N is not in position 4.  \n  - P and T are **not** in the word.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I _ _` (I is fixed in position 3).  \n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I (position 3), O, and N.  \n- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T.  \n- **Position constraints for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""point"" feedback).  \n- **Position constraints for N**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""point"" feedback).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The word must include **O** and **N** (since they are confirmed present), with O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.  \n- The word must avoid R, A, S, E, P, T.  \n- To maximize information, prioritize words that:  \n  - Place O and N in new positions (e.g., O in positions 1, 4, or 5; N in positions 1, 2, or 5).  \n  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., U, L, M, D, C) to test more of the alphabet.  \n- After evaluating options (like ""ONION"", ""ODIUM"", and ""UNION""), **""UNION""** is selected because:  \n  - It fits the pattern `_ _ I _ _` with I in position 3.  \n  - It contains O (in position 4) and N (in positions 2 and 5), satisfying the position constraints (O not in position 2, N not in position 4).  \n  - It uses new letters (U) and avoids absent letters (R, A, S, E, P, T).  \n  - It is a common English word, increasing the likelihood of validity.  \n\nThis guess will help clarify:  \n- The position of O (if it is in position 4).  \n- The position of N (if it is in position 2 or 5).  \n- Whether U is in the word and its position.\n\n<guess>union</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: union -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>

  N: ✓ (correct) in position 2 -> so the second letter is N.
  I: ✓ (correct) in position 3 -> already known.
  O: ✓ (correct) in position 4 -> so the fourth letter is O.
  N: ✓ (correct) in position 5 -> so the fifth letter is N.

But note: the word has two N's? The feedback shows two N's and both are correct? 
However, the secret word must be 5 letters. The feedback for ""union"" is:
  Position 1: U (absent) -> not in the word.
  Position 2: N (correct) -> so second letter is N.
  Position 3: I (correct) -> third letter is I.
  Position 4: O (correct) -> fourth letter is O.
  Position 5: N (correct) -> fifth letter is N.

So the secret word is: _ N I O N

We know the first letter is missing. We also know from previous feedback that the absent letters are: R, A, S, E, P, T, U.

So the first letter must be a letter that is not in the set {R, A, S, E, P, T, U} and also not in the set of letters we know are in the word? But we know the word has N, I, O, and the first letter must be one that we haven't eliminated.

We also know that the word has two N's (in positions 2 and 5) and one I and one O.

The first letter can be any letter except the absent ones. We have to find a valid English word of the form: [letter] N I O N

We know the absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T, U.

So the first letter must be one of the remaining consonants or vowels (but vowels: we have only O and I in the word, and we haven't tried other vowels like Y? But note, we haven't tried Y).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that starts with one of these and ends with ""NION"", i.e., the last four letters are ""NION"".

So the word is: ? N I O N

Common words: 
  ""ONION"" -> but that starts with O. But O is already in the word? We know O is in the word (in position 4) and we are allowed to have duplicates? But in ""ONION"", the first letter is O. However, we have not received any feedback that O is duplicated. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, the feedback for ""union"" had two N's and both were correct, so duplicates are allowed.

But let's check: if the word is ""ONION"", then the first letter is O. But we have O in position 4. So the word would have two O's? But in our feedback from ""point"", we had only one O marked as present (in position 2, which was wrong). And in ""union"", we have O in position 4 and it was correct. But we don't have any feedback about another O.

However, in ""union"", we had O only in position 4. So if the word is ""ONION"", then it has O in position 1 and 4. But in ""union"", we only tested O in position 4, so the O in position 1 was not tested. But we did test the first letter of ""union"" which was U (absent) and we didn't have O in position 1 in any guess.

But note: in the first guess ""raise"", we had no O. In the second guess ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present (but wrong position). In the third guess ""union"", we had O in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has an O in position 1, we wouldn't know because we never put O in position 1.

But now, for the word to be ""ONION"", the first letter is O. But we have to check if O is allowed? We don't have O in the absent list. So it's possible.

But let's see the feedback for ""union"": 
  The first letter U was absent. So the first letter of the secret word is not U. But it could be O.

However, we must consider: if the secret word is ""ONION"", then:
  - First letter: O -> we haven't tested O in position 1? But in the second guess, we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. That doesn't say anything about position 1.

But we have a problem: the feedback for ""union"" showed that the second letter is N, third is I, fourth is O, fifth is N. So the secret word ends with ""NION"". The first letter is missing.

So the word is ?NION.

Now, what are the possibilities? 
  We need a 5-letter word ending with ""NION"". 

Common words: 
  ""ONION"" -> starts with O.
  ""ANION"" -> but A is absent (from first guess). 
  ""UNION"" -> starts with U, but U is absent (from third guess). 
  ""MINION"" -> 6 letters.

Less common: 
  ""ENION"" -> not a word, and E is absent.
  ""INION"" -> I in first position? But we have I in third. ""INION"" is a word (anatomical term) but it has I in first and third? 
      I N I O N -> first letter I, second N, third I, fourth O, fifth N. 
      But we know the third letter is I, so that matches. But the first letter is I. 
      However, we have I in the word? We know I is in the third position. But we don't know if there is another I. 
      But in the first guess, we had I only in the third position and it was correct. We didn't test I in other positions. 
      So it's possible. But we have to check if I is allowed in the first position? We don't have I in the absent list.

But note: in the feedback for ""union"", the first letter was U (absent) and we didn't have I in the first position. So we don't know.

But let's check the word ""INION"": 
  It has I in the first and third positions. 
  The feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had I in the third position and correct, but we didn't have I in the first position. 
  The feedback for ""point"" had I in the third position and correct, and no other I. 
  The feedback for ""union"" had I in the third position and correct, and no other I? But in ""union"", we didn't have I in the first position. We had U in the first and I in the third. 

So if the word is ""INION"", then in the third guess ""union"", we would have:
  Position 1: U (absent) -> correct, because the first letter is I, not U.
  Position 2: N (correct) -> matches.
  Position 3: I (correct) -> matches.
  Position 4: O (correct) -> matches.
  Position 5: N (correct) -> matches.

But what about the first letter? In ""union"", we didn't test the first letter being I. So the feedback for the first letter was absent (U) which is correct because the first letter is I, not U.

But we also have to consider: does the secret word have two I's? We don't have direct evidence, but it's possible.

However, we have a constraint: the first letter must not be in the absent list. For ""INION"", the first letter is I, which is not absent (we only know I is present in the third position, but it could be elsewhere).

But we also have the feedback from the second guess ""point"": 
  In ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""INION"", the O is in position 4, which is correct. But what about the I? In ""point"", we had I in position 3 and it was correct. We didn't have I in other positions. So no conflict.

But now, we have two candidates: ""ONION"" and ""INION"". 

But we must check the absent letters:
  For ""ONION"": first letter O -> not absent.
  For ""INION"": first letter I -> not absent.

But we have more information: in the first guess, we had A absent, so the word cannot have A. In the second guess, we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So the O in position 1 is a new position, and the O in position 4 is correct. But what about the O in position 1? We never tested it. However, the feedback for the second guess said O is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about position 1. So it's allowed.

Similarly, for ""INION"", we have I in position 1 and 3. We know I is in position 3, but we don't know about position 1.

But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. But we might be able to guess the word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try to guess one of these.

But we can also think: is there another word? 

Other words ending with ""NION"": 
  ""ANION"" -> A is absent.
  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.
  ""ONION"" -> possible.
  ""INION"" -> possible.
  ""GNION"" -> not a word.
  ""MNION"" -> not a word.

So only ""ONION"" and ""INION"" are candidates.

Now, we need to choose one. 

But note: in the feedback for the second guess ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present. In ""ONION"", there is no O in position 2? The O's are in position 1 and 4. So the O that was present in ""point"" (in position 2) must be the same O that is in the word? But in ""ONION"", there is no O in position 2, so the feedback for ""point"" would have shown that O is present (because there is an O in the word) but not in position 2. That matches.

Similarly, for ""INION"", there is no O in position 2, so the same applies.

But what about the N in the second guess? In ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the N is in position 2 and 5. So there is no N in position 4, which matches. In ""INION"", the N is in position 2 and 5, so no N in position 4, which also matches.

So both are possible.

But we have to choose one. Let's see which one we can test.

We can guess ""ONION"" and see.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one and if wrong, we have two more tries.

But we can also think of a word that can distinguish between these two? 

But the only difference is the first letter: O for ""ONION"" and I for ""INION"". 

We don't have any information about the first letter. 

But we can try to guess a word that has the first letter as O or I, but we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""ONION"" directly.

But let's see the feedback we would get if we guess ""ONION"":

  If the secret word is ""ONION"":
      Position 1: O -> but we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tested O in position 1. But in the word, it is O. So it should be correct? 
          But wait, the pattern is O N I O N. 
          We would get: 
            O: ✓ (if the first letter is O, which it is in ""ONION"")
            N: ✓ (position 2)
            I: ✓ (position 3)
            O: ✓ (position 4) 
            N: ✓ (position 5)

      So all correct.

  If the secret word is ""INION"":
      Then we guess ""ONION"":
          Position 1: O -> but the secret word has I, so O is not in the word? But wait, we know O is in the word (in position 4). So the first letter O would be: 
            If the secret word has an O only in position 4, then the first letter O in ""ONION"" would be: 
                if the secret word has only one O, then the first letter O would be marked as absent? But we have O in position 4, so the first letter O is extra. 
            But the feedback for ""ONION"" would be:
                Position 1: O -> if the secret word is ""INION"", then the first letter is I, not O. And the secret word has only one O (in position 4). So the first letter O is not in the word? But wait, the secret word has an O, so if we put O in a position where it doesn't exist, it should be marked as present but wrong? But no: the feedback rules: 
                  ✓ : correct letter and position.
                  - : letter in word but wrong position.
                  x : letter not in word.

            But the secret word ""INION"" has one O (in position 4). In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. 
            For position 1: O is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an O, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 
            However, the secret word has only one O, and it is in position 4. So the O in position 1 of the guess is not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one O, and we are using one O in the guess in position 1 and one in position 4. The one in position 4 will be correct (✓). The one in position 1: since the secret word has only one O and it is already matched in position 4, the O in position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra O.

            So feedback for ""ONION"" if secret is ""INION"":
                O (position1): x (because the only O is already matched at position4)
                N (position2): ✓
                I (position3): ✓
                O (position4): ✓
                N (position5): ✓

            So we would get: x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓

            That would tell us that the first letter is wrong.

  Similarly, if we guess ""INION"" and the secret is ""ONION"", we would get:
        I (position1): x (because the secret has O, and the secret has only one I? in position3, so the I in position1 is extra and not present) -> but wait, the secret ""ONION"" has no I in position1, and the secret has one I (in position3). So the I in position1 of the guess would be absent (x) because the secret has only one I and it's in position3 (which will be matched by the I in position3 of the guess). So:
            I: x (position1)
            N: ✓ (position2)
            I: ✓ (position3) -> but wait, the guess has two I's? ""INION"" has I in position1 and position3. 
            O: ✓ (position4)
            N: ✓ (position5)

        But the feedback for the first I: absent (x) because the secret has only one I and it's in position3. The second I (position3) is correct. So feedback: x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓

  So both ""ONION"" and ""INION"" as guesses would give the same feedback pattern (x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓) if the secret is the other one.

But that doesn't help us distinguish.

We need to guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but can test the first letter.

But we know the pattern is _ N I O N. The first letter is the only unknown.

We can guess a word that has a different first letter, but that is a valid word and tests one of the possibilities.

But we have only two candidates: O and I for the first letter.

We can guess a word that has, say, a B in the first letter? But then we would get feedback that the first letter is absent, and we can then guess between O and I.

But we have two guesses left (if we are on the fourth guess, we have two more after that? Total 6 tries: we used 3, so we have 3 left).

But we can do:

  Guess 4: a word that is not ""ONION"" or ""INION"", but has a different first letter, to test if that letter is present.

But we know the first letter must be one that is not absent. We have many letters available. But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can guess ""ONION"" and if it's not correct, then we know it must be ""INION"", and we can guess that next.

Similarly, we can guess ""INION"" first.

But to save a guess, we can try to guess a word that has the first letter as a letter that is common and not tried.

But the only possibilities are ""ONION"" and ""INION"". So we have to choose one.

Let me check: is there any other word? 

  ""CNION"" -> not a word.
  ""DNION"" -> not a word.
  ""FNION"" -> not a word.
  ""GNION"" -> not a word.
  ""HNION"" -> not a word.
  ""JNION"" -> not a word.
  ""KNION"" -> not a word.
  ""LNION"" -> not a word.
  ""MNION"" -> not a word.
  ""QNION"" -> not a word.
  ""VNION"" -> not a word.
  ""WNION"" -> not a word.
  ""XNION"" -> not a word.
  ""YNION"" -> ""YNION"" is not a word. 
  ""ZNION"" -> not a word.

So only ""ONION"" and ""INION"" are valid.

Therefore, we must guess one of them.

I think ""ONION"" is more common, so I'll guess that.

But let's see: in the feedback from the second guess, we had O present, and we now know it's in position 4. But we don't know about an extra O.

Similarly, for I, we know it's in position 3, but we don't know about an extra I.

But ""ONION"" is a very common word, while ""INION"" is a scientific term. So it's more likely to be ""ONION"".

So I'll guess ""ONION"".

But note: we are in a game, and we have to make a guess.

So let's guess ""ONION"".Based on the feedback from the third guess ""union"":
- U is absent (not in the word).
- N is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- O is correct in position 4.
- N is correct in position 5.

This reveals the secret word pattern: `_ N I O N` (second letter N, third I, fourth O, fifth N). The first letter is unknown.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with ""NION"" (positions 2-5: N, I, O, N).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T, U (from previous feedback).
- The first letter must be a letter not in the absent list and must form a valid English word.

### Candidate Words:
After evaluating possible words fitting `_NION`:
- **""ONION""**: Starts with O. Common word.
- **""INION""**: Starts with I. Anatomical term (less common).
- Other combinations (e.g., ANION, UNION) are invalid due to absent letters (A, U).

### Decision:
- ""ONION"" is selected as the next guess because:
  - It is a high-frequency word.
  - It tests the first letter (O) and aligns with the pattern.
  - If incorrect, ""INION"" can be guessed next (only two candidates exist).

<guess>onion</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct), S (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""point""**  
  Feedback: P (absent), O (present, wrong position), I (correct), N (present, wrong position), T (absent).  
- **Guess 3: ""union""**  
  Feedback: U (absent), N (correct), I (correct), O (correct), N (correct).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ N I O N`  
   - Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as **N**, **I**, **O**, and **N** respectively.  
   - Only the first letter (position 1) is unknown.  
2. **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T, U (cannot be in the word).  
3. **Valid first-letter candidates**: Must be a letter not in the absent set (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a real English word.  
4. **Possible words**:  
   - **""ONION""** (common word, starts with O).  
   - **""INION""** (less common, starts with I; anatomical term).  
   - No other valid English words fit the pattern `_NION` without using absent letters.  

### Strategy:
- Guess **""ONION""** because:  
  - It is a high-frequency word.  
  - It tests the most plausible candidate (O) for position 1.  
  - If incorrect, ""INION"" can be guessed next (only two candidates exist).  

<guess>onion</guess>",onion,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""union"":
  U: x (absent) -> so U is not in the word.
  N: ✓ (correct) in position 2 -> so the second letter is N.
  I: ✓ (correct) in position 3 -> already known.
  O: ✓ (correct) in position 4 -> so the fourth letter is O.
  N: ✓ (correct) in position 5 -> so the fifth letter is N.

But note: the word has two N's? The feedback shows two N's and both are correct? 
However, the secret word must be 5 letters. The feedback for ""union"" is:
  Position 1: U (absent) -> not in the word.
  Position 2: N (correct) -> so second letter is N.
  Position 3: I (correct) -> third letter is I.
  Position 4: O (correct) -> fourth letter is O.
  Position 5: N (correct) -> fifth letter is N.

So the secret word is: _ N I O N

We know the first letter is missing. We also know from previous feedback that the absent letters are: R, A, S, E, P, T, U.

So the first letter must be a letter that is not in the set {R, A, S, E, P, T, U} and also not in the set of letters we know are in the word? But we know the word has N, I, O, and the first letter must be one that we haven't eliminated.

We also know that the word has two N's (in positions 2 and 5) and one I and one O.

The first letter can be any letter except the absent ones. We have to find a valid English word of the form: [letter] N I O N

We know the absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T, U.

So the first letter must be one of the remaining consonants or vowels (but vowels: we have only O and I in the word, and we haven't tried other vowels like Y? But note, we haven't tried Y).

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that starts with one of these and ends with ""NION"", i.e., the last four letters are ""NION"".

So the word is: ? N I O N

Common words: 
  ""ONION"" -> but that starts with O. But O is already in the word? We know O is in the word (in position 4) and we are allowed to have duplicates? But in ""ONION"", the first letter is O. However, we have not received any feedback that O is duplicated. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, the feedback for ""union"" had two N's and both were correct, so duplicates are allowed.

But let's check: if the word is ""ONION"", then the first letter is O. But we have O in position 4. So the word would have two O's? But in our feedback from ""point"", we had only one O marked as present (in position 2, which was wrong). And in ""union"", we have O in position 4 and it was correct. But we don't have any feedback about another O.

However, in ""union"", we had O only in position 4. So if the word is ""ONION"", then it has O in position 1 and 4. But in ""union"", we only tested O in position 4, so the O in position 1 was not tested. But we did test the first letter of ""union"" which was U (absent) and we didn't have O in position 1 in any guess.

But note: in the first guess ""raise"", we had no O. In the second guess ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present (but wrong position). In the third guess ""union"", we had O in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has an O in position 1, we wouldn't know because we never put O in position 1.

But now, for the word to be ""ONION"", the first letter is O. But we have to check if O is allowed? We don't have O in the absent list. So it's possible.

But let's see the feedback for ""union"": 
  The first letter U was absent. So the first letter of the secret word is not U. But it could be O.

However, we must consider: if the secret word is ""ONION"", then:
  - First letter: O -> we haven't tested O in position 1? But in the second guess, we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. That doesn't say anything about position 1.

But we have a problem: the feedback for ""union"" showed that the second letter is N, third is I, fourth is O, fifth is N. So the secret word ends with ""NION"". The first letter is missing.

So the word is ?NION.

Now, what are the possibilities? 
  We need a 5-letter word ending with ""NION"". 

Common words: 
  ""ONION"" -> starts with O.
  ""ANION"" -> but A is absent (from first guess). 
  ""UNION"" -> starts with U, but U is absent (from third guess). 
  ""MINION"" -> 6 letters.

Less common: 
  ""ENION"" -> not a word, and E is absent.
  ""INION"" -> I in first position? But we have I in third. ""INION"" is a word (anatomical term) but it has I in first and third? 
      I N I O N -> first letter I, second N, third I, fourth O, fifth N. 
      But we know the third letter is I, so that matches. But the first letter is I. 
      However, we have I in the word? We know I is in the third position. But we don't know if there is another I. 
      But in the first guess, we had I only in the third position and it was correct. We didn't test I in other positions. 
      So it's possible. But we have to check if I is allowed in the first position? We don't have I in the absent list.

But note: in the feedback for ""union"", the first letter was U (absent) and we didn't have I in the first position. So we don't know.

But let's check the word ""INION"": 
  It has I in the first and third positions. 
  The feedback for the first guess ""raise"" had I in the third position and correct, but we didn't have I in the first position. 
  The feedback for ""point"" had I in the third position and correct, and no other I. 
  The feedback for ""union"" had I in the third position and correct, and no other I? But in ""union"", we didn't have I in the first position. We had U in the first and I in the third. 

So if the word is ""INION"", then in the third guess ""union"", we would have:
  Position 1: U (absent) -> correct, because the first letter is I, not U.
  Position 2: N (correct) -> matches.
  Position 3: I (correct) -> matches.
  Position 4: O (correct) -> matches.
  Position 5: N (correct) -> matches.

But what about the first letter? In ""union"", we didn't test the first letter being I. So the feedback for the first letter was absent (U) which is correct because the first letter is I, not U.

But we also have to consider: does the secret word have two I's? We don't have direct evidence, but it's possible.

However, we have a constraint: the first letter must not be in the absent list. For ""INION"", the first letter is I, which is not absent (we only know I is present in the third position, but it could be elsewhere).

But we also have the feedback from the second guess ""point"": 
  In ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""INION"", the O is in position 4, which is correct. But what about the I? In ""point"", we had I in position 3 and it was correct. We didn't have I in other positions. So no conflict.

But now, we have two candidates: ""ONION"" and ""INION"". 

But we must check the absent letters:
  For ""ONION"": first letter O -> not absent.
  For ""INION"": first letter I -> not absent.

But we have more information: in the first guess, we had A absent, so the word cannot have A. In the second guess, we had O in position 2 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the O is in position 1 and 4. So the O in position 1 is a new position, and the O in position 4 is correct. But what about the O in position 1? We never tested it. However, the feedback for the second guess said O is in the word but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about position 1. So it's allowed.

Similarly, for ""INION"", we have I in position 1 and 3. We know I is in position 3, but we don't know about position 1.

But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. But we might be able to guess the word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try to guess one of these.

But we can also think: is there another word? 

Other words ending with ""NION"": 
  ""ANION"" -> A is absent.
  ""UNION"" -> U is absent.
  ""ONION"" -> possible.
  ""INION"" -> possible.
  ""GNION"" -> not a word.
  ""MNION"" -> not a word.

So only ""ONION"" and ""INION"" are candidates.

Now, we need to choose one. 

But note: in the feedback for the second guess ""point"", we had O in position 2 and it was present. In ""ONION"", there is no O in position 2? The O's are in position 1 and 4. So the O that was present in ""point"" (in position 2) must be the same O that is in the word? But in ""ONION"", there is no O in position 2, so the feedback for ""point"" would have shown that O is present (because there is an O in the word) but not in position 2. That matches.

Similarly, for ""INION"", there is no O in position 2, so the same applies.

But what about the N in the second guess? In ""point"", we had N in position 4 and it was present but wrong. In ""ONION"", the N is in position 2 and 5. So there is no N in position 4, which matches. In ""INION"", the N is in position 2 and 5, so no N in position 4, which also matches.

So both are possible.

But we have to choose one. Let's see which one we can test.

We can guess ""ONION"" and see.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one and if wrong, we have two more tries.

But we can also think of a word that can distinguish between these two? 

But the only difference is the first letter: O for ""ONION"" and I for ""INION"". 

We don't have any information about the first letter. 

But we can try to guess a word that has the first letter as O or I, but we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""ONION"" directly.

But let's see the feedback we would get if we guess ""ONION"":

  If the secret word is ""ONION"":
      Position 1: O -> but we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tested O in position 1. But in the word, it is O. So it should be correct? 
          But wait, the pattern is O N I O N. 
          We would get: 
            O: ✓ (if the first letter is O, which it is in ""ONION"")
            N: ✓ (position 2)
            I: ✓ (position 3)
            O: ✓ (position 4) 
            N: ✓ (position 5)

      So all correct.

  If the secret word is ""INION"":
      Then we guess ""ONION"":
          Position 1: O -> but the secret word has I, so O is not in the word? But wait, we know O is in the word (in position 4). So the first letter O would be: 
            If the secret word has an O only in position 4, then the first letter O in ""ONION"" would be: 
                if the secret word has only one O, then the first letter O would be marked as absent? But we have O in position 4, so the first letter O is extra. 
            But the feedback for ""ONION"" would be:
                Position 1: O -> if the secret word is ""INION"", then the first letter is I, not O. And the secret word has only one O (in position 4). So the first letter O is not in the word? But wait, the secret word has an O, so if we put O in a position where it doesn't exist, it should be marked as present but wrong? But no: the feedback rules: 
                  ✓ : correct letter and position.
                  - : letter in word but wrong position.
                  x : letter not in word.

            But the secret word ""INION"" has one O (in position 4). In ""ONION"", we have O in position 1 and 4. 
            For position 1: O is not in the secret word? But the secret word has an O, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 
            However, the secret word has only one O, and it is in position 4. So the O in position 1 of the guess is not in the word? Actually, no: the secret word has one O, and we are using one O in the guess in position 1 and one in position 4. The one in position 4 will be correct (✓). The one in position 1: since the secret word has only one O and it is already matched in position 4, the O in position 1 would be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra O.

            So feedback for ""ONION"" if secret is ""INION"":
                O (position1): x (because the only O is already matched at position4)
                N (position2): ✓
                I (position3): ✓
                O (position4): ✓
                N (position5): ✓

            So we would get: x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓

            That would tell us that the first letter is wrong.

  Similarly, if we guess ""INION"" and the secret is ""ONION"", we would get:
        I (position1): x (because the secret has O, and the secret has only one I? in position3, so the I in position1 is extra and not present) -> but wait, the secret ""ONION"" has no I in position1, and the secret has one I (in position3). So the I in position1 of the guess would be absent (x) because the secret has only one I and it's in position3 (which will be matched by the I in position3 of the guess). So:
            I: x (position1)
            N: ✓ (position2)
            I: ✓ (position3) -> but wait, the guess has two I's? ""INION"" has I in position1 and position3. 
            O: ✓ (position4)
            N: ✓ (position5)

        But the feedback for the first I: absent (x) because the secret has only one I and it's in position3. The second I (position3) is correct. So feedback: x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓

  So both ""ONION"" and ""INION"" as guesses would give the same feedback pattern (x ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓) if the secret is the other one.

But that doesn't help us distinguish.

We need to guess a word that is not necessarily the solution but can test the first letter.

But we know the pattern is _ N I O N. The first letter is the only unknown.

We can guess a word that has a different first letter, but that is a valid word and tests one of the possibilities.

But we have only two candidates: O and I for the first letter.

We can guess a word that has, say, a B in the first letter? But then we would get feedback that the first letter is absent, and we can then guess between O and I.

But we have two guesses left (if we are on the fourth guess, we have two more after that? Total 6 tries: we used 3, so we have 3 left).

But we can do:

  Guess 4: a word that is not ""ONION"" or ""INION"", but has a different first letter, to test if that letter is present.

But we know the first letter must be one that is not absent. We have many letters available. But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can guess ""ONION"" and if it's not correct, then we know it must be ""INION"", and we can guess that next.

Similarly, we can guess ""INION"" first.

But to save a guess, we can try to guess a word that has the first letter as a letter that is common and not tried.

But the only possibilities are ""ONION"" and ""INION"". So we have to choose one.

Let me check: is there any other word? 

  ""CNION"" -> not a word.
  ""DNION"" -> not a word.
  ""FNION"" -> not a word.
  ""GNION"" -> not a word.
  ""HNION"" -> not a word.
  ""JNION"" -> not a word.
  ""KNION"" -> not a word.
  ""LNION"" -> not a word.
  ""MNION"" -> not a word.
  ""QNION"" -> not a word.
  ""VNION"" -> not a word.
  ""WNION"" -> not a word.
  ""XNION"" -> not a word.
  ""YNION"" -> ""YNION"" is not a word. 
  ""ZNION"" -> not a word.

So only ""ONION"" and ""INION"" are valid.

Therefore, we must guess one of them.

I think ""ONION"" is more common, so I'll guess that.

But let's see: in the feedback from the second guess, we had O present, and we now know it's in position 4. But we don't know about an extra O.

Similarly, for I, we know it's in position 3, but we don't know about an extra I.

But ""ONION"" is a very common word, while ""INION"" is a scientific term. So it's more likely to be ""ONION"".

So I'll guess ""ONION"".

But note: we are in a game, and we have to make a guess.

So let's guess ""ONION"".Based on the feedback from the third guess ""union"":
- U is absent (not in the word).
- N is correct in position 2.
- I is correct in position 3.
- O is correct in position 4.
- N is correct in position 5.

This reveals the secret word pattern: `_ N I O N` (second letter N, third I, fourth O, fifth N). The first letter is unknown.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with ""NION"" (positions 2-5: N, I, O, N).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T, U (from previous feedback).
- The first letter must be a letter not in the absent list and must form a valid English word.

### Candidate Words:
After evaluating possible words fitting `_NION`:
- **""ONION""**: Starts with O. Common word.
- **""INION""**: Starts with I. Anatomical term (less common).
- Other combinations (e.g., ANION, UNION) are invalid due to absent letters (A, U).

### Decision:
- ""ONION"" is selected as the next guess because:
  - It is a high-frequency word.
  - It tests the first letter (O) and aligns with the pattern.
  - If incorrect, ""INION"" can be guessed next (only two candidates exist).

<guess>onion</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R (absent), A (absent), I (correct), S (absent), E (absent).  
- **Guess 2: ""point""**  
  Feedback: P (absent), O (present, wrong position), I (correct), N (present, wrong position), T (absent).  
- **Guess 3: ""union""**  
  Feedback: U (absent), N (correct), I (correct), O (correct), N (correct).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ N I O N`  
   - Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed as **N**, **I**, **O**, and **N** respectively.  
   - Only the first letter (position 1) is unknown.  
2. **Absent letters**: R, A, S, E, P, T, U (cannot be in the word).  
3. **Valid first-letter candidates**: Must be a letter not in the absent set (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a real English word.  
4. **Possible words**:  
   - **""ONION""** (common word, starts with O).  
   - **""INION""** (less common, starts with I; anatomical term).  
   - No other valid English words fit the pattern `_NION` without using absent letters.  

### Strategy:
- Guess **""ONION""** because:  
  - It is a high-frequency word.  
  - It tests the most plausible candidate (O) for position 1.  
  - If incorrect, ""INION"" can be guessed next (only two candidates exist).",Guess 4: onion -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
