We are about to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get. This typically means choosing a word that has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A commonly used starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). But note we might choose alternatives that avoid repeating letters and cover more common letters.

Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives a good mix.

However, let me check the rules: we are not restricted to any specific dictionary, so we can choose any valid English word.

Idea: We want to cover letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

According to English letter frequency, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

So let's try to pick a word that includes as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Example: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative net earnings of a company) is sometimes used, but it might be obscure.

""RAISE"" is a common starting word: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 common letters.

""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E -> also good.

But ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E -> also common.

Given that we don't want to leave out S and L which are in the top 10, perhaps ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E -> less coverage of the top letters? Actually, E, A, R are in the top 5, and N is common too.

But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence of letters and whether they are in the correct position.

Since it's the first guess, any of these would work. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, I, E (three vowels) and two consonants R and S, which are very common.

But let's confirm: R, A, I, S, E -> all different.

We are allowed 6 tries, so even if we don't hit any, we will have eliminated several letters.

Alternatively, some people like to use ""WEARY"" but W and Y are less common.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first guess.

Therefore, I will go with ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. This involves selecting a word with common letters and a diverse letter set to cover more possibilities. 

Analysis:
- Common letters in 5-letter words (based on frequency): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.
- A strong first guess should include several of these letters without repeating any to increase the chance of revealing useful feedback.
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""RAISE"" are often recommended as starting words because they cover a good spread of vowels and consonants.
- I chose ""RAISE"" as it uses five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. This combination covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). It hits six of the top ten frequent letters and provides broad coverage to help narrow down the secret word based on feedback.

This guess will yield feedback that indicates:
- Which letters are present and in the correct position (✓)
- Which letters are present but incorrect position (-)
- Which letters are absent (x)

This information will guide subsequent guesses.

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the word.
A(x) - A is not in the word.
I(✓) - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since R=position1, A=2, I=3, S=4, E=5).
S(x) - S is not in the word.
E(x) - E is not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The letter I is present and it's in the third position. So the secret word has the form: _ _ I _ _ 
- R, A, S, E are absent. So they are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word containing an 'I' in the third position, and without using R, A, S, E.

Given the constraints:
- Position 3 must be 'I'.
- We must avoid R, A, S, E.

We want to try to cover other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters still available: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Since many vowels are ruled out (A, E are out, and we have I only), we might consider other vowels or consonants.

We know the word has an I in the third position, so to maximize information, we can try a word that uses common consonants in the other positions.

For example, we could try words ending with I, such as _ _ I _ _

Possible letters for position 1: We can use T, O, C, N, P, L, M, etc.

We also want to avoid repeating letters we know are absent (R, A, S, E) and we don't know about others yet.

Let me think of some words that fit: 
- Ending with I: but note, position 3 is I, so the word has I in the middle.
Common patterns: 

Let's list words that have 'I' as the third letter.

Some examples:
- SKIMP: but S is absent, so skip any with S.
- BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> no A, R, S, E? B, L, M, P are allowed.
- CHINK: C, H, I, N, K
- THING: T, H, I, N, G
- CLING: C, L, I, N, G
- FLING: F, L, I, N, G
- TIGHT: T, I, G, H, T - wait, this has two T's? Also, I is at position 2? No, we need I at position 3.

Position 3 must be I, so the word pattern is: _ _ I _ _

THING: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> valid? THING is a word.
Similarly, CHINK: 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-K -> valid? CHINK might be sensitive, better avoid.
FLINT: but N is at position 4? FLINT: F-L-I-N-T, so positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T -> that works, and no R,A,S,E.

But FLINT: does it avoid the absent letters? F, L, I, N, T. I is already known. R,A,S,E absent, so F,L,N,T are new.

Similarly, words like POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T.

But O is a vowel, and we might cover common letters.

Another one: MOIST? But S is absent, so cannot use.

We must avoid S.

Another: JOINT? J is less common.

Alternatively, we can try words that might test other vowels: like OU or U, but U is less common.

Since I is fixed at position 3, and the word has five positions, we can focus on common letters for the other positions.

Let me pick a word that covers many of the remaining common consonants and vowels.

For example, include O, T, N, L.

Possible word: POINT: P-O-I-N-T. This uses P, O, N, T (with I in the middle).

However, P is moderately common, O is vowel, N and T are common.

Other options: FLINT, as above.

JOINT is J-O-I-N-T, J not so common.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D -> position 3 I, and avoids R,A,S,E? B,L,N,D. Good.

BLIND: letters B, L, I, N, D.

Or CLING: C-L-I-N-G.

Now, which one to choose? We might want to use a word that has letters that are frequently used to get more feedback.

Also, note that in FLINT or POINT, we have a T at the end, which is common.

Similarly, THING has T at the start and G at the end.

I think POINT is a good candidate: it uses P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5 respectively.

It has no repeated letters, and O, T, N are very common.

Alternatively, if we think the word might have a U or another vowel, but we don't have much to go on.

But we already have I, and A and E are eliminated, so the vowel pool is narrowed. Possible vowels left: O, U, and sometimes Y.

But Y is less likely without E.

So let's go with POINT.

Thus, second guess: POINT.

But note: In the feedback for RAISE, I was correct in position 3, so in POINT, I is at position 3 again, which should be correct, so we'll expect I(✓) again.

Other letters: P, O, N, T are new, and we'll see if they are present and in the right positions.

This should give us new information.

We can also consider: if there was another common letter pattern.

Another word: BUILD? But U is at position 2 and position 3 is I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> position 3 I? U is position 2, I position 3? BUILD: 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D -> that works.

But U might be less common. POINT seems more balanced.

I'll go with POINT.

But let me check if POINT is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: POINT
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"":  
- R, A, S, E are absent (x) → **Cannot use R, A, S, or E again.**  
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) → **The secret word has 'I' as the third letter (pattern: _ _ I _ _).**  

To maximize information for the second guess:  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, S, E).  
- Test other common letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, P).  
- Focus on words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _, using distinct new letters to cover more possibilities.  

I choose **""POINT""** because:  
- Includes common letters (O, T, N, P).  
- Fits the known pattern: P in position 1, O in 2, I (correct) in 3, N in 4, T in 5.  
- Avoids eliminated letters (no R, A, S, E).  

This guess tests whether O, T, N, or P exist in the word and their positions, helping narrow down options significantly.

It has no repeated letters, and O, T, N are very common.

Alternatively, if we think the word might have a U or another vowel, but we don't have much to go on.

But we already have I, and A and E are eliminated, so the vowel pool is narrowed. Possible vowels left: O, U, and sometimes Y.

But Y is less likely without E.

So let's go with POINT.

Thus, second guess: POINT.

But note: In the feedback for RAISE, I was correct in position 3, so in POINT, I is at position 3 again, which should be correct, so we'll expect I(✓) again.

Other letters: P, O, N, T are new, and we'll see if they are present and in the right positions.

This should give us new information.

We can also consider: if there was another common letter pattern.

Another word: BUILD? But U is at position 2 and position 3 is I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> position 3 I? U is position 2, I position 3? BUILD: 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D -> that works.

But U might be less common. POINT seems more balanced.

I'll go with POINT.

But let me check if POINT is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: POINTBased on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"":  
- R, A, S, E are absent (x) → **Cannot use R, A, S, or E again.**  
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) → **The secret word has 'I' as the third letter (pattern: _ _ I _ _).**  

To maximize information for the second guess:  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, S, E).  
- Test other common letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, P).  
- Focus on words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _, using distinct new letters to cover more possibilities.  

I choose **""POINT""** because:  
- Includes common letters (O, T, N, P).  
- Fits the known pattern: P in position 1, O in 2, I (correct) in 3, N in 4, T in 5.  
- Avoids eliminated letters (no R, A, S, E).  

This guess tests whether O, T, N, or P exist in the word and their positions, helping narrow down options significantly.",Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are about to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get. This typically means choosing a word that has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A commonly used starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). But note we might choose alternatives that avoid repeating letters and cover more common letters.

Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives a good mix.

However, let me check the rules: we are not restricted to any specific dictionary, so we can choose any valid English word.

Idea: We want to cover letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

According to English letter frequency, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

So let's try to pick a word that includes as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Example: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative net earnings of a company) is sometimes used, but it might be obscure.

""RAISE"" is a common starting word: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 common letters.

""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E -> also good.

But ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E -> also common.

Given that we don't want to leave out S and L which are in the top 10, perhaps ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E -> less coverage of the top letters? Actually, E, A, R are in the top 5, and N is common too.

But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence of letters and whether they are in the correct position.

Since it's the first guess, any of these would work. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, I, E (three vowels) and two consonants R and S, which are very common.

But let's confirm: R, A, I, S, E -> all different.

We are allowed 6 tries, so even if we don't hit any, we will have eliminated several letters.

Alternatively, some people like to use ""WEARY"" but W and Y are less common.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first guess.

Therefore, I will go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. This involves selecting a word with common letters and a diverse letter set to cover more possibilities. 

Analysis:
- Common letters in 5-letter words (based on frequency): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.
- A strong first guess should include several of these letters without repeating any to increase the chance of revealing useful feedback.
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""RAISE"" are often recommended as starting words because they cover a good spread of vowels and consonants.
- I chose ""RAISE"" as it uses five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. This combination covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). It hits six of the top ten frequent letters and provides broad coverage to help narrow down the secret word based on feedback.

This guess will yield feedback that indicates:
- Which letters are present and in the correct position (✓)
- Which letters are present but incorrect position (-)
- Which letters are absent (x)

This information will guide subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the word.
A(x) - A is not in the word.
I(✓) - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since R=position1, A=2, I=3, S=4, E=5).
S(x) - S is not in the word.
E(x) - E is not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The letter I is present and it's in the third position. So the secret word has the form: _ _ I _ _ 
- R, A, S, E are absent. So they are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word containing an 'I' in the third position, and without using R, A, S, E.

Given the constraints:
- Position 3 must be 'I'.
- We must avoid R, A, S, E.

We want to try to cover other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters still available: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Since many vowels are ruled out (A, E are out, and we have I only), we might consider other vowels or consonants.

We know the word has an I in the third position, so to maximize information, we can try a word that uses common consonants in the other positions.

For example, we could try words ending with I, such as _ _ I _ _

Possible letters for position 1: We can use T, O, C, N, P, L, M, etc.

We also want to avoid repeating letters we know are absent (R, A, S, E) and we don't know about others yet.

Let me think of some words that fit: 
- Ending with I: but note, position 3 is I, so the word has I in the middle.
Common patterns: 

Let's list words that have 'I' as the third letter.

Some examples:
- SKIMP: but S is absent, so skip any with S.
- BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> no A, R, S, E? B, L, M, P are allowed.
- CHINK: C, H, I, N, K
- THING: T, H, I, N, G
- CLING: C, L, I, N, G
- FLING: F, L, I, N, G
- TIGHT: T, I, G, H, T - wait, this has two T's? Also, I is at position 2? No, we need I at position 3.

Position 3 must be I, so the word pattern is: _ _ I _ _

THING: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> valid? THING is a word.
Similarly, CHINK: 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-K -> valid? CHINK might be sensitive, better avoid.
FLINT: but N is at position 4? FLINT: F-L-I-N-T, so positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T -> that works, and no R,A,S,E.

But FLINT: does it avoid the absent letters? F, L, I, N, T. I is already known. R,A,S,E absent, so F,L,N,T are new.

Similarly, words like POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T.

But O is a vowel, and we might cover common letters.

Another one: MOIST? But S is absent, so cannot use.

We must avoid S.

Another: JOINT? J is less common.

Alternatively, we can try words that might test other vowels: like OU or U, but U is less common.

Since I is fixed at position 3, and the word has five positions, we can focus on common letters for the other positions.

Let me pick a word that covers many of the remaining common consonants and vowels.

For example, include O, T, N, L.

Possible word: POINT: P-O-I-N-T. This uses P, O, N, T (with I in the middle).

However, P is moderately common, O is vowel, N and T are common.

Other options: FLINT, as above.

JOINT is J-O-I-N-T, J not so common.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D -> position 3 I, and avoids R,A,S,E? B,L,N,D. Good.

BLIND: letters B, L, I, N, D.

Or CLING: C-L-I-N-G.

Now, which one to choose? We might want to use a word that has letters that are frequently used to get more feedback.

Also, note that in FLINT or POINT, we have a T at the end, which is common.

Similarly, THING has T at the start and G at the end.

I think POINT is a good candidate: it uses P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5 respectively.

It has no repeated letters, and O, T, N are very common.

Alternatively, if we think the word might have a U or another vowel, but we don't have much to go on.

But we already have I, and A and E are eliminated, so the vowel pool is narrowed. Possible vowels left: O, U, and sometimes Y.

But Y is less likely without E.

So let's go with POINT.

Thus, second guess: POINT.

But note: In the feedback for RAISE, I was correct in position 3, so in POINT, I is at position 3 again, which should be correct, so we'll expect I(✓) again.

Other letters: P, O, N, T are new, and we'll see if they are present and in the right positions.

This should give us new information.

We can also consider: if there was another common letter pattern.

Another word: BUILD? But U is at position 2 and position 3 is I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> position 3 I? U is position 2, I position 3? BUILD: 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D -> that works.

But U might be less common. POINT seems more balanced.

I'll go with POINT.

But let me check if POINT is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: POINTBased on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"":  
- R, A, S, E are absent (x) → **Cannot use R, A, S, or E again.**  
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) → **The secret word has 'I' as the third letter (pattern: _ _ I _ _).**  

To maximize information for the second guess:  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, S, E).  
- Test other common letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, P).  
- Focus on words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _, using distinct new letters to cover more possibilities.  

I choose **""POINT""** because:  
- Includes common letters (O, T, N, P).  
- Fits the known pattern: P in position 1, O in 2, I (correct) in 3, N in 4, T in 5.  
- Avoids eliminated letters (no R, A, S, E).  

This guess tests whether O, T, N, or P exist in the word and their positions, helping narrow down options significantly.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. **RAISE**: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. **POINT**: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is still correct in position 3 (we knew that).
     - 'N' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
     - 'O' is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's not in position 2).
     - P and T are not in the word.

From this, we can deduce:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ 
  - Position 3: I (fixed)
  - Position 4: N (fixed)
- Additionally, the word contains the letter 'O', but not in position 2 (and since position 4 is N, O must be in position 1, 5, or possibly 2 but we know it's not in 2 from POINT feedback, so actually position 1 or 5).
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T. So we cannot use these.

We also know the word must have an 'O' in it (from the '-' feedback for O in POINT), and it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N).

So the pattern is: [position1] [position2] I N [position5]

And we know:
- Position1: can be O or another letter (but if it's not O, then O must be in position5)
- Position2: cannot be O (from POINT feedback), and must be a letter not in the absent list.
- Position5: similarly, must be a letter not absent, and if O is not in position1, it must be here.

Also, the word must contain at least one 'O' (since it's present but misplaced).

Now, we need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ 

With the constraints:
- Contains O (in position 1 or 5)
- Does not contain: R, A, S, E, P, T

We can list possible letters for the remaining positions. The alphabet without the absent letters: 
B, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used in position 3, and we don't know if it can repeat? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't seen any repetition yet. However, we must consider the possibility. But note: in POINT, we had I and N, and they were both present, but in the secret word, we have I and N fixed. The feedback for O was '-' meaning it's present but not in position 2, but it doesn't tell us if there are multiple O's. However, for now, let's assume no repetition until we have evidence.

But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know. But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

However, since we have limited guesses, we might try to avoid repetition for now.

So, for position1: possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, O, and also U, V, W, Y, Z, but less common. But we have O as a strong candidate because we know O is in the word.

Similarly, position2: cannot be O, and must be from the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, U, V, W, Y, Z (and not the absent ones).

Position5: same as position1, but note that if position1 is O, then position5 cannot be O (if we assume no repetition, but we don't know). But the feedback doesn't indicate multiple O's, so we can try without repetition first.

Now, let's think of words that end with IN? Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the last two are fixed as I and N? No: positions 3 and 4 are I and N, so the word ends with the fourth letter as N, and then the fifth letter is unknown. So the word is of the form: [1][2] I N [5]

Common words: 
- If the fifth letter is G, then it could be ""something"" ING, like BRING, but B is allowed, but we have R absent? R is absent, so BRING is out. Similarly, THING: T is absent. FLING: F is allowed, L is allowed, but we have to check.

But let's list possible words:

We know the word must have an O. So the O must be in position 1 or 5.

Case 1: O in position 1.
Then the word is: O [2] I N [5]
Position2: cannot be O (we know), and must be a consonant or vowel? But we have few vowels left: U or Y? Because A, E, I (I is at position3) are out. So position2 must be a consonant.

Possible words: 
- OMIN? But that's 4 letters, we need 5: O _ I N _ 
  Examples: 
  - OMEN? But E is absent.
  - OVINE: O V I N E -> but E is absent, so no.
  - OMINA? But that's 5 letters: O M I N A -> but A is absent.
  - OUNCE? O U N C E -> but positions: O at1, U at2, N at3? But we need position3 to be I, not N. So no.

We need position3 to be I and position4 to be N. So the word must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So for O at position1: O [2] I N [5]

What can [2] be? It must be a letter that forms a word with O and then IN. Examples:
- JOIN? But J O I N -> that's 4 letters. We need 5: so it must be JOIN followed by something? No, 5-letter word.

5-letter words starting with O and having I at position3 and N at position4:
- OBANG? Not a common word.
- OCHIN? Not common.
- OMINA? O-M-I-N-A, but A is absent.
- OVINE: O-V-I-N-E, but E is absent.

I'm struggling. Maybe O at position1 is not common.

Case 2: O in position5.
Then the word is: [1] [2] I N O

So it ends with INO? Like words ending in INO: but that's usually for names or specific words.

Examples:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: 
  - CASINO? But C-A-S-I-N-O -> positions: C1, A2, S3? But we need I at position3 and N at4. Here, S is at3? No, and S is absent.
  - We need [1][2] I N O, so the last three are I, N, O.

Words: 
- BINGO? B-I-N-G-O -> positions: B1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.
- We need: position1: ?, position2: ?, position3: I, position4: N, position5: O.

So the word ends with ""INO"".

Examples of 5-letter words ending with INO:
- CONDO: C-O-N-D-O -> positions: C1, O2, N3, D4, O5 -> but we need N at position4, here it's at3. And position3 is N, not I. So no.
- We need the pattern: [1][2] I N O.

So: 
- position3: I
- position4: N
- position5: O

So the last three letters are ""INO"".

Now, what words have that? 
- CASINO: C A S I N O -> positions: 1-C, 2-A, 3-S, 4-I, 5-N, 6-O? Wait, that's 6 letters. Casino is 6 letters? No, C-A-S-I-N-O is 6 letters? C-A-S-I-N-O: C(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5), O(6) — 6 letters. So not 5.

5-letter words ending with INO:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- There is ""KINO"", but that's K-I-N-O, which is 4 letters? Or 5? K-I-N-O is 4. We need 5 letters.

Actually, let's think: 
- The word must be 5 letters: letter1, letter2, I, N, O.

So: [1][2] I N O

Now, what are some English words?
- BIINO? Not a word.
- CHINO: C-H-I-N-O -> that's 5 letters: C1, H2, I3, N4, O5 -> perfect! And C and H are not in the absent list.

CHINO is a word (a type of cloth or khaki).

Similarly, other words:
- RHINO: R-H-I-N-O -> but R is absent, so no.
- SHINO? Not common, and S is absent.
- THINO? Not a word.
- WHINO? Not a word.

Another one: 
- ALGIN? But that ends with GIN, not INO.

What about ""VINHO""? Not English.

So CHINO seems a candidate.

But we have to check if it fits: 
- Position1: C
- Position2: H
- Position3: I (correct)
- Position4: N (correct)
- Position5: O

And we know O is present and not in position2 (which it isn't, it's in position5) and we know O is in the word.

Also, C and H are new letters.

But is there another possibility? What if the word has O in position1? We had trouble, but let's try again.

If O is in position1: O [2] I N [5]

[2] must be a letter that forms a word. Examples:
- OMINA: but A is absent.
- OVINE: E is absent.
- ORCIN: O-R-C-I-N -> but R is absent.
- OLDIN? Not a word.
- OUNCE: O-U-N-C-E -> positions: O1, U2, N3, C4, E5 -> but we need position3 to be I, not N. And position4 is C, not N. So no.

So it seems difficult. Maybe O at position1 is not feasible.

Another word: DOING? D-O-I-N-G -> positions: D1, O2, I3, N4, G5 -> that fits the pattern! But in POINT, we had O in position2 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. But in DOING, O is in position2, which was the same position as in POINT? In POINT, O was in position2 and got '-', meaning it's not in position2 in the secret word. So if we put O in position2 again, it would be wrong.

But in DOING, O is at position2, which is the same as in POINT, and we know from POINT that O is not in position2. Therefore, DOING cannot be the word because it has O in position2.

Similarly, any word with O in position2 is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern O [2] I N [5], we must have [2] not O, which we know, but also O cannot be in position2, so that's fine. But we need a word that starts with O and has I at3 and N at4.

But as above, I can't find a common word. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that O is in position5, so the word is [1][2] I N O.

And we have CHINO as a candidate.

But are there others?
- KHINO? Not English.
- PHINO? No.
- FLINO? No.
- BLINO? No.
- So CHINO seems the only common one.

But CHINO: C and H are not ruled out.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in CHINO, all letters are distinct and no conflict.

Another word: ""QUINO""? Not common.

So probably CHINO is a good candidate.

But we have only one guess so far that fits, but we need to make a guess that might not be the solution but gives more information? We have 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests more letters, but we have the pattern and we know O must be in position5, so if we guess CHINO, it might be the word.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about if the word has O in position1? We must not rule it out completely.

For example, ""OCTIN""? Not a word.

""OXBOW"" doesn't fit.

""OFLIN""? Not a word.

So it seems very limited.

Another word ending with INO: ""BENZO"" but that's B-E-N-Z-O, which has E and positions: B1, E2, N3, Z4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not N. And E is absent.

So no.

Therefore, the most likely word is CHINO.

But we can also think of words that might have O in position1 but we haven't considered. For example, ""OAKEN"" but E is absent and positions don't match.

I think CHINO is the best bet.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is CHINO.

If we guess CHINO:
- C: new letter, if the word is CHINO, it would be correct at position1? But we don't know if it's correct. In the secret word, if it is CHINO, then C would be ✓, H would be ✓, I ✓, N ✓, O ✓.

But if it's not, we get feedback.

But we have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: the word might have O in position1 and a different letter in position5.

For example, ""OMIN?"" but not 5 letters.

""ORPIN"": O-R-P-I-N -> but R and P are absent.

""ODLIN""? Not a word.

I think it's safe to go with CHINO.

But we have to make a guess that might not be the word but helps eliminate.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we can guess CHINO directly.

If it's not, we get feedback that tells us about C and H.

But let's see: if we guess CHINO and it's not the word, we might get:

- If C is present or not, and H, etc.

But we know the pattern is _ _ I N O, so the word ends with INO.

What are all 5-letter English words ending with INO?

- CHINO (as above)
- There is also ""KINO"", but that's 4 letters? Or ""kino"" can be 4, but sometimes extended? No, 4.
- ""PINO"" 4 letters.
- ""VINO"" 4 letters.

In 5 letters, I think CHINO is the only common one.

But there is ""LINGO"", but L-I-N-G-O -> positions: L1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.

""BINGO"" same issue.

So I think CHINO is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, I will guess CHINO.

But to be thorough, let's consider if the word has a repeated letter? For example, if O appears twice? But in the pattern, if O is in position1 and position5, then the word would be O [2] I N O.

But [2] must be a letter that works. For example, ""ONION"": O-N-I-O-N -> positions: O1, N2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need position4 to be N, not O. And position2 is N, which is fixed? No, position4 must be N, but in ONION, position4 is O, not N. So no.

""OZONI""? Not a word.

So I think CHINO is the only reasonable guess.

Thus, we go with CHINO.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **R, A, S, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT** → Feedback: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is confirmed at position 3 (✓).  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (✓).  
  - **O** is in the word but misplaced (not at position 2) (-).  
  - **P** and **T** are absent.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 must be **I**.  
   - Position 4 must be **N**.  
   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N _`.  

2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (from POINT feedback). Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed (I and N), **O must be at position 1 or 5**.  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, S, E, P, T** are eliminated. Cannot use these.  

4. **Possible letters for remaining positions**:  
   - Position 1: Could be **O** or another unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 2: Cannot be **O** (per feedback) and must be an unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be **O** or another unused letter.  
   - Since **O** is confirmed present, the word must contain exactly one **O** (no repetition indicated yet, so we assume no doubles for now).  

5. **Word pattern constraints**:  
   - The word must fit `_ _ I N _` with **O** in position 1 or 5.  
   - Common English words fitting this pattern with **O** in position 5 (e.g., **CHINO**) are strong candidates, as **O** in position 1 yields few valid words (e.g., no common words like ""OMINA"" due to absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the most likely candidate word based on the pattern and feedback.  
- **Why CHINO?**  
  - Fits the pattern `C H I N O`:  
    - Position 3: **I** (✓)  
    - Position 4: **N** (✓)  
    - Position 5: **O** (tests if **O** is here, as required)  
  - Uses new letters **C** and **H** (not eliminated, high frequency).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, feedback on **C** and **H** will narrow options further (e.g., if **C** or **H** is absent/misplaced).  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""RHINO"" (invalid due to **R**), ""SHINO"" (invalid due to **S**), or ""BLINO"" (not a word) were rejected.  

<guess>CHINO</guess>",CHINO,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. **RAISE**: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. **POINT**: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is still correct in position 3 (we knew that).
     - 'N' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
     - 'O' is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's not in position 2).
     - P and T are not in the word.

From this, we can deduce:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ 
  - Position 3: I (fixed)
  - Position 4: N (fixed)
- Additionally, the word contains the letter 'O', but not in position 2 (and since position 4 is N, O must be in position 1, 5, or possibly 2 but we know it's not in 2 from POINT feedback, so actually position 1 or 5).
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T. So we cannot use these.

We also know the word must have an 'O' in it (from the '-' feedback for O in POINT), and it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N).

So the pattern is: [position1] [position2] I N [position5]

And we know:
- Position1: can be O or another letter (but if it's not O, then O must be in position5)
- Position2: cannot be O (from POINT feedback), and must be a letter not in the absent list.
- Position5: similarly, must be a letter not absent, and if O is not in position1, it must be here.

Also, the word must contain at least one 'O' (since it's present but misplaced).

Now, we need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ 

With the constraints:
- Contains O (in position 1 or 5)
- Does not contain: R, A, S, E, P, T

We can list possible letters for the remaining positions. The alphabet without the absent letters: 
B, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used in position 3, and we don't know if it can repeat? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't seen any repetition yet. However, we must consider the possibility. But note: in POINT, we had I and N, and they were both present, but in the secret word, we have I and N fixed. The feedback for O was '-' meaning it's present but not in position 2, but it doesn't tell us if there are multiple O's. However, for now, let's assume no repetition until we have evidence.

But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know. But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

However, since we have limited guesses, we might try to avoid repetition for now.

So, for position1: possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, O, and also U, V, W, Y, Z, but less common. But we have O as a strong candidate because we know O is in the word.

Similarly, position2: cannot be O, and must be from the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, U, V, W, Y, Z (and not the absent ones).

Position5: same as position1, but note that if position1 is O, then position5 cannot be O (if we assume no repetition, but we don't know). But the feedback doesn't indicate multiple O's, so we can try without repetition first.

Now, let's think of words that end with IN? Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the last two are fixed as I and N? No: positions 3 and 4 are I and N, so the word ends with the fourth letter as N, and then the fifth letter is unknown. So the word is of the form: [1][2] I N [5]

Common words: 
- If the fifth letter is G, then it could be ""something"" ING, like BRING, but B is allowed, but we have R absent? R is absent, so BRING is out. Similarly, THING: T is absent. FLING: F is allowed, L is allowed, but we have to check.

But let's list possible words:

We know the word must have an O. So the O must be in position 1 or 5.

Case 1: O in position 1.
Then the word is: O [2] I N [5]
Position2: cannot be O (we know), and must be a consonant or vowel? But we have few vowels left: U or Y? Because A, E, I (I is at position3) are out. So position2 must be a consonant.

Possible words: 
- OMIN? But that's 4 letters, we need 5: O _ I N _ 
  Examples: 
  - OMEN? But E is absent.
  - OVINE: O V I N E -> but E is absent, so no.
  - OMINA? But that's 5 letters: O M I N A -> but A is absent.
  - OUNCE? O U N C E -> but positions: O at1, U at2, N at3? But we need position3 to be I, not N. So no.

We need position3 to be I and position4 to be N. So the word must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So for O at position1: O [2] I N [5]

What can [2] be? It must be a letter that forms a word with O and then IN. Examples:
- JOIN? But J O I N -> that's 4 letters. We need 5: so it must be JOIN followed by something? No, 5-letter word.

5-letter words starting with O and having I at position3 and N at position4:
- OBANG? Not a common word.
- OCHIN? Not common.
- OMINA? O-M-I-N-A, but A is absent.
- OVINE: O-V-I-N-E, but E is absent.

I'm struggling. Maybe O at position1 is not common.

Case 2: O in position5.
Then the word is: [1] [2] I N O

So it ends with INO? Like words ending in INO: but that's usually for names or specific words.

Examples:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: 
  - CASINO? But C-A-S-I-N-O -> positions: C1, A2, S3? But we need I at position3 and N at4. Here, S is at3? No, and S is absent.
  - We need [1][2] I N O, so the last three are I, N, O.

Words: 
- BINGO? B-I-N-G-O -> positions: B1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.
- We need: position1: ?, position2: ?, position3: I, position4: N, position5: O.

So the word ends with ""INO"".

Examples of 5-letter words ending with INO:
- CONDO: C-O-N-D-O -> positions: C1, O2, N3, D4, O5 -> but we need N at position4, here it's at3. And position3 is N, not I. So no.
- We need the pattern: [1][2] I N O.

So: 
- position3: I
- position4: N
- position5: O

So the last three letters are ""INO"".

Now, what words have that? 
- CASINO: C A S I N O -> positions: 1-C, 2-A, 3-S, 4-I, 5-N, 6-O? Wait, that's 6 letters. Casino is 6 letters? No, C-A-S-I-N-O is 6 letters? C-A-S-I-N-O: C(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5), O(6) — 6 letters. So not 5.

5-letter words ending with INO:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- There is ""KINO"", but that's K-I-N-O, which is 4 letters? Or 5? K-I-N-O is 4. We need 5 letters.

Actually, let's think: 
- The word must be 5 letters: letter1, letter2, I, N, O.

So: [1][2] I N O

Now, what are some English words?
- BIINO? Not a word.
- CHINO: C-H-I-N-O -> that's 5 letters: C1, H2, I3, N4, O5 -> perfect! And C and H are not in the absent list.

CHINO is a word (a type of cloth or khaki).

Similarly, other words:
- RHINO: R-H-I-N-O -> but R is absent, so no.
- SHINO? Not common, and S is absent.
- THINO? Not a word.
- WHINO? Not a word.

Another one: 
- ALGIN? But that ends with GIN, not INO.

What about ""VINHO""? Not English.

So CHINO seems a candidate.

But we have to check if it fits: 
- Position1: C
- Position2: H
- Position3: I (correct)
- Position4: N (correct)
- Position5: O

And we know O is present and not in position2 (which it isn't, it's in position5) and we know O is in the word.

Also, C and H are new letters.

But is there another possibility? What if the word has O in position1? We had trouble, but let's try again.

If O is in position1: O [2] I N [5]

[2] must be a letter that forms a word. Examples:
- OMINA: but A is absent.
- OVINE: E is absent.
- ORCIN: O-R-C-I-N -> but R is absent.
- OLDIN? Not a word.
- OUNCE: O-U-N-C-E -> positions: O1, U2, N3, C4, E5 -> but we need position3 to be I, not N. And position4 is C, not N. So no.

So it seems difficult. Maybe O at position1 is not feasible.

Another word: DOING? D-O-I-N-G -> positions: D1, O2, I3, N4, G5 -> that fits the pattern! But in POINT, we had O in position2 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. But in DOING, O is in position2, which was the same position as in POINT? In POINT, O was in position2 and got '-', meaning it's not in position2 in the secret word. So if we put O in position2 again, it would be wrong.

But in DOING, O is at position2, which is the same as in POINT, and we know from POINT that O is not in position2. Therefore, DOING cannot be the word because it has O in position2.

Similarly, any word with O in position2 is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern O [2] I N [5], we must have [2] not O, which we know, but also O cannot be in position2, so that's fine. But we need a word that starts with O and has I at3 and N at4.

But as above, I can't find a common word. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that O is in position5, so the word is [1][2] I N O.

And we have CHINO as a candidate.

But are there others?
- KHINO? Not English.
- PHINO? No.
- FLINO? No.
- BLINO? No.
- So CHINO seems the only common one.

But CHINO: C and H are not ruled out.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in CHINO, all letters are distinct and no conflict.

Another word: ""QUINO""? Not common.

So probably CHINO is a good candidate.

But we have only one guess so far that fits, but we need to make a guess that might not be the solution but gives more information? We have 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests more letters, but we have the pattern and we know O must be in position5, so if we guess CHINO, it might be the word.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about if the word has O in position1? We must not rule it out completely.

For example, ""OCTIN""? Not a word.

""OXBOW"" doesn't fit.

""OFLIN""? Not a word.

So it seems very limited.

Another word ending with INO: ""BENZO"" but that's B-E-N-Z-O, which has E and positions: B1, E2, N3, Z4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not N. And E is absent.

So no.

Therefore, the most likely word is CHINO.

But we can also think of words that might have O in position1 but we haven't considered. For example, ""OAKEN"" but E is absent and positions don't match.

I think CHINO is the best bet.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is CHINO.

If we guess CHINO:
- C: new letter, if the word is CHINO, it would be correct at position1? But we don't know if it's correct. In the secret word, if it is CHINO, then C would be ✓, H would be ✓, I ✓, N ✓, O ✓.

But if it's not, we get feedback.

But we have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: the word might have O in position1 and a different letter in position5.

For example, ""OMIN?"" but not 5 letters.

""ORPIN"": O-R-P-I-N -> but R and P are absent.

""ODLIN""? Not a word.

I think it's safe to go with CHINO.

But we have to make a guess that might not be the word but helps eliminate.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we can guess CHINO directly.

If it's not, we get feedback that tells us about C and H.

But let's see: if we guess CHINO and it's not the word, we might get:

- If C is present or not, and H, etc.

But we know the pattern is _ _ I N O, so the word ends with INO.

What are all 5-letter English words ending with INO?

- CHINO (as above)
- There is also ""KINO"", but that's 4 letters? Or ""kino"" can be 4, but sometimes extended? No, 4.
- ""PINO"" 4 letters.
- ""VINO"" 4 letters.

In 5 letters, I think CHINO is the only common one.

But there is ""LINGO"", but L-I-N-G-O -> positions: L1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.

""BINGO"" same issue.

So I think CHINO is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, I will guess CHINO.

But to be thorough, let's consider if the word has a repeated letter? For example, if O appears twice? But in the pattern, if O is in position1 and position5, then the word would be O [2] I N O.

But [2] must be a letter that works. For example, ""ONION"": O-N-I-O-N -> positions: O1, N2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need position4 to be N, not O. And position2 is N, which is fixed? No, position4 must be N, but in ONION, position4 is O, not N. So no.

""OZONI""? Not a word.

So I think CHINO is the only reasonable guess.

Thus, we go with CHINO.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **R, A, S, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT** → Feedback: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is confirmed at position 3 (✓).  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (✓).  
  - **O** is in the word but misplaced (not at position 2) (-).  
  - **P** and **T** are absent.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 must be **I**.  
   - Position 4 must be **N**.  
   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N _`.  

2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (from POINT feedback). Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed (I and N), **O must be at position 1 or 5**.  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, S, E, P, T** are eliminated. Cannot use these.  

4. **Possible letters for remaining positions**:  
   - Position 1: Could be **O** or another unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 2: Cannot be **O** (per feedback) and must be an unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be **O** or another unused letter.  
   - Since **O** is confirmed present, the word must contain exactly one **O** (no repetition indicated yet, so we assume no doubles for now).  

5. **Word pattern constraints**:  
   - The word must fit `_ _ I N _` with **O** in position 1 or 5.  
   - Common English words fitting this pattern with **O** in position 5 (e.g., **CHINO**) are strong candidates, as **O** in position 1 yields few valid words (e.g., no common words like ""OMINA"" due to absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the most likely candidate word based on the pattern and feedback.  
- **Why CHINO?**  
  - Fits the pattern `C H I N O`:  
    - Position 3: **I** (✓)  
    - Position 4: **N** (✓)  
    - Position 5: **O** (tests if **O** is here, as required)  
  - Uses new letters **C** and **H** (not eliminated, high frequency).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, feedback on **C** and **H** will narrow options further (e.g., if **C** or **H** is absent/misplaced).  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""RHINO"" (invalid due to **R**), ""SHINO"" (invalid due to **S**), or ""BLINO"" (not a word) were rejected.",Guess 3: CHINO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) O(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are about to make our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get. This typically means choosing a word that has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

A commonly used starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). But note we might choose alternatives that avoid repeating letters and cover more common letters.

Another popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives a good mix.

However, let me check the rules: we are not restricted to any specific dictionary, so we can choose any valid English word.

Idea: We want to cover letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

According to English letter frequency, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

So let's try to pick a word that includes as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Example: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative net earnings of a company) is sometimes used, but it might be obscure.

""RAISE"" is a common starting word: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 common letters.

""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E -> also good.

But ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E -> also common.

Given that we don't want to leave out S and L which are in the top 10, perhaps ""SLATE"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E -> less coverage of the top letters? Actually, E, A, R are in the top 5, and N is common too.

But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence of letters and whether they are in the correct position.

Since it's the first guess, any of these would work. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, I, E (three vowels) and two consonants R and S, which are very common.

But let's confirm: R, A, I, S, E -> all different.

We are allowed 6 tries, so even if we don't hit any, we will have eliminated several letters.

Alternatively, some people like to use ""WEARY"" but W and Y are less common.

I think ""RAISE"" is a solid first guess.

Therefore, I will go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. This involves selecting a word with common letters and a diverse letter set to cover more possibilities. 

Analysis:
- Common letters in 5-letter words (based on frequency): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.
- A strong first guess should include several of these letters without repeating any to increase the chance of revealing useful feedback.
- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""RAISE"" are often recommended as starting words because they cover a good spread of vowels and consonants.
- I chose ""RAISE"" as it uses five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. This combination covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). It hits six of the top ten frequent letters and provides broad coverage to help narrow down the secret word based on feedback.

This guess will yield feedback that indicates:
- Which letters are present and in the correct position (✓)
- Which letters are present but incorrect position (-)
- Which letters are absent (x)

This information will guide subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R(x) - R is not in the word.
A(x) - A is not in the word.
I(✓) - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since R=position1, A=2, I=3, S=4, E=5).
S(x) - S is not in the word.
E(x) - E is not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The letter I is present and it's in the third position. So the secret word has the form: _ _ I _ _ 
- R, A, S, E are absent. So they are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word containing an 'I' in the third position, and without using R, A, S, E.

Given the constraints:
- Position 3 must be 'I'.
- We must avoid R, A, S, E.

We want to try to cover other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters still available: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

Since many vowels are ruled out (A, E are out, and we have I only), we might consider other vowels or consonants.

We know the word has an I in the third position, so to maximize information, we can try a word that uses common consonants in the other positions.

For example, we could try words ending with I, such as _ _ I _ _

Possible letters for position 1: We can use T, O, C, N, P, L, M, etc.

We also want to avoid repeating letters we know are absent (R, A, S, E) and we don't know about others yet.

Let me think of some words that fit: 
- Ending with I: but note, position 3 is I, so the word has I in the middle.
Common patterns: 

Let's list words that have 'I' as the third letter.

Some examples:
- SKIMP: but S is absent, so skip any with S.
- BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> no A, R, S, E? B, L, M, P are allowed.
- CHINK: C, H, I, N, K
- THING: T, H, I, N, G
- CLING: C, L, I, N, G
- FLING: F, L, I, N, G
- TIGHT: T, I, G, H, T - wait, this has two T's? Also, I is at position 2? No, we need I at position 3.

Position 3 must be I, so the word pattern is: _ _ I _ _

THING: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> valid? THING is a word.
Similarly, CHINK: 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-K -> valid? CHINK might be sensitive, better avoid.
FLINT: but N is at position 4? FLINT: F-L-I-N-T, so positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T -> that works, and no R,A,S,E.

But FLINT: does it avoid the absent letters? F, L, I, N, T. I is already known. R,A,S,E absent, so F,L,N,T are new.

Similarly, words like POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T.

But O is a vowel, and we might cover common letters.

Another one: MOIST? But S is absent, so cannot use.

We must avoid S.

Another: JOINT? J is less common.

Alternatively, we can try words that might test other vowels: like OU or U, but U is less common.

Since I is fixed at position 3, and the word has five positions, we can focus on common letters for the other positions.

Let me pick a word that covers many of the remaining common consonants and vowels.

For example, include O, T, N, L.

Possible word: POINT: P-O-I-N-T. This uses P, O, N, T (with I in the middle).

However, P is moderately common, O is vowel, N and T are common.

Other options: FLINT, as above.

JOINT is J-O-I-N-T, J not so common.

BLIND: B-L-I-N-D -> position 3 I, and avoids R,A,S,E? B,L,N,D. Good.

BLIND: letters B, L, I, N, D.

Or CLING: C-L-I-N-G.

Now, which one to choose? We might want to use a word that has letters that are frequently used to get more feedback.

Also, note that in FLINT or POINT, we have a T at the end, which is common.

Similarly, THING has T at the start and G at the end.

I think POINT is a good candidate: it uses P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5 respectively.

It has no repeated letters, and O, T, N are very common.

Alternatively, if we think the word might have a U or another vowel, but we don't have much to go on.

But we already have I, and A and E are eliminated, so the vowel pool is narrowed. Possible vowels left: O, U, and sometimes Y.

But Y is less likely without E.

So let's go with POINT.

Thus, second guess: POINT.

But note: In the feedback for RAISE, I was correct in position 3, so in POINT, I is at position 3 again, which should be correct, so we'll expect I(✓) again.

Other letters: P, O, N, T are new, and we'll see if they are present and in the right positions.

This should give us new information.

We can also consider: if there was another common letter pattern.

Another word: BUILD? But U is at position 2 and position 3 is I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> position 3 I? U is position 2, I position 3? BUILD: 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D -> that works.

But U might be less common. POINT seems more balanced.

I'll go with POINT.

But let me check if POINT is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: POINTBased on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"":  
- R, A, S, E are absent (x) → **Cannot use R, A, S, or E again.**  
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) → **The secret word has 'I' as the third letter (pattern: _ _ I _ _).**  

To maximize information for the second guess:  
- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, S, E).  
- Test other common letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, P).  
- Focus on words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _, using distinct new letters to cover more possibilities.  

I choose **""POINT""** because:  
- Includes common letters (O, T, N, P).  
- Fits the known pattern: P in position 1, O in 2, I (correct) in 3, N in 4, T in 5.  
- Avoids eliminated letters (no R, A, S, E).  

This guess tests whether O, T, N, or P exist in the word and their positions, helping narrow down options significantly.

<guess>POINT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. **RAISE**: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
     - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. **POINT**: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - This means:
     - 'I' is still correct in position 3 (we knew that).
     - 'N' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
     - 'O' is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's not in position 2).
     - P and T are not in the word.

From this, we can deduce:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ 
  - Position 3: I (fixed)
  - Position 4: N (fixed)
- Additionally, the word contains the letter 'O', but not in position 2 (and since position 4 is N, O must be in position 1, 5, or possibly 2 but we know it's not in 2 from POINT feedback, so actually position 1 or 5).
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T. So we cannot use these.

We also know the word must have an 'O' in it (from the '-' feedback for O in POINT), and it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N).

So the pattern is: [position1] [position2] I N [position5]

And we know:
- Position1: can be O or another letter (but if it's not O, then O must be in position5)
- Position2: cannot be O (from POINT feedback), and must be a letter not in the absent list.
- Position5: similarly, must be a letter not absent, and if O is not in position1, it must be here.

Also, the word must contain at least one 'O' (since it's present but misplaced).

Now, we need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ 

With the constraints:
- Contains O (in position 1 or 5)
- Does not contain: R, A, S, E, P, T

We can list possible letters for the remaining positions. The alphabet without the absent letters: 
B, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used in position 3, and we don't know if it can repeat? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven't seen any repetition yet. However, we must consider the possibility. But note: in POINT, we had I and N, and they were both present, but in the secret word, we have I and N fixed. The feedback for O was '-' meaning it's present but not in position 2, but it doesn't tell us if there are multiple O's. However, for now, let's assume no repetition until we have evidence.

But the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know. But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

However, since we have limited guesses, we might try to avoid repetition for now.

So, for position1: possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, O, and also U, V, W, Y, Z, but less common. But we have O as a strong candidate because we know O is in the word.

Similarly, position2: cannot be O, and must be from the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, U, V, W, Y, Z (and not the absent ones).

Position5: same as position1, but note that if position1 is O, then position5 cannot be O (if we assume no repetition, but we don't know). But the feedback doesn't indicate multiple O's, so we can try without repetition first.

Now, let's think of words that end with IN? Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the last two are fixed as I and N? No: positions 3 and 4 are I and N, so the word ends with the fourth letter as N, and then the fifth letter is unknown. So the word is of the form: [1][2] I N [5]

Common words: 
- If the fifth letter is G, then it could be ""something"" ING, like BRING, but B is allowed, but we have R absent? R is absent, so BRING is out. Similarly, THING: T is absent. FLING: F is allowed, L is allowed, but we have to check.

But let's list possible words:

We know the word must have an O. So the O must be in position 1 or 5.

Case 1: O in position 1.
Then the word is: O [2] I N [5]
Position2: cannot be O (we know), and must be a consonant or vowel? But we have few vowels left: U or Y? Because A, E, I (I is at position3) are out. So position2 must be a consonant.

Possible words: 
- OMIN? But that's 4 letters, we need 5: O _ I N _ 
  Examples: 
  - OMEN? But E is absent.
  - OVINE: O V I N E -> but E is absent, so no.
  - OMINA? But that's 5 letters: O M I N A -> but A is absent.
  - OUNCE? O U N C E -> but positions: O at1, U at2, N at3? But we need position3 to be I, not N. So no.

We need position3 to be I and position4 to be N. So the word must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So for O at position1: O [2] I N [5]

What can [2] be? It must be a letter that forms a word with O and then IN. Examples:
- JOIN? But J O I N -> that's 4 letters. We need 5: so it must be JOIN followed by something? No, 5-letter word.

5-letter words starting with O and having I at position3 and N at position4:
- OBANG? Not a common word.
- OCHIN? Not common.
- OMINA? O-M-I-N-A, but A is absent.
- OVINE: O-V-I-N-E, but E is absent.

I'm struggling. Maybe O at position1 is not common.

Case 2: O in position5.
Then the word is: [1] [2] I N O

So it ends with INO? Like words ending in INO: but that's usually for names or specific words.

Examples:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: 
  - CASINO? But C-A-S-I-N-O -> positions: C1, A2, S3? But we need I at position3 and N at4. Here, S is at3? No, and S is absent.
  - We need [1][2] I N O, so the last three are I, N, O.

Words: 
- BINGO? B-I-N-G-O -> positions: B1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.
- We need: position1: ?, position2: ?, position3: I, position4: N, position5: O.

So the word ends with ""INO"".

Examples of 5-letter words ending with INO:
- CONDO: C-O-N-D-O -> positions: C1, O2, N3, D4, O5 -> but we need N at position4, here it's at3. And position3 is N, not I. So no.
- We need the pattern: [1][2] I N O.

So: 
- position3: I
- position4: N
- position5: O

So the last three letters are ""INO"".

Now, what words have that? 
- CASINO: C A S I N O -> positions: 1-C, 2-A, 3-S, 4-I, 5-N, 6-O? Wait, that's 6 letters. Casino is 6 letters? No, C-A-S-I-N-O is 6 letters? C-A-S-I-N-O: C(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5), O(6) — 6 letters. So not 5.

5-letter words ending with INO:
- MINO? 4 letters.
- There is ""KINO"", but that's K-I-N-O, which is 4 letters? Or 5? K-I-N-O is 4. We need 5 letters.

Actually, let's think: 
- The word must be 5 letters: letter1, letter2, I, N, O.

So: [1][2] I N O

Now, what are some English words?
- BIINO? Not a word.
- CHINO: C-H-I-N-O -> that's 5 letters: C1, H2, I3, N4, O5 -> perfect! And C and H are not in the absent list.

CHINO is a word (a type of cloth or khaki).

Similarly, other words:
- RHINO: R-H-I-N-O -> but R is absent, so no.
- SHINO? Not common, and S is absent.
- THINO? Not a word.
- WHINO? Not a word.

Another one: 
- ALGIN? But that ends with GIN, not INO.

What about ""VINHO""? Not English.

So CHINO seems a candidate.

But we have to check if it fits: 
- Position1: C
- Position2: H
- Position3: I (correct)
- Position4: N (correct)
- Position5: O

And we know O is present and not in position2 (which it isn't, it's in position5) and we know O is in the word.

Also, C and H are new letters.

But is there another possibility? What if the word has O in position1? We had trouble, but let's try again.

If O is in position1: O [2] I N [5]

[2] must be a letter that forms a word. Examples:
- OMINA: but A is absent.
- OVINE: E is absent.
- ORCIN: O-R-C-I-N -> but R is absent.
- OLDIN? Not a word.
- OUNCE: O-U-N-C-E -> positions: O1, U2, N3, C4, E5 -> but we need position3 to be I, not N. And position4 is C, not N. So no.

So it seems difficult. Maybe O at position1 is not feasible.

Another word: DOING? D-O-I-N-G -> positions: D1, O2, I3, N4, G5 -> that fits the pattern! But in POINT, we had O in position2 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. But in DOING, O is in position2, which was the same position as in POINT? In POINT, O was in position2 and got '-', meaning it's not in position2 in the secret word. So if we put O in position2 again, it would be wrong.

But in DOING, O is at position2, which is the same as in POINT, and we know from POINT that O is not in position2. Therefore, DOING cannot be the word because it has O in position2.

Similarly, any word with O in position2 is invalid.

Therefore, for the pattern O [2] I N [5], we must have [2] not O, which we know, but also O cannot be in position2, so that's fine. But we need a word that starts with O and has I at3 and N at4.

But as above, I can't find a common word. 

Therefore, the only possibility is that O is in position5, so the word is [1][2] I N O.

And we have CHINO as a candidate.

But are there others?
- KHINO? Not English.
- PHINO? No.
- FLINO? No.
- BLINO? No.
- So CHINO seems the only common one.

But CHINO: C and H are not ruled out.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in CHINO, all letters are distinct and no conflict.

Another word: ""QUINO""? Not common.

So probably CHINO is a good candidate.

But we have only one guess so far that fits, but we need to make a guess that might not be the solution but gives more information? We have 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we could make a guess that tests more letters, but we have the pattern and we know O must be in position5, so if we guess CHINO, it might be the word.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about if the word has O in position1? We must not rule it out completely.

For example, ""OCTIN""? Not a word.

""OXBOW"" doesn't fit.

""OFLIN""? Not a word.

So it seems very limited.

Another word ending with INO: ""BENZO"" but that's B-E-N-Z-O, which has E and positions: B1, E2, N3, Z4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not N. And E is absent.

So no.

Therefore, the most likely word is CHINO.

But we can also think of words that might have O in position1 but we haven't considered. For example, ""OAKEN"" but E is absent and positions don't match.

I think CHINO is the best bet.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is CHINO.

If we guess CHINO:
- C: new letter, if the word is CHINO, it would be correct at position1? But we don't know if it's correct. In the secret word, if it is CHINO, then C would be ✓, H would be ✓, I ✓, N ✓, O ✓.

But if it's not, we get feedback.

But we have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: the word might have O in position1 and a different letter in position5.

For example, ""OMIN?"" but not 5 letters.

""ORPIN"": O-R-P-I-N -> but R and P are absent.

""ODLIN""? Not a word.

I think it's safe to go with CHINO.

But we have to make a guess that might not be the word but helps eliminate.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we can guess CHINO directly.

If it's not, we get feedback that tells us about C and H.

But let's see: if we guess CHINO and it's not the word, we might get:

- If C is present or not, and H, etc.

But we know the pattern is _ _ I N O, so the word ends with INO.

What are all 5-letter English words ending with INO?

- CHINO (as above)
- There is also ""KINO"", but that's 4 letters? Or ""kino"" can be 4, but sometimes extended? No, 4.
- ""PINO"" 4 letters.
- ""VINO"" 4 letters.

In 5 letters, I think CHINO is the only common one.

But there is ""LINGO"", but L-I-N-G-O -> positions: L1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.

""BINGO"" same issue.

So I think CHINO is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, I will guess CHINO.

But to be thorough, let's consider if the word has a repeated letter? For example, if O appears twice? But in the pattern, if O is in position1 and position5, then the word would be O [2] I N O.

But [2] must be a letter that works. For example, ""ONION"": O-N-I-O-N -> positions: O1, N2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need position4 to be N, not O. And position2 is N, which is fixed? No, position4 must be N, but in ONION, position4 is O, not N. So no.

""OZONI""? Not a word.

So I think CHINO is the only reasonable guess.

Thus, we go with CHINO.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **R, A, S, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT** → Feedback: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is confirmed at position 3 (✓).  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (✓).  
  - **O** is in the word but misplaced (not at position 2) (-).  
  - **P** and **T** are absent.  

### Deductions
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3 must be **I**.  
   - Position 4 must be **N**.  
   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N _`.  

2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (from POINT feedback). Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed (I and N), **O must be at position 1 or 5**.  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, S, E, P, T** are eliminated. Cannot use these.  

4. **Possible letters for remaining positions**:  
   - Position 1: Could be **O** or another unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 2: Cannot be **O** (per feedback) and must be an unused letter (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y).  
   - Position 5: Could be **O** or another unused letter.  
   - Since **O** is confirmed present, the word must contain exactly one **O** (no repetition indicated yet, so we assume no doubles for now).  

5. **Word pattern constraints**:  
   - The word must fit `_ _ I N _` with **O** in position 1 or 5.  
   - Common English words fitting this pattern with **O** in position 5 (e.g., **CHINO**) are strong candidates, as **O** in position 1 yields few valid words (e.g., no common words like ""OMINA"" due to absent letters).  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the most likely candidate word based on the pattern and feedback.  
- **Why CHINO?**  
  - Fits the pattern `C H I N O`:  
    - Position 3: **I** (✓)  
    - Position 4: **N** (✓)  
    - Position 5: **O** (tests if **O** is here, as required)  
  - Uses new letters **C** and **H** (not eliminated, high frequency).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, feedback on **C** and **H** will narrow options further (e.g., if **C** or **H** is absent/misplaced).  
- **Alternatives considered**: Words like ""RHINO"" (invalid due to **R**), ""SHINO"" (invalid due to **S**), or ""BLINO"" (not a word) were rejected.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get. This typically means choosing a word that has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nA commonly used starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). But note we might choose alternatives that avoid repeating letters and cover more common letters.\n\nAnother popular starting word is ""SLATE"", which gives a good mix.\n\nHowever, let me check the rules: we are not restricted to any specific dictionary, so we can choose any valid English word.\n\nIdea: We want to cover letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.\n\nAccording to English letter frequency, the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.\n\nSo let\'s try to pick a word that includes as many of these as possible without repeating letters.\n\nExample: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative net earnings of a company) is sometimes used, but it might be obscure.\n\n""RAISE"" is a common starting word: R, A, I, S, E -> covers 5 common letters.\n\n""ORATE"": O, R, A, T, E -> also good.\n\nBut ""SLATE"" includes S, L, A, T, E -> also common.\n\nGiven that we don\'t want to leave out S and L which are in the top 10, perhaps ""SLATE"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E -> less coverage of the top letters? Actually, E, A, R are in the top 5, and N is common too.\n\nBut note: the feedback will tell us about the presence of letters and whether they are in the correct position.\n\nSince it\'s the first guess, any of these would work. Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it contains A, I, E (three vowels) and two consonants R and S, which are very common.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: R, A, I, S, E -> all different.\n\nWe are allowed 6 tries, so even if we don\'t hit any, we will have eliminated several letters.\n\nAlternatively, some people like to use ""WEARY"" but W and Y are less common.\n\nI think ""RAISE"" is a solid first guess.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need to choose a 5-letter English word that maximizes the information gained about the secret word. This involves selecting a word with common letters and a diverse letter set to cover more possibilities. \n\nAnalysis:\n- Common letters in 5-letter words (based on frequency): E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.\n- A strong first guess should include several of these letters without repeating any to increase the chance of revealing useful feedback.\n- Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", and ""RAISE"" are often recommended as starting words because they cover a good spread of vowels and consonants.\n- I chose ""RAISE"" as it uses five distinct letters: R, A, I, S, E. This combination covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). It hits six of the top ten frequent letters and provides broad coverage to help narrow down the secret word based on feedback.\n\nThis guess will yield feedback that indicates:\n- Which letters are present and in the correct position (✓)\n- Which letters are present but incorrect position (-)\n- Which letters are absent (x)\n\nThis information will guide subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": \nR(x) - R is not in the word.\nA(x) - A is not in the word.\nI(✓) - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since R=position1, A=2, I=3, S=4, E=5).\nS(x) - S is not in the word.\nE(x) - E is not in the word.\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The letter I is present and it\'s in the third position. So the secret word has the form: _ _ I _ _ \n- R, A, S, E are absent. So they are not in the word at all.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word containing an \'I\' in the third position, and without using R, A, S, E.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- Position 3 must be \'I\'.\n- We must avoid R, A, S, E.\n\nWe want to try to cover other common letters to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters still available: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.\n\nSince many vowels are ruled out (A, E are out, and we have I only), we might consider other vowels or consonants.\n\nWe know the word has an I in the third position, so to maximize information, we can try a word that uses common consonants in the other positions.\n\nFor example, we could try words ending with I, such as _ _ I _ _\n\nPossible letters for position 1: We can use T, O, C, N, P, L, M, etc.\n\nWe also want to avoid repeating letters we know are absent (R, A, S, E) and we don\'t know about others yet.\n\nLet me think of some words that fit: \n- Ending with I: but note, position 3 is I, so the word has I in the middle.\nCommon patterns: \n\nLet\'s list words that have \'I\' as the third letter.\n\nSome examples:\n- SKIMP: but S is absent, so skip any with S.\n- BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> no A, R, S, E? B, L, M, P are allowed.\n- CHINK: C, H, I, N, K\n- THING: T, H, I, N, G\n- CLING: C, L, I, N, G\n- FLING: F, L, I, N, G\n- TIGHT: T, I, G, H, T - wait, this has two T\'s? Also, I is at position 2? No, we need I at position 3.\n\nPosition 3 must be I, so the word pattern is: _ _ I _ _\n\nTHING: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G -> valid? THING is a word.\nSimilarly, CHINK: 1-C, 2-H, 3-I, 4-N, 5-K -> valid? CHINK might be sensitive, better avoid.\nFLINT: but N is at position 4? FLINT: F-L-I-N-T, so positions: 1-F, 2-L, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T -> that works, and no R,A,S,E.\n\nBut FLINT: does it avoid the absent letters? F, L, I, N, T. I is already known. R,A,S,E absent, so F,L,N,T are new.\n\nSimilarly, words like POINT: P-O-I-N-T -> positions: 1-P, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-T.\n\nBut O is a vowel, and we might cover common letters.\n\nAnother one: MOIST? But S is absent, so cannot use.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nAnother: JOINT? J is less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try words that might test other vowels: like OU or U, but U is less common.\n\nSince I is fixed at position 3, and the word has five positions, we can focus on common letters for the other positions.\n\nLet me pick a word that covers many of the remaining common consonants and vowels.\n\nFor example, include O, T, N, L.\n\nPossible word: POINT: P-O-I-N-T. This uses P, O, N, T (with I in the middle).\n\nHowever, P is moderately common, O is vowel, N and T are common.\n\nOther options: FLINT, as above.\n\nJOINT is J-O-I-N-T, J not so common.\n\nBLIND: B-L-I-N-D -> position 3 I, and avoids R,A,S,E? B,L,N,D. Good.\n\nBLIND: letters B, L, I, N, D.\n\nOr CLING: C-L-I-N-G.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We might want to use a word that has letters that are frequently used to get more feedback.\n\nAlso, note that in FLINT or POINT, we have a T at the end, which is common.\n\nSimilarly, THING has T at the start and G at the end.\n\nI think POINT is a good candidate: it uses P, O, N, T in positions 1,2,4,5 respectively.\n\nIt has no repeated letters, and O, T, N are very common.\n\nAlternatively, if we think the word might have a U or another vowel, but we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nBut we already have I, and A and E are eliminated, so the vowel pool is narrowed. Possible vowels left: O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nBut Y is less likely without E.\n\nSo let\'s go with POINT.\n\nThus, second guess: POINT.\n\nBut note: In the feedback for RAISE, I was correct in position 3, so in POINT, I is at position 3 again, which should be correct, so we\'ll expect I(✓) again.\n\nOther letters: P, O, N, T are new, and we\'ll see if they are present and in the right positions.\n\nThis should give us new information.\n\nWe can also consider: if there was another common letter pattern.\n\nAnother word: BUILD? But U is at position 2 and position 3 is I? BUILD: B-U-I-L-D -> position 3 I? U is position 2, I position 3? BUILD: 1-B, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-D -> that works.\n\nBut U might be less common. POINT seems more balanced.\n\nI\'ll go with POINT.\n\nBut let me check if POINT is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo guess: POINTBased on the previous feedback for ""RAISE"":  \n- R, A, S, E are absent (x) → **Cannot use R, A, S, or E again.**  \n- I is correct and in position 3 (✓) → **The secret word has \'I\' as the third letter (pattern: _ _ I _ _).**  \n\nTo maximize information for the second guess:  \n- Avoid eliminated letters (R, A, S, E).  \n- Test other common letters (e.g., T, O, N, L, P).  \n- Focus on words fitting the pattern _ _ I _ _, using distinct new letters to cover more possibilities.  \n\nI choose **""POINT""** because:  \n- Includes common letters (O, T, N, P).  \n- Fits the known pattern: P in position 1, O in 2, I (correct) in 3, N in 4, T in 5.  \n- Avoids eliminated letters (no R, A, S, E).  \n\nThis guess tests whether O, T, N, or P exist in the word and their positions, helping narrow down options significantly.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. **RAISE**: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)\n   - This means:\n     - \'I\' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n     - R, A, S, E are not in the word at all.\n\n2. **POINT**: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)\n   - This means:\n     - \'I\' is still correct in position 3 (we knew that).\n     - \'N\' is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n     - \'O\' is in the word but in the wrong position (so it\'s not in position 2).\n     - P and T are not in the word.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I N _ \n  - Position 3: I (fixed)\n  - Position 4: N (fixed)\n- Additionally, the word contains the letter \'O\', but not in position 2 (and since position 4 is N, O must be in position 1, 5, or possibly 2 but we know it\'s not in 2 from POINT feedback, so actually position 1 or 5).\n- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T. So we cannot use these.\n\nWe also know the word must have an \'O\' in it (from the \'-\' feedback for O in POINT), and it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is ruled out and positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N).\n\nSo the pattern is: [position1] [position2] I N [position5]\n\nAnd we know:\n- Position1: can be O or another letter (but if it\'s not O, then O must be in position5)\n- Position2: cannot be O (from POINT feedback), and must be a letter not in the absent list.\n- Position5: similarly, must be a letter not absent, and if O is not in position1, it must be here.\n\nAlso, the word must contain at least one \'O\' (since it\'s present but misplaced).\n\nNow, we need to think of words that fit: _ _ I N _ \n\nWith the constraints:\n- Contains O (in position 1 or 5)\n- Does not contain: R, A, S, E, P, T\n\nWe can list possible letters for the remaining positions. The alphabet without the absent letters: \nB, C, D, F, G, H, I (but I is already used in position 3, and we don\'t know if it can repeat? Typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, we haven\'t seen any repetition yet. However, we must consider the possibility. But note: in POINT, we had I and N, and they were both present, but in the secret word, we have I and N fixed. The feedback for O was \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in position 2, but it doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple O\'s. However, for now, let\'s assume no repetition until we have evidence.\n\nBut the secret word might have repeated letters? We don\'t know. But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.\n\nHowever, since we have limited guesses, we might try to avoid repetition for now.\n\nSo, for position1: possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, O, and also U, V, W, Y, Z, but less common. But we have O as a strong candidate because we know O is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, position2: cannot be O, and must be from the available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, U, V, W, Y, Z (and not the absent ones).\n\nPosition5: same as position1, but note that if position1 is O, then position5 cannot be O (if we assume no repetition, but we don\'t know). But the feedback doesn\'t indicate multiple O\'s, so we can try without repetition first.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that end with IN? Actually, the pattern is _ _ I N _, so the last two are fixed as I and N? No: positions 3 and 4 are I and N, so the word ends with the fourth letter as N, and then the fifth letter is unknown. So the word is of the form: [1][2] I N [5]\n\nCommon words: \n- If the fifth letter is G, then it could be ""something"" ING, like BRING, but B is allowed, but we have R absent? R is absent, so BRING is out. Similarly, THING: T is absent. FLING: F is allowed, L is allowed, but we have to check.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\nWe know the word must have an O. So the O must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: O in position 1.\nThen the word is: O [2] I N [5]\nPosition2: cannot be O (we know), and must be a consonant or vowel? But we have few vowels left: U or Y? Because A, E, I (I is at position3) are out. So position2 must be a consonant.\n\nPossible words: \n- OMIN? But that\'s 4 letters, we need 5: O _ I N _ \n  Examples: \n  - OMEN? But E is absent.\n  - OVINE: O V I N E -> but E is absent, so no.\n  - OMINA? But that\'s 5 letters: O M I N A -> but A is absent.\n  - OUNCE? O U N C E -> but positions: O at1, U at2, N at3? But we need position3 to be I, not N. So no.\n\nWe need position3 to be I and position4 to be N. So the word must have I at 3 and N at 4.\n\nSo for O at position1: O [2] I N [5]\n\nWhat can [2] be? It must be a letter that forms a word with O and then IN. Examples:\n- JOIN? But J O I N -> that\'s 4 letters. We need 5: so it must be JOIN followed by something? No, 5-letter word.\n\n5-letter words starting with O and having I at position3 and N at position4:\n- OBANG? Not a common word.\n- OCHIN? Not common.\n- OMINA? O-M-I-N-A, but A is absent.\n- OVINE: O-V-I-N-E, but E is absent.\n\nI\'m struggling. Maybe O at position1 is not common.\n\nCase 2: O in position5.\nThen the word is: [1] [2] I N O\n\nSo it ends with INO? Like words ending in INO: but that\'s usually for names or specific words.\n\nExamples:\n- MINO? 4 letters.\n- 5-letter words: \n  - CASINO? But C-A-S-I-N-O -> positions: C1, A2, S3? But we need I at position3 and N at4. Here, S is at3? No, and S is absent.\n  - We need [1][2] I N O, so the last three are I, N, O.\n\nWords: \n- BINGO? B-I-N-G-O -> positions: B1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.\n- We need: position1: ?, position2: ?, position3: I, position4: N, position5: O.\n\nSo the word ends with ""INO"".\n\nExamples of 5-letter words ending with INO:\n- CONDO: C-O-N-D-O -> positions: C1, O2, N3, D4, O5 -> but we need N at position4, here it\'s at3. And position3 is N, not I. So no.\n- We need the pattern: [1][2] I N O.\n\nSo: \n- position3: I\n- position4: N\n- position5: O\n\nSo the last three letters are ""INO"".\n\nNow, what words have that? \n- CASINO: C A S I N O -> positions: 1-C, 2-A, 3-S, 4-I, 5-N, 6-O? Wait, that\'s 6 letters. Casino is 6 letters? No, C-A-S-I-N-O is 6 letters? C-A-S-I-N-O: C(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), N(5), O(6) — 6 letters. So not 5.\n\n5-letter words ending with INO:\n- MINO? 4 letters.\n- There is ""KINO"", but that\'s K-I-N-O, which is 4 letters? Or 5? K-I-N-O is 4. We need 5 letters.\n\nActually, let\'s think: \n- The word must be 5 letters: letter1, letter2, I, N, O.\n\nSo: [1][2] I N O\n\nNow, what are some English words?\n- BIINO? Not a word.\n- CHINO: C-H-I-N-O -> that\'s 5 letters: C1, H2, I3, N4, O5 -> perfect! And C and H are not in the absent list.\n\nCHINO is a word (a type of cloth or khaki).\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- RHINO: R-H-I-N-O -> but R is absent, so no.\n- SHINO? Not common, and S is absent.\n- THINO? Not a word.\n- WHINO? Not a word.\n\nAnother one: \n- ALGIN? But that ends with GIN, not INO.\n\nWhat about ""VINHO""? Not English.\n\nSo CHINO seems a candidate.\n\nBut we have to check if it fits: \n- Position1: C\n- Position2: H\n- Position3: I (correct)\n- Position4: N (correct)\n- Position5: O\n\nAnd we know O is present and not in position2 (which it isn\'t, it\'s in position5) and we know O is in the word.\n\nAlso, C and H are new letters.\n\nBut is there another possibility? What if the word has O in position1? We had trouble, but let\'s try again.\n\nIf O is in position1: O [2] I N [5]\n\n[2] must be a letter that forms a word. Examples:\n- OMINA: but A is absent.\n- OVINE: E is absent.\n- ORCIN: O-R-C-I-N -> but R is absent.\n- OLDIN? Not a word.\n- OUNCE: O-U-N-C-E -> positions: O1, U2, N3, C4, E5 -> but we need position3 to be I, not N. And position4 is C, not N. So no.\n\nSo it seems difficult. Maybe O at position1 is not feasible.\n\nAnother word: DOING? D-O-I-N-G -> positions: D1, O2, I3, N4, G5 -> that fits the pattern! But in POINT, we had O in position2 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position. But in DOING, O is in position2, which was the same position as in POINT? In POINT, O was in position2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s not in position2 in the secret word. So if we put O in position2 again, it would be wrong.\n\nBut in DOING, O is at position2, which is the same as in POINT, and we know from POINT that O is not in position2. Therefore, DOING cannot be the word because it has O in position2.\n\nSimilarly, any word with O in position2 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern O [2] I N [5], we must have [2] not O, which we know, but also O cannot be in position2, so that\'s fine. But we need a word that starts with O and has I at3 and N at4.\n\nBut as above, I can\'t find a common word. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that O is in position5, so the word is [1][2] I N O.\n\nAnd we have CHINO as a candidate.\n\nBut are there others?\n- KHINO? Not English.\n- PHINO? No.\n- FLINO? No.\n- BLINO? No.\n- So CHINO seems the only common one.\n\nBut CHINO: C and H are not ruled out.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But in CHINO, all letters are distinct and no conflict.\n\nAnother word: ""QUINO""? Not common.\n\nSo probably CHINO is a good candidate.\n\nBut we have only one guess so far that fits, but we need to make a guess that might not be the solution but gives more information? We have 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.\n\nAlternatively, we could make a guess that tests more letters, but we have the pattern and we know O must be in position5, so if we guess CHINO, it might be the word.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWhat about if the word has O in position1? We must not rule it out completely.\n\nFor example, ""OCTIN""? Not a word.\n\n""OXBOW"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""OFLIN""? Not a word.\n\nSo it seems very limited.\n\nAnother word ending with INO: ""BENZO"" but that\'s B-E-N-Z-O, which has E and positions: B1, E2, N3, Z4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not N. And E is absent.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the most likely word is CHINO.\n\nBut we can also think of words that might have O in position1 but we haven\'t considered. For example, ""OAKEN"" but E is absent and positions don\'t match.\n\nI think CHINO is the best bet.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is CHINO.\n\nIf we guess CHINO:\n- C: new letter, if the word is CHINO, it would be correct at position1? But we don\'t know if it\'s correct. In the secret word, if it is CHINO, then C would be ✓, H would be ✓, I ✓, N ✓, O ✓.\n\nBut if it\'s not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we have to consider that there might be other words.\n\nAnother possibility: the word might have O in position1 and a different letter in position5.\n\nFor example, ""OMIN?"" but not 5 letters.\n\n""ORPIN"": O-R-P-I-N -> but R and P are absent.\n\n""ODLIN""? Not a word.\n\nI think it\'s safe to go with CHINO.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that might not be the word but helps eliminate.\n\nSince we have only a few possibilities, we can guess CHINO directly.\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback that tells us about C and H.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess CHINO and it\'s not the word, we might get:\n\n- If C is present or not, and H, etc.\n\nBut we know the pattern is _ _ I N O, so the word ends with INO.\n\nWhat are all 5-letter English words ending with INO?\n\n- CHINO (as above)\n- There is also ""KINO"", but that\'s 4 letters? Or ""kino"" can be 4, but sometimes extended? No, 4.\n- ""PINO"" 4 letters.\n- ""VINO"" 4 letters.\n\nIn 5 letters, I think CHINO is the only common one.\n\nBut there is ""LINGO"", but L-I-N-G-O -> positions: L1, I2, N3, G4, O5 -> but we need I at position3, not 2. And N at4, not 3. So no.\n\n""BINGO"" same issue.\n\nSo I think CHINO is the only common word that fits.\n\nTherefore, I will guess CHINO.\n\nBut to be thorough, let\'s consider if the word has a repeated letter? For example, if O appears twice? But in the pattern, if O is in position1 and position5, then the word would be O [2] I N O.\n\nBut [2] must be a letter that works. For example, ""ONION"": O-N-I-O-N -> positions: O1, N2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need position4 to be N, not O. And position2 is N, which is fixed? No, position4 must be N, but in ONION, position4 is O, not N. So no.\n\n""OZONI""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think CHINO is the only reasonable guess.\n\nThus, we go with CHINO.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)  \n  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - **R, A, S, E** are absent from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: POINT** → Feedback: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - **I** is confirmed at position 3 (✓).  \n  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (✓).  \n  - **O** is in the word but misplaced (not at position 2) (-).  \n  - **P** and **T** are absent.  \n\n### Deductions\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 3 must be **I**.  \n   - Position 4 must be **N**.  \n   - So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ I N _`.  \n\n2. **Confirmed present letters**:  \n   - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (from POINT feedback).

We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. **RAISE**: R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(x), E(x)
   - I is in the word at position 3.
   - R, A, S, E are absent.

2. **POINT**: P(x), O(-), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)
   - I (position 3) and N (position 4) are correct.
   - O is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1 or 5, since positions 3 and 4 are fixed).
   - P and T are absent.

3. **CHINO**: C(x), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), O(-)
   - I (position 3) and N (position 4) are still correct.
   - C and H are absent.
   - O is present but misplaced. Since in CHINO, O is at position 5, the feedback O(-) means O is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, O must be at position 1 (the only other possibility).

From this, we conclude:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ I N _ 
- Position 1: Must be O (since O is present and not at 2,3,4,5? But positions: 3 is I, 4 is N, so position 1 or 5 were candidates. But now O is not at 5 (from CHINO feedback), so it must be at position 1).

Wait, CHINO has O at position 5 and got O(-), meaning that O is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, O must be in the word at a different position. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N, and position 2 cannot have O (from POINT feedback where O was at position 2 and got (-)), then the only position left is position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be O.

So the pattern is: O _ I N _ 

Also, we now know the absences:
- Absent letters: R, A, S, E, P, T, C, H.

So the word is: O _ I N _ where the second position and fifth position need to be guessed.

Constraints on the letters:
- Position 2: Cannot be O (already used?), and must not be any absent letter. Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, Z (since R,A,S,E,P,T,C,H are out).
- Position 5: Same available letters.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that fits: O _ I N _

Possible words:
- OB... or OD... etc.

Common words:
- OMINA? But A is absent.
- OVINE? But E is absent.
- OPIUM? But P is absent (from Guess 2).
- OZONE? But O repeats? And E is absent.

OZONE: O1, Z2, O3, N4, E5 -> but position 3 must be I, not O. And position 4 must be N, which it is, but position 3 is O? No.

The pattern is O _ I N _, so position 3 is I: O [x] I N [y]

So letters: position1: O, position2: ?, position3: I, position4: N, position5: ?

List:
- OMINA: O-M-I-N-A -> but A is absent.
- OVINE: O-V-I-N-E -> but E is absent.
- OBIAS: O-B-I-A-S -> but A and S are absent.
- OIDIA: O-I-D-I-A -> but D is allowed? But we have I repeated? And A absent. Also, position 2 is I? But position 3 is I? That might be possible if double I, but in pattern: O I D I A? Positions: O1, I2, D3? But we need position 3 to be I, so if at position 2 is I, then position 3 would be D? But position 3 must be I, so I at position 2 would conflict? No, the pattern is position 3 fixed as I.

So words must have I at position 3.

Another: DOING? But D-O-I-N-G -> O at position 2? But in POINT, we had O at position 2 and got (-), meaning O should not be at position 2. And D is allowed? But DOING: O is at position 2, which is invalid.

Moreover, in DOING: positions 1-D, 2-O, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G.

But we know O cannot be at position 2, so DOING is invalid.

What about ""OFLIN"" not a word.

""OWING"": O-W-I-N-G -> positions: O1, W2, I3, N4, G5 -> that fits! And no absent letters? W, G not absent? Absent letters: R,A,S,E,P,T,C,H. So W and G are allowed.

Similarly, ""OXBOW"" but positions don't fit.

""OWING"" seems a candidate.

Other words:
- ""OKINA"" -> O-K-I-N-A -> but A is absent? A is in absent list? Guess 1: A is absent? Yes, from RAISE.

So no.

- ""OMINY"" not a word.

- ""OZONI"" not a word.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" but we have E absent? And positions: O-U-N-C-E -> N at position 3? But we need I at position 3? No.

We need position 3 is I.

""OWING"": O W I N G

Checking against constraints:
- Position 1: O? Should be O, so if we guess it, might be correct?
- Position 2: W? To be tested.
- Position 5: G? To be tested.
- Absent letters: W and G are not in the absent list? Absent lists: R,A,S,E,P,T,C,H. So W and G are free.

Another word: ""OLIVE"" but V is allowed, but E absent? Also, OLIVE: O-L-I-V-E -> position 4 is V? But we need position 4 to be N. So no, pattern requires N at 4.

Similarly, ""OCCUR"" has C and R absent.

So ""OWING"" seems good.

Another word: ""ORCIN"" but R is absent.

""ODDIN"" not a word.

So OWING is a possible word.

But we have to make a guess. Since we have pattern O _ I N _, and OWING fits, we can guess that.

But note: We know O is at position 1? Not necessarily, but from the deduction above: Since O cannot be at position 2 (from POINT) and cannot be at position 5 (from CHINO), and positions 3 and 4 are fixed, so position 1 must be O.

In OWING, position 1 is O, which should be correct.

Therefore, if we guess OWING:
- O should be correct at position 1 (since we deduced it must be there).
- W at position 2: could be correct or not?
- I and N correct.
- G at position 5: could be?

But we need to confirm.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests other letters, but we are limited.

Another possibility: ""OLEIN"" but L and E? E is absent.

So OWING seems best.

But let's see if there are others.

""OYING""? Not a word.

""OWINN""? Not a word.

""AWING"" would have A absent? No, position 1 must be O.

So OWING is valid.

We can guess OWING.

But wait, in CHINO, we got O(-) for position 5, which confirmed O is not at 5, implying O is at 1.

So in OWING, if we guess:
- Position 1: O should be ✓
- Position 2: W - unknown
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: N ✓
- Position 5: G - unknown

This might be correct.

We are on guess 4, so we have more tries if not.

But since OWING is a common word, we guess it.

Another word: ""OPING"" but P is absent? From guess 2, P(x).

So no.

Thus, OWING.

So let's go with that.

- **Guess 2: POINT → Feedback: P(x) O(-) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)**  
  - `I` (position 3) and `N` (position 4) are correct.  
  - `O` is present but not at position 2.  
  - `P`, `T` are absent.  
- **Guess 3: CHINO → Feedback: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) O(-)**  
  - `I` (position 3) and `N` (position 4) remain correct.  
  - `C`, `H` are absent.  
  - `O` is present but not at position 5.  

### Deductions  
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3: `I`  
   - Position 4: `N`  
   - Secret word pattern: `_ _ I N _`  

2. **Present letters**:  
   - `O` is in the word but not at position 2 (from POINT) or 5 (from CHINO). Since positions 3–4 are fixed, **`O` must be at position 1**.  
   - Updated pattern: **`O _ I N _`**  

3. **Absent letters**: `R, A, S, E, P, T, C, H` → Cannot be reused.  

4. **Constraints for remaining positions**:  
   - Position 2: Cannot be `O` and must be an unused letter (e.g., `B, D, F, G, K, L, M, W, Y`).  
   - Position 5: Must be an unused letter (same pool).  
   - All letters must form a valid English word satisfying `O _ I N _`.  

5. **Possible words**:  
   - Candidates like `OWING` (O W I N G), `ODYLE` (invalid), or `OMINA` (invalid due to `A`).  
   - `OWING` is valid: Common, fits the pattern, and tests new letters (`W`, `G`).  

### Strategy for Guess 4  
- **Goal**: Test `OWING` as it aligns with all constraints:  
  - Position 1: `O` (deduced as correct).  
  - Positions 3–4: `I`, `N` (confirmed).  
  - Positions 2 and 5: New letters (`W`, `G`) to gain feedback and narrow options.  
- If incorrect, feedback on `W` and `G` will solve the word in subsequent guesses.
