We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C(✓) : C is correct and in the right position (position 1)
  R(x) : R is not in the word
  A(x) : A is not in the word
  N(x) : N is not in the word
  E(✓) : E is correct and in the right position (position 5)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter C at position 1 and E at position 5: C _ _ _ E
- The letters R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we must avoid using R, A, N in our next guesses.

Now, we need to think of a 5-letter word that fits the pattern C _ _ _ E, and doesn't contain R, A, or N.

Let's list possible letters for the remaining positions (2,3,4). We should use common letters that haven't been tested yet.

Letters we have tested and are absent: A, R, N (and note, C and E are present and fixed in positions 1 and 5).

Other common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, but note:
- Since position 1 is C and position 5 is E, we need letters for the middle.

Possible patterns: C _ _ _ E

We want to test new letters to gather more information. We should avoid repeating the absent letters R, A, N.

Let's try to think of common words that start with C and end with E.

Examples:
- CHOSE: H, O, S? But note we have to check if these letters are allowed (not R,A,N).
- CLOVE: L, O, V? 
- etc.

But we want to cover letters that are frequent to maximize information.

Another idea: Since we know C and E are fixed, we can try a word that uses common vowels and consonants in the middle.

Looking at vowels: O, U, I (A is already absent, so we avoid A).

However, we don't know if there are other vowels. Also, consonants.

Let me list some candidate words:

- CHIME: H, I, M -> but M? We haven't tested M, but we know A,R,N are bad. So H,I,M are new.
- CHOLE: not common? 
- CHOKE: H, O, K
- CLIME: L, I, M
- COGUE: not common?

We should choose a word that has unique letters (avoid duplicates) to test more letters.

Another idea: ""CLOSE"" - O, S, L? But we don't know if L, O, S are in or not.

Wait, but note: our goal is to test letters. We are constrained by the pattern C _ _ _ E, so it's not just any word.

Actually, the word must start with C and end with E.

Let me think of words: CABLE? But B,L? But A is absent -> we know A is absent so CABLE has an A which is bad? Also, ""CABLE"" has A -> which we know is absent, so we cannot use A.

Therefore, avoid words containing A, R, N.

So possible words:

- CEDED? not 5 distinct? and D repeats? Also, we want to test more letters.

But note: E is already at the end, but we can have E elsewhere? Actually, no: the feedback tells us that E is at the end and we don't know about other Es. However, the feedback for E was ✓ in position 5, but it doesn't say if there are other Es. So we could have another E in the word? But the pattern is C _ _ _ E, so middle positions could have E? But that would be duplicate E? However, that's allowed.

But to maximize information, let's avoid duplicates for now.

So let's pick a word with new letters. We haven't tested: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, let's look for common words matching C _ _ _ E without A,R,N.

Some candidates:
- CHIME: H, I, M
- CHOKE: H, O, K
- CLIME: L, I, M
- COPSE: O, P, S
- COTTE? not common
- COVET? but V? ends with T? no, we need E at the end.
- COWPE? not common

Better: ""CLOSE"" doesn't end with E.

Let me think: words ending with E: 
- COMME? not English.
- CHOSE: H, O, S -> C H O S E -> this has S,O,H. 

But ""CHOSE"" is a word? Wait, it's the past tense of choose? Yes.

Similarly, ""COPSE"" is a word (a thicket of trees).

We want to test letters that are frequent.

Another: ""CYCLE"" -> but Y,C,L? C is repeated? and we already know C is present? But we can use it? Actually, no: we are trying to get new information, but C is at position 1, so if we use C again, and it's not in the secret word elsewhere, it might show as absent? However, in CHOSE, the C is at the beginning so will be ✓, and then we have the middle letters: H,O,S.

But ""CHOSE"": positions:
  C (1) -> ✓ (we know)
  H (2) -> ?
  O (3) -> ?
  S (4) -> ?
  E (5) -> ✓ (we know)

We hope to get feedback on H, O, S.

But note: CHOSE does not contain any of A,R,N? Correct.

Alternatively: ""CLIME"" -> L, I, M -> also valid.

But which one? 

To decide, we can consider letter frequencies in English.

Common consonants: T, H, L, S, N, R (but R and N are already out, so H, L, S, T are common).

Vowels: O, I, U.

So CHOSE has H, O, S -> O is a common vowel, H and S are common consonants.

CLIME has L, I, M -> L is common, I is vowel, M is less common than S? 

According to English letter frequencies:
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, ... (but we know A,N,R are out).

So then S is more common than M.

Therefore, CHOSE might be better. Also, O is a common vowel.

Another possibility: ""CHIVE""? H,I,V -> V is less common.

""CHOSE"" seems good.

So I will choose ""CHOSE"" for the second guess.

So the word is ""CHOSE""

Structure: C H O S E

We expect:
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (already known)
- Position 5: E -> ✓ (already known)

We will get feedback for positions 2,3,4: H, O, S.

This will tell us which of these letters are in the secret word and in what relative positions.

But note: it's possible that one or more of these are not in the word, or are in the word but not at that position.

Therefore, we make the guess: CHOSE

So the response format: We output the guess.

But note: we must avoid using A,R,N.

So <guess>chose</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C (✓)**: The letter C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- **R (x)**: The letter R is not in the word.
- **A (x)**: The letter A is not in the word.
- **N (x)**: The letter N is not in the word.
- **E (✓)**: The letter E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

This means:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `C _ _ _ E`.
2. The letters R, A, and N are absent from the word entirely.
3. The next guess must start with C and end with E, while avoiding R, A, and N.

For this guess, I chose **""chose""** because:
- It fits the pattern (`C _ _ _ E`) with new untested letters (H, O, S).
- Uses common English letters (H, O, S) to maximize information gain.
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters (R, A, N are not used).

Similarly, ""COPSE"" is a word (a thicket of trees).

We want to test letters that are frequent.

Another: ""CYCLE"" -> but Y,C,L? C is repeated? and we already know C is present? But we can use it? Actually, no: we are trying to get new information, but C is at position 1, so if we use C again, and it's not in the secret word elsewhere, it might show as absent? However, in CHOSE, the C is at the beginning so will be ✓, and then we have the middle letters: H,O,S.

But ""CHOSE"": positions:
  C (1) -> ✓ (we know)
  H (2) -> ?
  O (3) -> ?
  S (4) -> ?
  E (5) -> ✓ (we know)

We hope to get feedback on H, O, S.

But note: CHOSE does not contain any of A,R,N? Correct.

Alternatively: ""CLIME"" -> L, I, M -> also valid.

But which one? 

To decide, we can consider letter frequencies in English.

Common consonants: T, H, L, S, N, R (but R and N are already out, so H, L, S, T are common).

Vowels: O, I, U.

So CHOSE has H, O, S -> O is a common vowel, H and S are common consonants.

CLIME has L, I, M -> L is common, I is vowel, M is less common than S? 

According to English letter frequencies:
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, ... (but we know A,N,R are out).

So then S is more common than M.

Therefore, CHOSE might be better. Also, O is a common vowel.

Another possibility: ""CHIVE""? H,I,V -> V is less common.

""CHOSE"" seems good.

So I will choose ""CHOSE"" for the second guess.

So the word is ""CHOSE""

Structure: C H O S E

We expect:
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (already known)
- Position 5: E -> ✓ (already known)

We will get feedback for positions 2,3,4: H, O, S.

This will tell us which of these letters are in the secret word and in what relative positions.

But note: it's possible that one or more of these are not in the word, or are in the word but not at that position.

Therefore, we make the guess: CHOSE

So the response format: We output the guess.

But note: we must avoid using A,R,N.

So <guess>chose</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C (✓)**: The letter C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- **R (x)**: The letter R is not in the word.
- **A (x)**: The letter A is not in the word.
- **N (x)**: The letter N is not in the word.
- **E (✓)**: The letter E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

This means:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `C _ _ _ E`.
2. The letters R, A, and N are absent from the word entirely.
3. The next guess must start with C and end with E, while avoiding R, A, and N.

For this guess, I chose **""chose""** because:
- It fits the pattern (`C _ _ _ E`) with new untested letters (H, O, S).
- Uses common English letters (H, O, S) to maximize information gain.
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters (R, A, N are not used).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) 
This tells us:
- C is in the word at position 1.
- E is in the word at position 5.
- R, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E, and it does not contain R, A, or N.

Guess 2: chose -> C(✓) H(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- C at position 1 is correct (already known).
- H at position 2: is not in the word at all (x).
- O at position 3: is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So position 3 is O.
- S at position 4: is not in the word at all (x).
- E at position 5 is correct (already known).

So now we know:
- The word is C O _ _ E (since position 3 is O, and we have C at 1 and E at 5).
- Additionally, we know that R, A, N, H, S are not in the word.

Therefore, the full pattern so far: C O _ _ E.

We need to fill the 3rd and 4th positions. Actually, wait: positions are:
1: C
2: ? (but now we know it cannot be H, and also must not be R,A,N,S, and H is added to absent letters)
3: O (now known)
4: ? (we now know it's not S, and must avoid the other absent letters)
5: E

Actually, position 2 and position 4 are unknown.

But we know position 3 is O.

So the pattern is: C O _ _ E? No: we have 5 positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=O, 4=?, 5=E.

So the pattern: C ? O ? E -> wait, no: in ""chose"", the O was at position 3, which is the third letter.

The positions:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: [unknown, but we tried H and it's not in the word]
- Position 3: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: [unknown, we tried S and it's not in the word]
- Position 5: E

So the pattern is: C _ O _ E? Actually, the word has five letters: letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4, letter5.

So pattern: letter1 = C, letter3 = O, letter5 = E.

We need to guess letter2 and letter4.

Additionally, we know the word doesn't contain: R, A, N, H, S.

Now, we must use a word that fits: C ? O ? E, and the ? positions must not be R,A,N,H,S, and we cannot use any of these letters anywhere.

In fact, the entire word must consist of letters that are not R, A, N, H, S.

We also don't know if there are other constraints from previous feedback? No, only from the absent letters.

But note: after guess2, we have feedback that H is absent and S is absent. So they join the list of bad letters.

So absent letters: R, A, N, H, S.

Therefore, available letters: all others except C, O, E (which we know are in the word, but we might use C and O again? Because we know they are present, but the positions: C is at 1, O at 3, E at 5. However, we cannot have duplicate C? We don't know yet.

But because feedback for guess1: C was in the correct position, and guess2: C is still correct, so most likely no duplicate? But it could have duplicate? However, we haven't seen evidence of duplicates.

But in the pattern, we don't require duplicates, and since we are trying to fill positions 2 and 4, we can try letters we haven't tested yet.

So we need to choose a word that has:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: some letter not in {A,R,N,H,S} (and also not O,E? But we can use if necessary? Actually, E is at 5, O at 3, so position 2 could be another O? But we don't know. Actually, yes, it could be O? But unless the word has two Os? But then feedback might show O in position3 is correct and position2 might be marked as present but not correct? But we haven't seen such situation.

Since position2 in guess2 was H and it was absent, and position4 was S and absent, and we have fixed O at position3.

So we need a word: C ? O ? E

Where ? at position2 is a letter not in {A,R,N,H,S} and ? at position4 is a letter not in {A,R,N,H,S}. Also, the entire word must not contain any absent letters.

Moreover, we must avoid letters we know are absent: so no R,A,N,H,S.

Now, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E (in guess1), and H,O,S (in guess2). So we know about C,O,E being present (and in specific positions) and R,A,N,H,S being absent.

Now, we must test letters for positions 2 and 4 that we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to form a valid English word that is 5 letters: C _ O _ E.

So, for position2: can be one of these letters, and position4: one of these letters.

We can try to think of common words.

For example:
- COWPE? Not common.
- COTED? Not familiar.
- COMET? But that would be C O M E T, but pattern: position1=C, position2=O? But we need position3 to be O? No: in our pattern position3 is fixed O, so COMET has O at position2? But we need position3=O, but in COMET: letter2 is O? Then pattern: C O M E T -> position3 is M? So that doesn't fit: we need the third letter to be O.

Our pattern requires the third letter to be O: so the word must be C [letter2] O [letter4] E.

So the template is: C ? O ? E.

What words fit this? And use letters only from the available set.

Examples:
- COMET: C O M E T -> doesn't fit: because we need position3=O but this has O at position2? So no: position1=C, position2=O, position3=M, ... -> pattern is C O ? ? E? No: COMET: position1=C, 2=O, 3=M, 4=E, 5=T? So that doesn't have position3=O? We require position3=O.

We need: C ? O ? E -> so the third letter must be O, not the second.

So let me think: words that have the pattern: letter1=C, letter3=O, letter5=E.

Such as:
- CHORE? But H and R are bad -> avoid.
- CLONE? But L and N? N is absent -> so no.
- CLOTE? Not a word.

Another: C H O R E? But H is bad and R is bad.

But we don't want absent letters.

So let's try: using available letters.

What about: ""COGUE""? Not a common word.

Perhaps: ""COLLE""? Not 5 distinct? Also, L repeated? But we might have duplicates.

I know: ""COMET"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""COZEN""? C O Z E N? But N is absent? And pattern: position1=C,2=O,3=Z? So no, position3 is Z? We require O at position3.

So we need: the word must be: C [letter2] O [letter4] E.

For example:
- C R O N E? But R and N are bad -> invalid.
- C A V O E? But A is bad -> invalid.

Without the bad letters: the word must be C [not R,A,N,H,S] O [not R,A,N,H,S] E.

So possible: 
Let position2 be one of: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Let position4 be one of: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And form a word.

Common words:
- ""COMAE""? Not common? And we have E at the end? But it's plural of coma? and ends with E? C O M A E -> but A is bad -> invalid.

Without A: 
- ""CODE"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters: so 5 letter word.

Another: ""COMES""? C O M E S -> S is bad -> invalid? Also, S at position5? But our pattern ends with E, and then? We need position5=E? But ""COMES"": position1=C,2=O,3=M,4=E,5=S? So that has S at the end -> fails because we need E at the end? And we know E is at position5.

Actually, in ""COMES"", the E is at position4? So pattern: position1=C,2=O,3=M,4=E,5=S -> that doesn't have position5=E? And position3=M? So doesn't fit our pattern.

We need:
- Position3 must be O -> so position1=C, position2=?, position3=O, position4=?, position5=E.

So the word: C ? O ? E.

A common word: ""C O M I E""? Not word? 

Another: ""COPED""? C O P E D -> position1=C,2=O,3=P, etc. -> again position3 is P? Not O.

But we require position3=O: the third letter must be O.

So let me think of words where the third letter is O? And pattern C * O * E?

Examples:
- ""ABOVE"" -> doesn't start with C? 
Actually, starting with C: 
- ""CLOVE"": C L O V E -> Oh! Look: 
  position1: C
  position2: L
  position3: O -> required O here? Yes, if O is at position3? But ""CLOVE"": C-L-O-V-E -> positions: 
    1: C, 
    2: L, 
    3: O, 
    4: V, 
    5: E.

Yes! So this has C, O (at3), and E? And ends with E? Position5=E? Yes.

Now, letters: C, L, O, V, E.

But we know O and E are already in the word? But O is at position3 and E at position5? And what about C? We know C is at1.

But L and V: we haven't tested? And they are not in the bad letters (bad letters: R, A, N, H, S). So L and V are available.

Additionally, the word ""CLOVE"" is a valid English word (meaning a clove of garlic, or a spice).

Therefore, we can guess ""CLOVE"".

But what about duplicate letters? We know the word has C, O, and E already? Could it have other copies? But ""CLOVE"" doesn't duplicate any? It has one each? So it's fine.

We can use this to test L and V.

Another possibility: ""COVET""? C O V E T? Positions: 
1=C, 2=O, 3=V? -> position3=V? We require O at position3? So no.

""COVET"" has position3=V? So doesn't fit.

Another: ""DROVE"" -> doesn't start with C.

""GLOVE"" -> starts with G.

So ""CLOVE"" fits nicely.

Another: ""CHOKE""? But H is bad? And S? But we have ""CHOKE"": C H O K E -> has H? And we know H is absent -> not allowed.

Another: ""CLOTE""? Not a word.

""COUPE"": C O U P E -> positions: 
1=C, 2=O, 3=U? -> position3=U? So not O at position3? So doesn't fit.

Therefore, ""CLOVE"" is a good candidate.

So we'll guess ""CLOVE"".

But we haven't tried many letters? But we are focusing on getting the word that matches the known pattern to solve quicker? Yes.

Alternatively, if we want to test more letters? But we only have two positions open? And if we guess correctly, we win? So we can try ""CLOVE"".

But note: the secret word might be ""CLOVE""? Or something else? But we don't know? But this is a possible candidate.

But there might be other words? Like:

- ""CLONE"": but L,O,N,E? But N is absent -> so invalid? Also, we know N is absent.

- ""CROME""? Not word.

- ""CHOSE"": we tried that? We did: guess2 was chose, and failed? But ""CHOVE""? Not a word? 

So ""CLOVE"" is a good choice.

So we'll go with ""CLOVE"".

Thus the format: <guess>clove</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Knowledge from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: crane → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**:
     - **C** is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.
     - **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
     - **R, A, N** are absent from the word.
     - Deduced pattern: `C _ _ _ E`.
   - **Guess 2: chose → C(✓) H(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)**:
     - **C** and **E** remain correctly placed (positions 1 and 5).
     - **O** is now confirmed in position 3 and correct.
     - **H** and **S** are absent from the word.
     - Updated pattern: `C _ O _ E`.
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, H, S (must be avoided).
   - **Present and placed letters**: C (pos 1), O (pos 3), E (pos 5).
   - **Unknown positions**: Letters for position 2 and position 4.

2. The pattern `C _ O _ E` narrows down the word to 5-letter English words starting with `C`, ending with `E`, with `O` as the 3rd letter.  
   - Examples include ""close"", ""clone"", ""clove"", ""covey"", but must exclude words with absent letters (R, A, N, H, S).

3. **Choosing the Next Guess**:
   - Position 2 must be a letter not absent (avoid R, A, N, H, S). Candidates include B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4 must also avoid absent letters.
   - Common words fitting the pattern:
     - **""CLONE""**: Invalid (contains N, which is absent).
     - **""CLOSE""**: Invalid (contains S, which is absent).
     - **""CLOVE""**: Valid (no absent letters; L and V are untested, common letters).
     - **""COVET""**: Invalid (pattern is `C O V E T` → position 3 is V, not O, so it doesn't fit `C _ O _ E`).
     - **""COMET""**: Invalid (pattern is `C O M E T` → position 3 is M, not O).
   - **""CLOVE""** is a strong candidate:
     - Tests new common letters (L at position 2, V at position 4).
     - Aligns with the `C _ O _ E` pattern.
     - Maximizes information: Even if incorrect, feedback on L and V will clarify the word.

4. **Decision**: Guess **""CLOVE""** to efficiently test the pattern while gathering new information on untested letters (L, V).

Guess 1: crane -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) 
This tells us:
- C is in the word at position 1.
- E is in the word at position 5.
- R, A, N are not in the word.

Thus, the secret word pattern is C _ _ _ E, and it does not contain R, A, or N.

Guess 2: chose -> C(✓) H(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- C at position 1 is correct (already known).
- H at position 2: is not in the word at all (x).
- O at position 3: is in the word and in the correct position (✓). So position 3 is O.
- S at position 4: is not in the word at all (x).
- E at position 5 is correct (already known).

So now we know:
- The word is C O _ _ E (since position 3 is O, and we have C at 1 and E at 5).
- Additionally, we know that R, A, N, H, S are not in the word.

Therefore, the full pattern so far: C O _ _ E.

We need to fill the 3rd and 4th positions. Actually, wait: positions are:
1: C
2: ? (but now we know it cannot be H, and also must not be R,A,N,S, and H is added to absent letters)
3: O (now known)
4: ? (we now know it's not S, and must avoid the other absent letters)
5: E

Actually, position 2 and position 4 are unknown.

But we know position 3 is O.

So the pattern is: C O _ _ E? No: we have 5 positions: 1=C, 2=?, 3=O, 4=?, 5=E.

So the pattern: C ? O ? E -> wait, no: in ""chose"", the O was at position 3, which is the third letter.

The positions:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: [unknown, but we tried H and it's not in the word]
- Position 3: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: [unknown, we tried S and it's not in the word]
- Position 5: E

So the pattern is: C _ O _ E? Actually, the word has five letters: letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4, letter5.

So pattern: letter1 = C, letter3 = O, letter5 = E.

We need to guess letter2 and letter4.

Additionally, we know the word doesn't contain: R, A, N, H, S.

Now, we must use a word that fits: C ? O ? E, and the ? positions must not be R,A,N,H,S, and we cannot use any of these letters anywhere.

In fact, the entire word must consist of letters that are not R, A, N, H, S.

We also don't know if there are other constraints from previous feedback? No, only from the absent letters.

But note: after guess2, we have feedback that H is absent and S is absent. So they join the list of bad letters.

So absent letters: R, A, N, H, S.

Therefore, available letters: all others except C, O, E (which we know are in the word, but we might use C and O again? Because we know they are present, but the positions: C is at 1, O at 3, E at 5. However, we cannot have duplicate C? We don't know yet.

But because feedback for guess1: C was in the correct position, and guess2: C is still correct, so most likely no duplicate? But it could have duplicate? However, we haven't seen evidence of duplicates.

But in the pattern, we don't require duplicates, and since we are trying to fill positions 2 and 4, we can try letters we haven't tested yet.

So we need to choose a word that has:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: some letter not in {A,R,N,H,S} (and also not O,E? But we can use if necessary? Actually, E is at 5, O at 3, so position 2 could be another O? But we don't know. Actually, yes, it could be O? But unless the word has two Os? But then feedback might show O in position3 is correct and position2 might be marked as present but not correct? But we haven't seen such situation.

Since position2 in guess2 was H and it was absent, and position4 was S and absent, and we have fixed O at position3.

So we need a word: C ? O ? E

Where ? at position2 is a letter not in {A,R,N,H,S} and ? at position4 is a letter not in {A,R,N,H,S}. Also, the entire word must not contain any absent letters.

Moreover, we must avoid letters we know are absent: so no R,A,N,H,S.

Now, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E (in guess1), and H,O,S (in guess2). So we know about C,O,E being present (and in specific positions) and R,A,N,H,S being absent.

Now, we must test letters for positions 2 and 4 that we haven't tried yet.

List of available letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to form a valid English word that is 5 letters: C _ O _ E.

So, for position2: can be one of these letters, and position4: one of these letters.

We can try to think of common words.

For example:
- COWPE? Not common.
- COTED? Not familiar.
- COMET? But that would be C O M E T, but pattern: position1=C, position2=O? But we need position3 to be O? No: in our pattern position3 is fixed O, so COMET has O at position2? But we need position3=O, but in COMET: letter2 is O? Then pattern: C O M E T -> position3 is M? So that doesn't fit: we need the third letter to be O.

Our pattern requires the third letter to be O: so the word must be C [letter2] O [letter4] E.

So the template is: C ? O ? E.

What words fit this? And use letters only from the available set.

Examples:
- COMET: C O M E T -> doesn't fit: because we need position3=O but this has O at position2? So no: position1=C, position2=O, position3=M, ... -> pattern is C O ? ? E? No: COMET: position1=C, 2=O, 3=M, 4=E, 5=T? So that doesn't have position3=O? We require position3=O.

We need: C ? O ? E -> so the third letter must be O, not the second.

So let me think: words that have the pattern: letter1=C, letter3=O, letter5=E.

Such as:
- CHORE? But H and R are bad -> avoid.
- CLONE? But L and N? N is absent -> so no.
- CLOTE? Not a word.

Another: C H O R E? But H is bad and R is bad.

But we don't want absent letters.

So let's try: using available letters.

What about: ""COGUE""? Not a common word.

Perhaps: ""COLLE""? Not 5 distinct? Also, L repeated? But we might have duplicates.

I know: ""COMET"" doesn't fit.

Another: ""COZEN""? C O Z E N? But N is absent? And pattern: position1=C,2=O,3=Z? So no, position3 is Z? We require O at position3.

So we need: the word must be: C [letter2] O [letter4] E.

For example:
- C R O N E? But R and N are bad -> invalid.
- C A V O E? But A is bad -> invalid.

Without the bad letters: the word must be C [not R,A,N,H,S] O [not R,A,N,H,S] E.

So possible: 
Let position2 be one of: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Let position4 be one of: B,D,F,G,I,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And form a word.

Common words:
- ""COMAE""? Not common? And we have E at the end? But it's plural of coma? and ends with E? C O M A E -> but A is bad -> invalid.

Without A: 
- ""CODE"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters: so 5 letter word.

Another: ""COMES""? C O M E S -> S is bad -> invalid? Also, S at position5? But our pattern ends with E, and then? We need position5=E? But ""COMES"": position1=C,2=O,3=M,4=E,5=S? So that has S at the end -> fails because we need E at the end? And we know E is at position5.

Actually, in ""COMES"", the E is at position4? So pattern: position1=C,2=O,3=M,4=E,5=S -> that doesn't have position5=E? And position3=M? So doesn't fit our pattern.

We need:
- Position3 must be O -> so position1=C, position2=?, position3=O, position4=?, position5=E.

So the word: C ? O ? E.

A common word: ""C O M I E""? Not word? 

Another: ""COPED""? C O P E D -> position1=C,2=O,3=P, etc. -> again position3 is P? Not O.

But we require position3=O: the third letter must be O.

So let me think of words where the third letter is O? And pattern C * O * E?

Examples:
- ""ABOVE"" -> doesn't start with C? 
Actually, starting with C: 
- ""CLOVE"": C L O V E -> Oh! Look: 
  position1: C
  position2: L
  position3: O -> required O here? Yes, if O is at position3? But ""CLOVE"": C-L-O-V-E -> positions: 
    1: C, 
    2: L, 
    3: O, 
    4: V, 
    5: E.

Yes! So this has C, O (at3), and E? And ends with E? Position5=E? Yes.

Now, letters: C, L, O, V, E.

But we know O and E are already in the word? But O is at position3 and E at position5? And what about C? We know C is at1.

But L and V: we haven't tested? And they are not in the bad letters (bad letters: R, A, N, H, S). So L and V are available.

Additionally, the word ""CLOVE"" is a valid English word (meaning a clove of garlic, or a spice).

Therefore, we can guess ""CLOVE"".

But what about duplicate letters? We know the word has C, O, and E already? Could it have other copies? But ""CLOVE"" doesn't duplicate any? It has one each? So it's fine.

We can use this to test L and V.

Another possibility: ""COVET""? C O V E T? Positions: 
1=C, 2=O, 3=V? -> position3=V? We require O at position3? So no.

""COVET"" has position3=V? So doesn't fit.

Another: ""DROVE"" -> doesn't start with C.

""GLOVE"" -> starts with G.

So ""CLOVE"" fits nicely.

Another: ""CHOKE""? But H is bad? And S? But we have ""CHOKE"": C H O K E -> has H? And we know H is absent -> not allowed.

Another: ""CLOTE""? Not a word.

""COUPE"": C O U P E -> positions: 
1=C, 2=O, 3=U? -> position3=U? So not O at position3? So doesn't fit.

Therefore, ""CLOVE"" is a good candidate.

So we'll guess ""CLOVE"".

But we haven't tried many letters? But we are focusing on getting the word that matches the known pattern to solve quicker? Yes.

Alternatively, if we want to test more letters? But we only have two positions open? And if we guess correctly, we win? So we can try ""CLOVE"".

But note: the secret word might be ""CLOVE""? Or something else? But we don't know? But this is a possible candidate.

But there might be other words? Like:

- ""CLONE"": but L,O,N,E? But N is absent -> so invalid? Also, we know N is absent.

- ""CROME""? Not word.

- ""CHOSE"": we tried that? We did: guess2 was chose, and failed? But ""CHOVE""? Not a word? 

So ""CLOVE"" is a good choice.

So we'll go with ""CLOVE"".

Thus the format: <guess>clove</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Knowledge from Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: crane → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**:
     - **C** is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.
     - **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
     - **R, A, N** are absent from the word.
     - Deduced pattern: `C _ _ _ E`.
   - **Guess 2: chose → C(✓) H(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)**:
     - **C** and **E** remain correctly placed (positions 1 and 5).
     - **O** is now confirmed in position 3 and correct.
     - **H** and **S** are absent from the word.
     - Updated pattern: `C _ O _ E`.
   - **Absent letters**: R, A, N, H, S (must be avoided).
   - **Present and placed letters**: C (pos 1), O (pos 3), E (pos 5).
   - **Unknown positions**: Letters for position 2 and position 4.

2. The pattern `C _ O _ E` narrows down the word to 5-letter English words starting with `C`, ending with `E`, with `O` as the 3rd letter.  
   - Examples include ""close"", ""clone"", ""clove"", ""covey"", but must exclude words with absent letters (R, A, N, H, S).

3. **Choosing the Next Guess**:
   - Position 2 must be a letter not absent (avoid R, A, N, H, S). Candidates include B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4 must also avoid absent letters.
   - Common words fitting the pattern:
     - **""CLONE""**: Invalid (contains N, which is absent).
     - **""CLOSE""**: Invalid (contains S, which is absent).
     - **""CLOVE""**: Valid (no absent letters; L and V are untested, common letters).
     - **""COVET""**: Invalid (pattern is `C O V E T` → position 3 is V, not O, so it doesn't fit `C _ O _ E`).
     - **""COMET""**: Invalid (pattern is `C O M E T` → position 3 is M, not O).
   - **""CLOVE""** is a strong candidate:
     - Tests new common letters (L at position 2, V at position 4).
     - Aligns with the `C _ O _ E` pattern.
     - Maximizes information: Even if incorrect, feedback on L and V will clarify the word.

4. **Decision**: Guess **""CLOVE""** to efficiently test the pattern while gathering new information on untested letters (L, V).",Guess 3: clove -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
