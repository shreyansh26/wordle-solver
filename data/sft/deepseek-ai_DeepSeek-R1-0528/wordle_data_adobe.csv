We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or use the known E).
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not 3 (since we know A is in the word, but not at position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, it could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that puts A in a different position (like position 1 or 2) and includes other common letters.

For example:
- We could try ""SAUTE"": 
  - S, A, U, T, E
  - Ends with E, has A at position 2 (which is a new position for A), and uses common letters.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Avoids C, R, N: yes.
- Contains A and E.

Alternatively, we could try ""PLATE"":
- P, L, A, T, E
- Ends with E, has A at position 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3 from the first guess? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's not correct. So that might not be efficient.

We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we want A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A in positions 1, 2, or 4:

- Position 1: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AGATE"", etc.
- Position 2: ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""HASTE"", etc.
- Position 4: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""SHADE"", etc.

We also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to find words that have A and also test other vowels or common consonants.

But note: we have only one vowel confirmed (A and E, but E is fixed at the end). We don't know about others.

Let me consider ""SAUTE"":
- S at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This tests:
- S: new letter
- A at position 2 (which we haven't tried before)
- U: new vowel
- T: common consonant

And avoids C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E. But then A is at position 2? Actually, in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2? Let's spell: P-A-S-T-E -> so A is at position 2.

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if A is at position 2 or not. We are testing.

Another option: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E. But we don't know if A is at 1.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, N are absent, so we must avoid them.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good choice because it tests multiple new letters and positions.

But let me check if ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to fry quickly in a little hot fat.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has S, L, A, T, E. However, we know that R is absent, but L is new. But wait, in ""SLATE"", the A is at position 3? S-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3. But we already know A is not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" would be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and not at the end (since end is E).

Let me think of words with A at position 1: ""ADOBE"", but that has O and B. Or ""AGAPE"", but that has G and P. Or ""ALATE"" (which means having wings) but that might be obscure.

More common: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", but ""AMAZE"" has M and Z, and Z is less common.

""ABUSE"": A at 1, B, U, S, E. This tests A at position 1, and letters B, U, S.

Similarly, ""ALIVE"": A at 1, L, I, V, E. Tests A at 1, and L, I, V.

But we also have the E at the end.

Another word: ""PAUSE"" — P, A, U, S, E. A at position 2? P-A-U-S-E -> A is at position 2.

So ""PAUSE"" has A at position 2.

I think ""PAUSE"" is a good option: it uses common letters and tests A at position 2.

But we have to avoid C, R, N, which we do.

Alternatively, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. This has A at position 3? S-H-A-D-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

So we want A at 1, 2, or 4.

""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? B-L-A-M-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""FLAME"": same, A at 3.

""SHAME"": S-H-A-M-E -> A at 3.

How about ""BEADY""? But that ends with Y, not E.

We need to end with E.

""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""OZONE"" has no A.

Let me think of words with A at position 4: 
- ""CAUSE"" but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.
- ""RAISE"" but R is absent.
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> but T is repeated? T-A-S-T-E -> two T's? And A is at position 2? T-A-S-T-E: positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E. So A is at 2.

""TASTE"" has A at position 2 and ends with E. But it has T at position 1 and 4. Also, we don't know about T.

But we can use it? However, we have to avoid R, C, N, which we do.

But it repeats T. It might be better to avoid repeated letters to get more information.

So non-repeated letters are better.

Back to ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. 
- A is at position 2 (which we haven't tested)
- Tests P, U, S (all new)
- Ends with E.

Similarly, ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> A at 2, tests S, U, T.

Both are good.

I think I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it has T which is a very common consonant.

So second guess: ""SAUTE""

We'll see if A is at position 2 or not, and also test S, U, T.

If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'.

But note: we already know A is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, if we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's at position 2. If not, then A must be at position 1 or 4 (since 5 is E and 3 we already tried).

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- End with E (to utilize the known position).
- Include A in a position that hasn't been tested yet (positions 1, 2, or 4, since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, U) to gather more information.

I chose ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (position 5).
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, U, and T.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether S, U, or T are in the word.

- Ends with E (to confirm or use the known E).
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not 3 (since we know A is in the word, but not at position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, it could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that puts A in a different position (like position 1 or 2) and includes other common letters.

For example:
- We could try ""SAUTE"": 
  - S, A, U, T, E
  - Ends with E, has A at position 2 (which is a new position for A), and uses common letters.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Avoids C, R, N: yes.
- Contains A and E.

Alternatively, we could try ""PLATE"":
- P, L, A, T, E
- Ends with E, has A at position 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3 from the first guess? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's not correct. So that might not be efficient.

We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we want A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A in positions 1, 2, or 4:

- Position 1: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AGATE"", etc.
- Position 2: ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""HASTE"", etc.
- Position 4: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""SHADE"", etc.

We also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to find words that have A and also test other vowels or common consonants.

But note: we have only one vowel confirmed (A and E, but E is fixed at the end). We don't know about others.

Let me consider ""SAUTE"":
- S at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This tests:
- S: new letter
- A at position 2 (which we haven't tried before)
- U: new vowel
- T: common consonant

And avoids C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E. But then A is at position 2? Actually, in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2? Let's spell: P-A-S-T-E -> so A is at position 2.

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if A is at position 2 or not. We are testing.

Another option: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E. But we don't know if A is at 1.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, N are absent, so we must avoid them.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good choice because it tests multiple new letters and positions.

But let me check if ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to fry quickly in a little hot fat.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has S, L, A, T, E. However, we know that R is absent, but L is new. But wait, in ""SLATE"", the A is at position 3? S-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3. But we already know A is not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" would be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and not at the end (since end is E).

Let me think of words with A at position 1: ""ADOBE"", but that has O and B. Or ""AGAPE"", but that has G and P. Or ""ALATE"" (which means having wings) but that might be obscure.

More common: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", but ""AMAZE"" has M and Z, and Z is less common.

""ABUSE"": A at 1, B, U, S, E. This tests A at position 1, and letters B, U, S.

Similarly, ""ALIVE"": A at 1, L, I, V, E. Tests A at 1, and L, I, V.

But we also have the E at the end.

Another word: ""PAUSE"" — P, A, U, S, E. A at position 2? P-A-U-S-E -> A is at position 2.

So ""PAUSE"" has A at position 2.

I think ""PAUSE"" is a good option: it uses common letters and tests A at position 2.

But we have to avoid C, R, N, which we do.

Alternatively, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. This has A at position 3? S-H-A-D-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

So we want A at 1, 2, or 4.

""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? B-L-A-M-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""FLAME"": same, A at 3.

""SHAME"": S-H-A-M-E -> A at 3.

How about ""BEADY""? But that ends with Y, not E.

We need to end with E.

""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""OZONE"" has no A.

Let me think of words with A at position 4: 
- ""CAUSE"" but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.
- ""RAISE"" but R is absent.
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> but T is repeated? T-A-S-T-E -> two T's? And A is at position 2? T-A-S-T-E: positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E. So A is at 2.

""TASTE"" has A at position 2 and ends with E. But it has T at position 1 and 4. Also, we don't know about T.

But we can use it? However, we have to avoid R, C, N, which we do.

But it repeats T. It might be better to avoid repeated letters to get more information.

So non-repeated letters are better.

Back to ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. 
- A is at position 2 (which we haven't tested)
- Tests P, U, S (all new)
- Ends with E.

Similarly, ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> A at 2, tests S, U, T.

Both are good.

I think I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it has T which is a very common consonant.

So second guess: ""SAUTE""

We'll see if A is at position 2 or not, and also test S, U, T.

If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'.

But note: we already know A is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, if we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's at position 2. If not, then A must be at position 1 or 4 (since 5 is E and 3 we already tried).

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- End with E (to utilize the known position).
- Include A in a position that hasn't been tested yet (positions 1, 2, or 4, since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, U) to gather more information.

I chose ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (position 5).
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, U, and T.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether S, U, or T are in the word.

We have two guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for A at position 3).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: saute -> Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is again in position 5 (confirmed).
- A is still present (since we get '-'), but now we know it's not at position 2 (since we placed A at position 2 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- S, U, T are not in the word.

So, combining information:
- E is at position 5.
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3. Since the word is 5 letters and position 5 is occupied by E, A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We must avoid using these absent letters in future guesses.

We have 3 more known constraints:
1. A is at either position 1 or 4.
2. The set of absent letters: {C, R, N, S, U, T}. So we can use the remaining alphabet minus these.
3. The word contains A (exactly once? We don't know for sure, but with the feedback we have, it's possible there's only one A. But we should consider duplicates if needed.)

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the absent ones we know: C, R, N, S, U, T. That leaves: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is already at position 5, and A is already known to be in the word. We might want to focus on finding the other letters and the position of A.

Since we have two possible positions for A (1 or 4), and we know E is at 5, let's denote the pattern:

Position 1: could be A or something else (if A is at 4, then position 1 is another letter)
Position 4: could be A or something else (if A is at 1, then position 4 is another letter)
Position 5: is E

Positions 2 and 3: unknown letters, but they cannot be the absent ones.

Strategy for third guess: We need to determine where A is and what the other letters are.

Option 1: Assume A is at position 1 and choose a word that starts with A and has new letters.
Option 2: Assume A is at position 4 and choose a word with A at position 4.
But we don't know which, so perhaps a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can test position 1 and position 4 separately because we can guess a word that has A in position 4, for example, and see if it gets a '✓' for A (if correct) or a '-' (if misplaced again), but A would be misplaced only if it's not at 4, which would mean it must be at 1.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 4 to test that hypothesis.

But we could also choose a word that doesn't have A at position 1 or 4? No, because we know A must be at 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of these positions.

So let's say we put A at position 4 in our next guess. Then:
- If A is actually at position 4, we get a '✓' for A.
- If A turns out not to be at position 4, then we get a '-' meaning it's misplaced, but since the word must have A at position 1, then we get '-' for A at position 4? But then we would know that A must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we put A at position 1:
- If correct, '✓'
- If not, then A must be at position 4.

So even if we test the opposite, we get the information.

But note: we are going to know immediately: if we put A at position 4 and get '✓', then solved for A and position 4. If we get '-', then A must be at position 1. Similarly, if we put at position 1 and get '✓', it's solved; if '-', then A at position 4.

But in case we get '-', we don't lose a chance because we can adjust next time.

But we also want to test other new letters.

So for efficiency, we can choose a word that tests A at one of the positions and also tests other potential letters.

Let's list possible words that:
- End with E (since E is fixed at position 5)
- Have A at position 4 (to test that slot) or position 1 (to test the other).
- Use new letters from the available set (since absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T).
- Avoid using letters we know are absent.

I'll try for A at position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E

Using available letters: without C,R,N,S,U,T. Common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" : B,L,A,D,E -> but A is at position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3 is A, but we want A at position 4? No, B-L-A-D-E: A at 3.

We need A at position 4.

Examples with A at position 4:
- ""PLATE"" : P,L,A,T,E but T is absent (from second guess, T is x), so cannot use T.

T is absent.

- ""GLADE"" : G,L,A,D,E -> G-L-A-D-E: A at position 3? Position 1: G, 2: L, 3: A, 4: D, 5: E? No, A is at 3.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E (position 5 is E).

So word ends with ""AE"".

But ""AE"" together is not common. Common words ending with ""AE""?

Actually, words like ""olgae"" — no, not a word.

More common: words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Well, for example, ""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:G? No: I-M-A-G-E: letter4 is G, not A? Position 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E. So A is at 3.

Similarly, ""PLACE"" has A at 3.

This is tricky. Let me think.

What about ""PEACE""? P-E-A-C-E, but C is absent. And A at position 3.

Perhaps consider: ""MANGA""? No, ends with A, not E.

I need to reframe.

We can have words where A is at position 4:

""HOUSE"" has E at end, but no A. 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E -> A at position 2? Pattern: 1:G, 2:A, 3:F, 4:F, 5:E — A at 2.

""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E, but U is absent.

""WAIVE"": W-A-I-V-E, A at 2.

""GRAVE"": G-R-A-V-E, R absent.

This is difficult. Maybe there aren't many common English words ending with AE except maybe proper nouns, but we need English words.

Alternative: try A at position 1.

Pattern: A _ _ _ E

With A at 1 and E at 5.

And avoid absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T.

Common words: 
- ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> avoids absent letters? B, I, D available. Checks: B not absent? Yes, B is new. I, D also new.
- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> L, I, K available.
- ""ABODE"": A-B-O-D-E -> available.
- ""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E -> but has two A's? Also, G, P available.
- ""ALONE"": A-L-O-N-E -> but N is absent? Second guess: saute had N not mentioned? No, we have guess 1: ""crane"" gave N(x), so N is absent. Therefore, cannot use ""ALONE"".

Similarly, ""ABASE"": A-B-A-S-E -> S is absent (from guess 2, S(x)), so cannot use.

So options:
- ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- ""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E
- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E — has repeated A? And we don't know if the secret word has another A, but to be safe, perhaps avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Since we are testing A at position 1, repeated A might confuse? But if we put A at 1 and there is another A, we might get feedback.

But for simplicity, let's choose a word with unique letters if possible.

""ABIDE"" — letters: A, B, I, D, E — all unique.

""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — unique.

""ALIKE"" — A, L, I, K, E — unique.

Also, we can test new vowels or consonants.

If we choose ""ALIKE"", it tests L, I, K.

If we choose ""ABIDE"", tests B, I, D.

Both are good.

But note: since E is fixed at end, and if we put A at 1, we can see if it gives us a correct for A at 1.

Similarly, we can find out if A is at 1 or 4 based on the feedback.

So I'll go with ""ALIKE"" because it uses L and K, which are common.

After thinking, I found a word with A at position 4: ""HOMAGE"" — H-O-M-A-G-E? Positions: H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, A at 4, G at 5? But we need E at position 5, so ""HOMAGE"" is H-O-M-A-G-E? No: it's spelled H-O-M-A-G-E? Wait, standard spelling is H-O-M-A-G-E, which is 6 letters? No: H-O-M-A-G-E has H(1),O(2),M(3),A(4),G(5),E(6)? Oh, it's 6 letters. I forgot.

5-letter word with A at position 4 and E at 5: ""GUAVA"" — G-U-A-V-A, no E.

I think it's rare. Common ones: ""FUZEE""? Not really.

""FALSE"" has S and E, but S is absent.

So perhaps it's better to test A at position 1.

Maybe we don't have to put E at the end? We know E is at position 5, so we should use that fixed information. Otherwise, we waste known position.

So we must have the fifth letter as E.

So pattern: for testing A at position 4: must be ? ? ? A E

Words: 
- ""OPALE""? Not a common word.
- ""ETHANE"" is 6 letters.
- ""MORALE"" is 6 letters.

Actually, in Scrabble and Wordle-style games, ""DID_"", ""LIDAE"", etc. I think there are very few.

But let me recall: ""PAUSE"" we used, but that had A at 2.

""CAUSE"" has C absent.

""LEASE"" has S absent.

""BEADY"" ends with Y.

Another one: ""BLUEE"" is not a word.

So perhaps the only common word is not available? I think for practical purposes, we might have to test A at position 1.

So I'll go with that.

Third guess: pattern A ? ? ? E

With A at 1, E at 5.

And avoid C,R,N,S,U,T.

Choose a word with new common letters: B, L, I, etc.

Choose ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E.

Rationale:
- Sets A at position 1: if it gets ✓, we know A is correct at 1. If not (gets '-'), then A must be at position 4.
- Also tests L at position 2, I at position 3, K at position 4.
- Since position 4 in this guess is K, but if A is at position 4, this K will be wrong, but we'll get that information.

If the secret word has A at position 1, then:
- Position 1: ✓ for A.
- Position 5: ✓ for E.

Then we'll see about L, I, K.

If the secret word has A at position 4, then our guess ""ALIKE"" will have:
- Position 1: A with feedback '-' (since A is elsewhere)
- But position 4: K, which if secret has something else, could be wrong.

And since A would be at position 4, we'll get information.

This guess will clearly tell us the position of A.

Moreover, it uses L, I, K which are common.

Therefore, I choose ""ALIKE"" for the third guess.
</think>
From the previous feedback:
- **First Guess (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- **Second Guess (saute)**: E is reconfirmed at position 5 (✓), A is still present but not at position 2 (-), and S, U, T are absent (x).

Key deductions:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- A must be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are invalid for A).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Available letters include A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, etc., with E already placed at position 5.

For the third guess, I chose a word that ends with E, places A at position 1 (to test that hypothesis), and introduces new common letters (L, I, K) for potential positions 2-4. If A is correct at position 1, it will receive ✓; if not, it will receive -, confirming A must be at position 4. This also tests L, I, and K efficiently.

<guess>alike</guess>",alike,"We have two guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for A at position 3).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: saute -> Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is again in position 5 (confirmed).
- A is still present (since we get '-'), but now we know it's not at position 2 (since we placed A at position 2 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- S, U, T are not in the word.

So, combining information:
- E is at position 5.
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3. Since the word is 5 letters and position 5 is occupied by E, A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We must avoid using these absent letters in future guesses.

We have 3 more known constraints:
1. A is at either position 1 or 4.
2. The set of absent letters: {C, R, N, S, U, T}. So we can use the remaining alphabet minus these.
3. The word contains A (exactly once? We don't know for sure, but with the feedback we have, it's possible there's only one A. But we should consider duplicates if needed.)

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the absent ones we know: C, R, N, S, U, T. That leaves: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is already at position 5, and A is already known to be in the word. We might want to focus on finding the other letters and the position of A.

Since we have two possible positions for A (1 or 4), and we know E is at 5, let's denote the pattern:

Position 1: could be A or something else (if A is at 4, then position 1 is another letter)
Position 4: could be A or something else (if A is at 1, then position 4 is another letter)
Position 5: is E

Positions 2 and 3: unknown letters, but they cannot be the absent ones.

Strategy for third guess: We need to determine where A is and what the other letters are.

Option 1: Assume A is at position 1 and choose a word that starts with A and has new letters.
Option 2: Assume A is at position 4 and choose a word with A at position 4.
But we don't know which, so perhaps a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can test position 1 and position 4 separately because we can guess a word that has A in position 4, for example, and see if it gets a '✓' for A (if correct) or a '-' (if misplaced again), but A would be misplaced only if it's not at 4, which would mean it must be at 1.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 4 to test that hypothesis.

But we could also choose a word that doesn't have A at position 1 or 4? No, because we know A must be at 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of these positions.

So let's say we put A at position 4 in our next guess. Then:
- If A is actually at position 4, we get a '✓' for A.
- If A turns out not to be at position 4, then we get a '-' meaning it's misplaced, but since the word must have A at position 1, then we get '-' for A at position 4? But then we would know that A must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we put A at position 1:
- If correct, '✓'
- If not, then A must be at position 4.

So even if we test the opposite, we get the information.

But note: we are going to know immediately: if we put A at position 4 and get '✓', then solved for A and position 4. If we get '-', then A must be at position 1. Similarly, if we put at position 1 and get '✓', it's solved; if '-', then A at position 4.

But in case we get '-', we don't lose a chance because we can adjust next time.

But we also want to test other new letters.

So for efficiency, we can choose a word that tests A at one of the positions and also tests other potential letters.

Let's list possible words that:
- End with E (since E is fixed at position 5)
- Have A at position 4 (to test that slot) or position 1 (to test the other).
- Use new letters from the available set (since absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T).
- Avoid using letters we know are absent.

I'll try for A at position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E

Using available letters: without C,R,N,S,U,T. Common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" : B,L,A,D,E -> but A is at position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3 is A, but we want A at position 4? No, B-L-A-D-E: A at 3.

We need A at position 4.

Examples with A at position 4:
- ""PLATE"" : P,L,A,T,E but T is absent (from second guess, T is x), so cannot use T.

T is absent.

- ""GLADE"" : G,L,A,D,E -> G-L-A-D-E: A at position 3? Position 1: G, 2: L, 3: A, 4: D, 5: E? No, A is at 3.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E (position 5 is E).

So word ends with ""AE"".

But ""AE"" together is not common. Common words ending with ""AE""?

Actually, words like ""olgae"" — no, not a word.

More common: words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Well, for example, ""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:G? No: I-M-A-G-E: letter4 is G, not A? Position 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E. So A is at 3.

Similarly, ""PLACE"" has A at 3.

This is tricky. Let me think.

What about ""PEACE""? P-E-A-C-E, but C is absent. And A at position 3.

Perhaps consider: ""MANGA""? No, ends with A, not E.

I need to reframe.

We can have words where A is at position 4:

""HOUSE"" has E at end, but no A. 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E -> A at position 2? Pattern: 1:G, 2:A, 3:F, 4:F, 5:E — A at 2.

""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E, but U is absent.

""WAIVE"": W-A-I-V-E, A at 2.

""GRAVE"": G-R-A-V-E, R absent.

This is difficult. Maybe there aren't many common English words ending with AE except maybe proper nouns, but we need English words.

Alternative: try A at position 1.

Pattern: A _ _ _ E

With A at 1 and E at 5.

And avoid absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T.

Common words: 
- ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> avoids absent letters? B, I, D available. Checks: B not absent? Yes, B is new. I, D also new.
- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> L, I, K available.
- ""ABODE"": A-B-O-D-E -> available.
- ""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E -> but has two A's? Also, G, P available.
- ""ALONE"": A-L-O-N-E -> but N is absent? Second guess: saute had N not mentioned? No, we have guess 1: ""crane"" gave N(x), so N is absent. Therefore, cannot use ""ALONE"".

Similarly, ""ABASE"": A-B-A-S-E -> S is absent (from guess 2, S(x)), so cannot use.

So options:
- ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- ""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E
- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E — has repeated A? And we don't know if the secret word has another A, but to be safe, perhaps avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Since we are testing A at position 1, repeated A might confuse? But if we put A at 1 and there is another A, we might get feedback.

But for simplicity, let's choose a word with unique letters if possible.

""ABIDE"" — letters: A, B, I, D, E — all unique.

""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — unique.

""ALIKE"" — A, L, I, K, E — unique.

Also, we can test new vowels or consonants.

If we choose ""ALIKE"", it tests L, I, K.

If we choose ""ABIDE"", tests B, I, D.

Both are good.

But note: since E is fixed at end, and if we put A at 1, we can see if it gives us a correct for A at 1.

Similarly, we can find out if A is at 1 or 4 based on the feedback.

So I'll go with ""ALIKE"" because it uses L and K, which are common.

After thinking, I found a word with A at position 4: ""HOMAGE"" — H-O-M-A-G-E? Positions: H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, A at 4, G at 5? But we need E at position 5, so ""HOMAGE"" is H-O-M-A-G-E? No: it's spelled H-O-M-A-G-E? Wait, standard spelling is H-O-M-A-G-E, which is 6 letters? No: H-O-M-A-G-E has H(1),O(2),M(3),A(4),G(5),E(6)? Oh, it's 6 letters. I forgot.

5-letter word with A at position 4 and E at 5: ""GUAVA"" — G-U-A-V-A, no E.

I think it's rare. Common ones: ""FUZEE""? Not really.

""FALSE"" has S and E, but S is absent.

So perhaps it's better to test A at position 1.

Maybe we don't have to put E at the end? We know E is at position 5, so we should use that fixed information. Otherwise, we waste known position.

So we must have the fifth letter as E.

So pattern: for testing A at position 4: must be ? ? ? A E

Words: 
- ""OPALE""? Not a common word.
- ""ETHANE"" is 6 letters.
- ""MORALE"" is 6 letters.

Actually, in Scrabble and Wordle-style games, ""DID_"", ""LIDAE"", etc. I think there are very few.

But let me recall: ""PAUSE"" we used, but that had A at 2.

""CAUSE"" has C absent.

""LEASE"" has S absent.

""BEADY"" ends with Y.

Another one: ""BLUEE"" is not a word.

So perhaps the only common word is not available? I think for practical purposes, we might have to test A at position 1.

So I'll go with that.

Third guess: pattern A ? ? ? E

With A at 1, E at 5.

And avoid C,R,N,S,U,T.

Choose a word with new common letters: B, L, I, etc.

Choose ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E.

Rationale:
- Sets A at position 1: if it gets ✓, we know A is correct at 1. If not (gets '-'), then A must be at position 4.
- Also tests L at position 2, I at position 3, K at position 4.
- Since position 4 in this guess is K, but if A is at position 4, this K will be wrong, but we'll get that information.

If the secret word has A at position 1, then:
- Position 1: ✓ for A.
- Position 5: ✓ for E.

Then we'll see about L, I, K.

If the secret word has A at position 4, then our guess ""ALIKE"" will have:
- Position 1: A with feedback '-' (since A is elsewhere)
- But position 4: K, which if secret has something else, could be wrong.

And since A would be at position 4, we'll get information.

This guess will clearly tell us the position of A.

Moreover, it uses L, I, K which are common.

Therefore, I choose ""ALIKE"" for the third guess.From the previous feedback:
- **First Guess (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- **Second Guess (saute)**: E is reconfirmed at position 5 (✓), A is still present but not at position 2 (-), and S, U, T are absent (x).

 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Ends with E (to confirm or use the known E).
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not 3 (since we know A is in the word, but not at position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Possible positions for A: since it's not at position 3, it could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so A cannot be at 5. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that puts A in a different position (like position 1 or 2) and includes other common letters.

For example:
- We could try ""SAUTE"": 
  - S, A, U, T, E
  - Ends with E, has A at position 2 (which is a new position for A), and uses common letters.

But let's check if it meets the criteria:
- Avoids C, R, N: yes.
- Contains A and E.

Alternatively, we could try ""PLATE"":
- P, L, A, T, E
- Ends with E, has A at position 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3 from the first guess? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it's not correct. So that might not be efficient.

We should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we want A at position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A in positions 1, 2, or 4:

- Position 1: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AGATE"", etc.
- Position 2: ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""HASTE"", etc.
- Position 4: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""SHADE"", etc.

We also want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to find words that have A and also test other vowels or common consonants.

But note: we have only one vowel confirmed (A and E, but E is fixed at the end). We don't know about others.

Let me consider ""SAUTE"":
- S at position 1, A at 2, U at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

This tests:
- S: new letter
- A at position 2 (which we haven't tried before)
- U: new vowel
- T: common consonant

And avoids C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E. But then A is at position 2? Actually, in ""PASTE"", A is at position 2? Let's spell: P-A-S-T-E -> so A is at position 2.

But we have to be cautious: we don't know if A is at position 2 or not. We are testing.

Another option: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E. But we don't know if A is at 1.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, N are absent, so we must avoid them.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good choice because it tests multiple new letters and positions.

But let me check if ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to fry quickly in a little hot fat.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has S, L, A, T, E. However, we know that R is absent, but L is new. But wait, in ""SLATE"", the A is at position 3? S-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3. But we already know A is not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" would be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.

So we need a word that has A not at position 3 and not at the end (since end is E).

Let me think of words with A at position 1: ""ADOBE"", but that has O and B. Or ""AGAPE"", but that has G and P. Or ""ALATE"" (which means having wings) but that might be obscure.

More common: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", but ""AMAZE"" has M and Z, and Z is less common.

""ABUSE"": A at 1, B, U, S, E. This tests A at position 1, and letters B, U, S.

Similarly, ""ALIVE"": A at 1, L, I, V, E. Tests A at 1, and L, I, V.

But we also have the E at the end.

Another word: ""PAUSE"" — P, A, U, S, E. A at position 2? P-A-U-S-E -> A is at position 2.

So ""PAUSE"" has A at position 2.

I think ""PAUSE"" is a good option: it uses common letters and tests A at position 2.

But we have to avoid C, R, N, which we do.

Alternatively, ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E. This has A at position 3? S-H-A-D-E -> A is at position 3. We must avoid that.

So we want A at 1, 2, or 4.

""BLAME"": B, L, A, M, E -> A at position 3? B-L-A-M-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""FLAME"": same, A at 3.

""SHAME"": S-H-A-M-E -> A at 3.

How about ""BEADY""? But that ends with Y, not E.

We need to end with E.

""IMAGE"": I, M, A, G, E -> A at position 3? I-M-A-G-E -> position 3. Avoid.

""OZONE"" has no A.

Let me think of words with A at position 4: 
- ""CAUSE"" but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.
- ""RAISE"" but R is absent.
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> but T is repeated? T-A-S-T-E -> two T's? And A is at position 2? T-A-S-T-E: positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E. So A is at 2.

""TASTE"" has A at position 2 and ends with E. But it has T at position 1 and 4. Also, we don't know about T.

But we can use it? However, we have to avoid R, C, N, which we do.

But it repeats T. It might be better to avoid repeated letters to get more information.

So non-repeated letters are better.

Back to ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. 
- A is at position 2 (which we haven't tested)
- Tests P, U, S (all new)
- Ends with E.

Similarly, ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> A at 2, tests S, U, T.

Both are good.

I think I'll go with ""SAUTE"" because it has T which is a very common consonant.

So second guess: ""SAUTE""

We'll see if A is at position 2 or not, and also test S, U, T.

If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A? Or if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'.

But note: we already know A is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, if we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's at position 2. If not, then A must be at position 1 or 4 (since 5 is E and 3 we already tried).

So it's a good test.

Therefore, I choose ""SAUTE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess, I need to:
- End with E (to utilize the known position).
- Include A in a position that hasn't been tested yet (positions 1, 2, or 4, since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
- Avoid C, R, and N.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, U) to gather more information.

I chose ""saute"" because:
- It ends with E (position 5).
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, U, and T.
- It avoids C, R, and N.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal whether S, U, or T are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-' for A at position 3).
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: saute -> Feedback: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is again in position 5 (confirmed).
- A is still present (since we get '-'), but now we know it's not at position 2 (since we placed A at position 2 and got '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- S, U, T are not in the word.

So, combining information:
- E is at position 5.
- A is in the word, but not at position 2 or 3. Since the word is 5 letters and position 5 is occupied by E, A must be at position 1 or 4.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T.

We must avoid using these absent letters in future guesses.

We have 3 more known constraints:
1. A is at either position 1 or 4.
2. The set of absent letters: {C, R, N, S, U, T}. So we can use the remaining alphabet minus these.
3. The word contains A (exactly once? We don't know for sure, but with the feedback we have, it's possible there's only one A. But we should consider duplicates if needed.)

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the absent ones we know: C, R, N, S, U, T. That leaves: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is already at position 5, and A is already known to be in the word. We might want to focus on finding the other letters and the position of A.

Since we have two possible positions for A (1 or 4), and we know E is at 5, let's denote the pattern:

Position 1: could be A or something else (if A is at 4, then position 1 is another letter)
Position 4: could be A or something else (if A is at 1, then position 4 is another letter)
Position 5: is E

Positions 2 and 3: unknown letters, but they cannot be the absent ones.

Strategy for third guess: We need to determine where A is and what the other letters are.

Option 1: Assume A is at position 1 and choose a word that starts with A and has new letters.
Option 2: Assume A is at position 4 and choose a word with A at position 4.
But we don't know which, so perhaps a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can test position 1 and position 4 separately because we can guess a word that has A in position 4, for example, and see if it gets a '✓' for A (if correct) or a '-' (if misplaced again), but A would be misplaced only if it's not at 4, which would mean it must be at 1.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 4 to test that hypothesis.

But we could also choose a word that doesn't have A at position 1 or 4? No, because we know A must be at 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of these positions.

So let's say we put A at position 4 in our next guess. Then:
- If A is actually at position 4, we get a '✓' for A.
- If A turns out not to be at position 4, then we get a '-' meaning it's misplaced, but since the word must have A at position 1, then we get '-' for A at position 4? But then we would know that A must be at position 1.

Similarly, if we put A at position 1:
- If correct, '✓'
- If not, then A must be at position 4.

So even if we test the opposite, we get the information.

But note: we are going to know immediately: if we put A at position 4 and get '✓', then solved for A and position 4. If we get '-', then A must be at position 1. Similarly, if we put at position 1 and get '✓', it's solved; if '-', then A at position 4.

But in case we get '-', we don't lose a chance because we can adjust next time.

But we also want to test other new letters.

So for efficiency, we can choose a word that tests A at one of the positions and also tests other potential letters.

Let's list possible words that:
- End with E (since E is fixed at position 5)
- Have A at position 4 (to test that slot) or position 1 (to test the other).
- Use new letters from the available set (since absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T).
- Avoid using letters we know are absent.

I'll try for A at position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ A E

Using available letters: without C,R,N,S,U,T. Common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, etc.

Possible words:
- ""BLADE"" : B,L,A,D,E -> but A is at position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3 is A, but we want A at position 4? No, B-L-A-D-E: A at 3.

We need A at position 4.

Examples with A at position 4:
- ""PLATE"" : P,L,A,T,E but T is absent (from second guess, T is x), so cannot use T.

T is absent.

- ""GLADE"" : G,L,A,D,E -> G-L-A-D-E: A at position 3? Position 1: G, 2: L, 3: A, 4: D, 5: E? No, A is at 3.

We need the fourth letter to be A.

So pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E (position 5 is E).

So word ends with ""AE"".

But ""AE"" together is not common. Common words ending with ""AE""?

Actually, words like ""olgae"" — no, not a word.

More common: words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Well, for example, ""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:G? No: I-M-A-G-E: letter4 is G, not A? Position 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E. So A is at 3.

Similarly, ""PLACE"" has A at 3.

This is tricky. Let me think.

What about ""PEACE""? P-E-A-C-E, but C is absent. And A at position 3.

Perhaps consider: ""MANGA""? No, ends with A, not E.

I need to reframe.

We can have words where A is at position 4:

""HOUSE"" has E at end, but no A. 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E -> A at position 2? Pattern: 1:G, 2:A, 3:F, 4:F, 5:E — A at 2.

""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E, but U is absent.

""WAIVE"": W-A-I-V-E, A at 2.

""GRAVE"": G-R-A-V-E, R absent.

This is difficult. Maybe there aren't many common English words ending with AE except maybe proper nouns, but we need English words.

Alternative: try A at position 1.

Pattern: A _ _ _ E

With A at 1 and E at 5.

And avoid absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T.

Common words: 
- ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> avoids absent letters? B, I, D available. Checks: B not absent? Yes, B is new. I, D also new.
- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> L, I, K available.
- ""ABODE"": A-B-O-D-E -> available.
- ""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E -> but has two A's? Also, G, P available.
- ""ALONE"": A-L-O-N-E -> but N is absent? Second guess: saute had N not mentioned? No, we have guess 1: ""crane"" gave N(x), so N is absent. Therefore, cannot use ""ALONE"".

Similarly, ""ABASE"": A-B-A-S-E -> S is absent (from guess 2, S(x)), so cannot use.

So options:
- ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- ""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E
- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E — has repeated A? And we don't know if the secret word has another A, but to be safe, perhaps avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Since we are testing A at position 1, repeated A might confuse? But if we put A at 1 and there is another A, we might get feedback.

But for simplicity, let's choose a word with unique letters if possible.

""ABIDE"" — letters: A, B, I, D, E — all unique.

""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — unique.

""ALIKE"" — A, L, I, K, E — unique.

Also, we can test new vowels or consonants.

If we choose ""ALIKE"", it tests L, I, K.

If we choose ""ABIDE"", tests B, I, D.

Both are good.

But note: since E is fixed at end, and if we put A at 1, we can see if it gives us a correct for A at 1.

Similarly, we can find out if A is at 1 or 4 based on the feedback.

So I'll go with ""ALIKE"" because it uses L and K, which are common.

After thinking, I found a word with A at position 4: ""HOMAGE"" — H-O-M-A-G-E? Positions: H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, A at 4, G at 5? But we need E at position 5, so ""HOMAGE"" is H-O-M-A-G-E? No: it's spelled H-O-M-A-G-E? Wait, standard spelling is H-O-M-A-G-E, which is 6 letters? No: H-O-M-A-G-E has H(1),O(2),M(3),A(4),G(5),E(6)? Oh, it's 6 letters. I forgot.

5-letter word with A at position 4 and E at 5: ""GUAVA"" — G-U-A-V-A, no E.

I think it's rare. Common ones: ""FUZEE""? Not really.

""FALSE"" has S and E, but S is absent.

So perhaps it's better to test A at position 1.

Maybe we don't have to put E at the end? We know E is at position 5, so we should use that fixed information. Otherwise, we waste known position.

So we must have the fifth letter as E.

So pattern: for testing A at position 4: must be ? ? ? A E

Words: 
- ""OPALE""? Not a common word.
- ""ETHANE"" is 6 letters.
- ""MORALE"" is 6 letters.

Actually, in Scrabble and Wordle-style games, ""DID_"", ""LIDAE"", etc. I think there are very few.

But let me recall: ""PAUSE"" we used, but that had A at 2.

""CAUSE"" has C absent.

""LEASE"" has S absent.

""BEADY"" ends with Y.

Another one: ""BLUEE"" is not a word.

So perhaps the only common word is not available? I think for practical purposes, we might have to test A at position 1.

So I'll go with that.

Third guess: pattern A ? ? ? E

With A at 1, E at 5.

And avoid C,R,N,S,U,T.

Choose a word with new common letters: B, L, I, etc.

Choose ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E.

Rationale:
- Sets A at position 1: if it gets ✓, we know A is correct at 1. If not (gets '-'), then A must be at position 4.
- Also tests L at position 2, I at position 3, K at position 4.
- Since position 4 in this guess is K, but if A is at position 4, this K will be wrong, but we'll get that information.

If the secret word has A at position 1, then:
- Position 1: ✓ for A.
- Position 5: ✓ for E.

Then we'll see about L, I, K.

If the secret word has A at position 4, then our guess ""ALIKE"" will have:
- Position 1: A with feedback '-' (since A is elsewhere)
- But position 4: K, which if secret has something else, could be wrong.

And since A would be at position 4, we'll get information.

This guess will clearly tell us the position of A.

Moreover, it uses L, I, K which are common.

Therefore, I choose ""ALIKE"" for the third guess.From the previous feedback:
- **First Guess (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- **Second Guess (saute)**: E is reconfirmed at position 5 (✓), A is still present but not at position 2 (-), and S, U, T are absent (x).

Key deductions:
- E is fixed at position 5.
- A must be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are invalid for A).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.
- Available letters include A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, etc., with E already placed at position 5.

For the third guess, I chose a word that ends with E, places A at position 1 (to test that hypothesis), and introduces new common letters (L, I, K) for potential positions 2-4. If A is correct at position 1, it will receive ✓; if not, it will receive -, confirming A must be at position 4. This also tests L, I, and K efficiently.

But wait, we know A is not at position 3 from the first guess? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and got a \'-\', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So in ""PLATE"", A is at position 3 again? That would be the same position we already tried and know it\'s not correct. So that might not be efficient.\n\nWe should avoid putting A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. So we want A at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me list some words ending with E and containing A in positions 1, 2, or 4:\n\n- Position 1: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AGATE"", etc.\n- Position 2: ""SAUTE"", ""PASTE"", ""HASTE"", etc.\n- Position 4: ""BLAME"", ""FLAME"", ""SHADE"", etc.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know E is at the end, we can try to find words that have A and also test other vowels or common consonants.\n\nBut note: we have only one vowel confirmed (A and E, but E is fixed at the end).

We are testing.\n\nAnother option: ""ALIKE"": A at 1, L, I, K, E. But we don\'t know if A is at 1.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, N are absent, so we must avoid them.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a good choice because it tests multiple new letters and positions.\n\nBut let me check if ""SAUTE"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to fry quickly in a little hot fat.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has S, L, A, T, E. However, we know that R is absent, but L is new. But wait, in ""SLATE"", the A is at position 3? S-L-A-T-E -> A is at position 3. But we already know A is not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.\n\nTherefore, ""SLATE"" would be inefficient because we already know A is not at position 3.\n\nSo we need a word that has A not at position 3 and not at the end (since end is E).\n\nLet me think of words with A at position 1: ""ADOBE"", but that has O and B. Or ""AGAPE"", but that has G and P. Or ""ALATE"" (which means having wings) but that might be obscure.\n\nMore common: ""ABUSE"", ""ALIVE"", ""AMAZE"", but ""AMAZE"" has M and Z, and Z is less common.\n\n""ABUSE"": A at 1, B, U, S, E.

T-A-S-T-E -> two T\'s? And A is at position 2? T-A-S-T-E: positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E. So A is at 2.\n\n""TASTE"" has A at position 2 and ends with E. But it has T at position 1 and 4. Also, we don\'t know about T.\n\nBut we can use it? However, we have to avoid R, C, N, which we do.\n\nBut it repeats T. It might be better to avoid repeated letters to get more information.\n\nSo non-repeated letters are better.\n\nBack to ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E -> positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. \n- A is at position 2 (which we haven\'t tested)\n- Tests P, U, S (all new)\n- Ends with E.\n\nSimilarly, ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> 1:S, 2:A, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> A at 2, tests S, U, T.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SAUTE"" because it has T which is a very common consonant.\n\nSo second guess: ""SAUTE""\n\nWe\'ll see if A is at position 2 or not, and also test S, U, T.\n\nIf A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A? Or if it\'s elsewhere, we get a \'-\'.\n\nBut note: we already know A is in the word, so we are testing the position.\n\nAlso, if we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s at position 2.

We might want to focus on finding the other letters and the position of A.\n\nSince we have two possible positions for A (1 or 4), and we know E is at 5, let\'s denote the pattern:\n\nPosition 1: could be A or something else (if A is at 4, then position 1 is another letter)\nPosition 4: could be A or something else (if A is at 1, then position 4 is another letter)\nPosition 5: is E\n\nPositions 2 and 3: unknown letters, but they cannot be the absent ones.\n\nStrategy for third guess: We need to determine where A is and what the other letters are.\n\nOption 1: Assume A is at position 1 and choose a word that starts with A and has new letters.\nOption 2: Assume A is at position 4 and choose a word with A at position 4.\nBut we don\'t know which, so perhaps a word that tests both possibilities? Actually, we can test position 1 and position 4 separately because we can guess a word that has A in position 4, for example, and see if it gets a \'✓\' for A (if correct) or a \'-\' (if misplaced again), but A would be misplaced only if it\'s not at 4, which would mean it must be at 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 4 to test that hypothesis.\n\nBut we could also choose a word that doesn\'t have A at position 1 or 4? No, because we know A must be at 1 or 4, so we have to include A in one of these positions.\n\nSo let\'s say we put A at position 4 in our next guess. Then:\n- If A is actually at position 4, we get a \'✓\' for A.\n- If A turns out not to be at position 4, then we get a \'-\' meaning it\'s misplaced, but since the word must have A at position 1, then we get \'-\' for A at position 4? But then we would know that A must be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A at position 1:\n- If correct, \'✓\'\n- If not, then A must be at position 4.\n\nSo even if we test the opposite, we get the information.\n\nBut note: we are going to know immediately: if we put A at position 4 and get \'✓\', then solved for A and position 4. If we get \'-\', then A must be at position 1. Similarly, if we put at position 1 and get \'✓\', it\'s solved; if \'-\', then A at position 4.\n\nBut in case we get \'-\', we don\'t lose a chance because we can adjust next time.\n\nBut we also want to test other new letters.\n\nSo for efficiency, we can choose a word that tests A at one of the positions and also tests other potential letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that:\n- End with E (since E is fixed at position 5)\n- Have A at position 4 (to test that slot) or position 1 (to test the other).\n- Use new letters from the available set (since absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T).\n- Avoid using letters we know are absent.\n\nI\'ll try for A at position 4.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ A E\n\nUsing available letters: without C,R,N,S,U,T. Common letters: L, I, O, P, M, B, D, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLADE"" : B,L,A,D,E -> but A is at position 3? B-L-A-D-E -> position 3 is A, but we want A at position 4? No, B-L-A-D-E: A at 3.\n\nWe need A at position 4.\n\nExamples with A at position 4:\n- ""PLATE"" : P,L,A,T,E but T is absent (from second guess, T is x), so cannot use T.\n\nT is absent.\n\n- ""GLADE"" : G,L,A,D,E -> G-L-A-D-E: A at position 3? Position 1: G, 2: L, 3: A, 4: D, 5: E? No, A is at 3.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be A.\n\nSo pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, A, E (position 5 is E).\n\nSo word ends with ""AE"".\n\nBut ""AE"" together is not common. Common words ending with ""AE""?\n\nActually, words like ""olgae"" — no, not a word.\n\nMore common: words with A at position 4 and E at 5? Well, for example, ""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:G? No: I-M-A-G-E: letter4 is G, not A? Position 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E. So A is at 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLACE"" has A at 3.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think.\n\nWhat about ""PEACE""? P-E-A-C-E, but C is absent. And A at position 3.\n\nPerhaps consider: ""MANGA""? No, ends with A, not E.\n\nI need to reframe.\n\nWe can have words where A is at position 4:\n\n""HOUSE"" has E at end, but no A. \n\n""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E -> A at position 2? Pattern: 1:G, 2:A, 3:F, 4:F, 5:E — A at 2.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E, but U is absent.\n\n""WAIVE"": W-A-I-V-E, A at 2.\n\n""GRAVE"": G-R-A-V-E, R absent.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe there aren\'t many common English words ending with AE except maybe proper nouns, but we need English words.\n\nAlternative: try A at position 1.\n\nPattern: A _ _ _ E\n\nWith A at 1 and E at 5.\n\nAnd avoid absent letters: C,R,N,S,U,T.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ABIDE"": A-B-I-D-E -> avoids absent letters? B, I, D available. Checks: B not absent? Yes, B is new. I, D also new.\n- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> L, I, K available.\n- ""ABODE"": A-B-O-D-E -> available.\n- ""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E -> but has two A\'s? Also, G, P available.\n- ""ALONE"": A-L-O-N-E -> but N is absent? Second guess: saute had N not mentioned? No, we have guess 1: ""crane"" gave N(x), so N is absent. Therefore, cannot use ""ALONE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""ABASE"": A-B-A-S-E -> S is absent (from guess 2, S(x)), so cannot use.\n\nSo options:\n- ""ABIDE"": A, B, I, D, E\n- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E\n- ""ABODE"": A, B, O, D, E\n- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E — has repeated A? And we don\'t know if the secret word has another A, but to be safe, perhaps avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nSince we are testing A at position 1, repeated A might confuse? But if we put A at 1 and there is another A, we might get feedback.\n\nBut for simplicity, let\'s choose a word with unique letters if possible.\n\n""ABIDE"" — letters: A, B, I, D, E — all unique.\n\n""ABODE"" — A, B, O, D, E — unique.\n\n""ALIKE"" — A, L, I, K, E — unique.\n\nAlso, we can test new vowels or consonants.\n\nIf we choose ""ALIKE"", it tests L, I, K.\n\nIf we choose ""ABIDE"", tests B, I, D.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut note: since E is fixed at end, and if we put A at 1, we can see if it gives us a correct for A at 1.\n\nSimilarly, we can find out if A is at 1 or 4 based on the feedback.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALIKE"" because it uses L and K, which are common.\n\nAfter thinking, I found a word with A at position 4: ""HOMAGE"" — H-O-M-A-G-E? Positions: H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, A at 4, G at 5? But we need E at position 5, so ""HOMAGE"" is H-O-M-A-G-E? No: it\'s spelled H-O-M-A-G-E? Wait, standard spelling is H-O-M-A-G-E, which is 6 letters? No: H-O-M-A-G-E has H(1),O(2),M(3),A(4),G(5),E(6)? Oh, it\'s 6 letters. I forgot.\n\n5-letter word with A at position 4 and E at 5: ""GUAVA"" — G-U-A-V-A, no E.\n\nI think it\'s rare. Common ones: ""FUZEE""? Not really.\n\n""FALSE"" has S and E, but S is absent.\n\nSo perhaps it\'s better to test A at position 1.\n\nMaybe we don\'t have to put E at the end? We know E is at position 5, so we should use that fixed information. Otherwise, we waste known position.\n\nSo we must have the fifth letter as E.\n\nSo pattern: for testing A at position 4: must be ? ? ? A E\n\nWords: \n- ""OPALE""? Not a common word.\n- ""ETHANE"" is 6 letters.\n- ""MORALE"" is 6 letters.\n\nActually, in Scrabble and Wordle-style games, ""DID_"", ""LIDAE"", etc. I think there are very few.\n\nBut let me recall: ""PAUSE"" we used, but that had A at 2.\n\n""CAUSE"" has C absent.\n\n""LEASE"" has S absent.\n\n""BEADY"" ends with Y.\n\nAnother one: ""BLUEE"" is not a word.\n\nSo perhaps the only common word is not available? I think for practical purposes, we might have to test A at position 1.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nThird guess: pattern A ? ? ? E\n\nWith A at 1, E at 5.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,N,S,U,T.\n\nChoose a word with new common letters: B, L, I, etc.\n\nChoose ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E.\n\nRationale:\n- Sets A at position 1: if it gets ✓, we know A is correct at 1. If not (gets \'-\'), then A must be at position 4.\n- Also tests L at position 2, I at position 3, K at position 4.\n- Since position 4 in this guess is K, but if A is at position 4, this K will be wrong, but we\'ll get that information.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 1, then:\n- Position 1: ✓ for A.\n- Position 5: ✓ for E.\n\nThen we\'ll see about L, I, K.\n\nIf the secret word has A at position 4, then our guess ""ALIKE"" will have:\n- Position 1: A with feedback \'-\' (since A is elsewhere)\n- But position 4: K, which if secret has something else, could be wrong.\n\nAnd since A would be at position 4, we\'ll get information.\n\nThis guess will clearly tell us the position of A.\n\nMoreover, it uses L, I, K which are common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ALIKE"" for the third guess.From the previous feedback:\n- **First Guess (crane)**: E is confirmed at position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not at position 3 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).\n- **Second Guess (saute)**: E is reconfirmed at position 5 (✓), A is still present but not at position 2 (-), and S, U, T are absent (x).\n\nKey deductions:\n- E is fixed at position 5.\n- A must be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are invalid for A).\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, N, S, U, T.\n- Available letters include A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, etc., with E already placed at position 5.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose a word that ends with E, places A at position 1 (to test that hypothesis), and introduces new common letters (L, I, K) for potential positions 2-4. If A is correct at position 1, it will receive ✓; if not, it will receive -, confirming A must be at position 4. This also tests L, I, and K efficiently.\n\n<guess>alike</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: saute -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: alike -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for Guess 3: ""alike"" -> A(✓) L(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- A is correct at position 1 (so secret word starts with A).
- E is correct at position 5 (as before).
- L, I, K are not in the word at all.

Combining with previous feedback:
From Guess 1: C, R, N are absent.
From Guess 2: S, U, T are absent.
From Guess 3: L, I, K are absent.

So total absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, L, I, K.

We know:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Positions 2,3,4: need to be filled with letters not in the absent set.

Remaining letters available: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z; and possibly duplicates? But we haven't seen any duplicate clues so far, so maybe assume no duplicates for now.

Since we have two letters fixed (A and E) and only positions 2,3,4 to find, with many absent letters.

We need a word of the form: A ? ? ? E

Where the middle three letters are from the available pool and not the absent letters.

Possible words: Let's list common ones.

For example:
- ""APPLE"" but P is available? Wait, ""APPLE"" has L and E? L is absent (from guess 3), so L cannot be used. So ""APPLE"" is invalid.

Potential words:
- ""ABBEY"" - ends with Y, not E? No, must end with E.
- ""ABASE"" - has S (absent) and E at end? A-B-A-S-E, but S is absent, also two A's? But we don't know for sure.
- ""ABATE"" - T and A? T absent.
- ""ADOBE"" - D, O, B, E -> letters: A, D, O, B, E. All available? Check: D, O, B not absent. Yes.
  - Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E -> ""adobe""

Another: ""AWAKE"" - W, A, K? But K is absent (from guess 3), and also two A's? Not good.

""AGAPE"" - G, A, P, E -> but A repeated? And we have positions: A at 1 and then A at 3? But G is available? ""A-G-A-P-E"" -> A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). But we have absent I,K,L, etc., but G and P are available.

However, we also need to check if A could be at other positions? But in the secret word, we know position 1 is A, so A at 3 might be possible? But we don't have any info saying A is duplicated. But we should consider.

From past feedback, guess 1 had A at position 3 giving '-' meaning A was in the word but not position 3. Now we have position 1 fixed as A, so if there were a second A, it might have been detected? But guess 3 had only one A and we put it at 1 and got ✓, so no feedback about other positions. We don't know.

But guess 2 had A at position 2 and got '-' meaning it was elsewhere, but now we've fixed position 1, so if there is a duplicate A, it is possible at position 4? Because position 2 and 3 were tested? Let me check:

In guess 2, A was at position 2 and got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 2. Then in guess 3, we put A at position 1 and got ✓, so that A (position 1) is where the A is. For there to be another A, it must be at position 4 (position 3 and 2 are already tested and not having A, position 5 is E). But we haven't tested position 4 for A? But we don't know.

But since we got '-' for A at position 2 in guess 2, and ✓ for A at position 1 in guess 3, it doesn't preclude another A. However, in guess 1, A was at position 3 and gave '-', so the A was not at 3. So if there is a second A, it could only be at position 4? But we don't know if there is a second A.

For efficiency, perhaps assume no duplicate for now and use a word with distinct letters.

So back to available words: ""adobe"" - A, D, O, B, E.

Letters: D, O, B are not absent. Also, O is a vowel we haven't tested.

Another common word: ""AGONE"" - A-G-O-N-E, but N is absent.

""AMAZE"" - has Z and M? M is available? ""A-M-A-Z-E""? Position 1:A, 2:M, 3:A, 4:Z, 5:E. But Z is less common, and A repeated? And we don't know.

Another one: ""APPLE"" invalid due to L.

""ABODE"" - A-B-O-D-E -> letters B,O,D,E. All available? B, O, D not in absent set? Yes. And positions: 1:A,2:B,3:O,4:D,5:E.

Similar to ""adobe"" but B and D swapped? ""ADOBE"" is A,D,O,B,E. ""ABODE"" is A,B,O,D,E.

Both are valid words.

Also: ""APACE"" - A-P-A-C-E? C is absent. Invalid.

""AFIRE"" - F, I, R? I and R absent. Invalid.

""AGLOW"" ends with W, not E.

""AMUSE"" - M,U,S,E? U and S absent.

""AMPLE"" - M,P,L,E? L absent.

""ANIME"" - N,I absent? N and I both absent? N from guess 1, I from guess 3. Invalid.

""AREAS"" not E ending.

""ASHED"" S absent.

So likely candidates: ""adobe"" or ""abode"".

Another possibility: ""ABIDE"" but I absent.

""ALIVE"" L and I absent.

""AMBLE"" M,B,L,E? L absent.

""ANODE"" N absent.

""ARGUE"" R absent.

""ARISE"" R and S absent.

""AVOID"" ends with D.

""AXIOM"" no E.

""AZOLE"" Z might be too rare? But valid scrabble word? But let's avoid rare words.

""ADORE"" R absent.

So we have ""adobe"" and ""abode"".

We can choose either.

But which one to test?

Perhaps both are similar? ""Adobe"" and ""abode"" share similar letters except order.

We need to decide.

Since neither has been part of feedback, we can pick one.

Perhaps ""ADOBE"": if D is at position 2 and O at 3 and B at 4.

Or ""ABODE"": B at 2, O at 3, D at 4.

Let me think of common letters.

Or we can pick one that tests more vowels? O is common.

But since both have O, it's the same.

I'll go with ""ADOBE"".

So fourth guess: ""ADOBE""

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback for D,O,B.

But we might get it wrong, then we have one candidate left: ""abode"".

We only have two possible common words, but maybe others? I listed earlier and found only these two for now.

But let me check others:

""AFORE"" but O, and F? ""A-F-O-R-E""? R is absent.

""AGAVE"" G,A,V,E? But two A? A-G-A-V-E? V available? ""agave"" is a plant, valid. But positions: A at 1, G at 2, A at 3, V at 4, E at 5. Now, we haven't tested A at position 3? No, because guess 1 had A at position 3 and got '-' meaning A not at position 3? So if ""agave"" were the word, guess 1: A at position 3 for ""CRANE"" was A but '-'? But in ""agave"", A is at position 3? So it should have been correct? But feedback was '-' for A at position 3, meaning it was misplaced, not correct? But if secret word is ""AGAVE"", then position 3 is A, so guess 1 ""CRANE"" had A at position 3, which matches secret position 3? So it should have been '✓' for A? But we got '-' , which means A is elsewhere? Contradiction.

So secret cannot be ""AGAVE"" because in guess 1, A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, any word with A at position 3 is impossible.

Therefore, ""agave"" is invalid as it has A at position 3.

Similarly, earlier we had position 1 now fixed as A, so only position 4 for a second A.

But let's assume no duplicate for simplicity until forced.

So back to ""adobe"" and ""abode"".

Perhaps ""ADIEU"" but E not at end? And I absent? Not possible.

""ADZES"" no E.

So I think ""adobe"" is a good guess.

If not, next we can try ""abode"".

Thus, I choose ""adobe"".After analyzing the feedback:
- The word starts with A and ends with E (from ✓ on A and E in Guess 3).
- Absent letters include C, R, N, S, U, T (from Guess 1-2) and L, I, K (from Guess 3), leaving possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given the pattern A ? ? ? E, the middle letters must not use any absent letter.

Common English words matching this pattern:  
- ""ADOBE"" (D at pos 2, O at pos 3, B at pos 4)  
- ""ABODE"" (B at pos 2, O at pos 3, D at pos 4)  

Both words use available letters and avoid duplicates. Testing ""ADOBE"" will quickly narrow the possibilities based on feedback for D, O, B. If incorrect, ""ABODE"" can be tried next.

Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Confirmed E at position 5 (✓), A present but not at position 3 (-), and C/R/N absent (x).
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: Confirmed E at position 5 (✓), A present but not at position 2 (-), and S/U/T absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (alike)**: Confirmed A at position 1 (✓) and E at position 5 (✓), with L/I/K absent (x).

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **A** (pos 1) and ends with **E** (pos 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, L, I, K (confirmed not in the word).
- Positions 2–4 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z. No duplicates are indicated, so we prioritize words with distinct letters.
- Common words fitting ""A _ _ _ E"" pattern:
  - ""ADOBE"" (letters: D, O, B)
  - ""ABODE"" (letters: B, O, D)
- Both are valid 5-letter English words and avoid absent letters. Testing ""ADOBE"" first (to prioritize D over B at position 2) will clarify positions for D, O, B based on feedback. If incorrect, ""ABODE"" is the backup candidate.

<guess>adobe</guess>",adobe,"We have feedback for Guess 3: ""alike"" -> A(✓) L(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- A is correct at position 1 (so secret word starts with A).
- E is correct at position 5 (as before).
- L, I, K are not in the word at all.

Combining with previous feedback:
From Guess 1: C, R, N are absent.
From Guess 2: S, U, T are absent.
From Guess 3: L, I, K are absent.

So total absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, L, I, K.

We know:
- Position 1: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Positions 2,3,4: need to be filled with letters not in the absent set.

Remaining letters available: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z; and possibly duplicates? But we haven't seen any duplicate clues so far, so maybe assume no duplicates for now.

- ""ABATE"" - T and A? T absent.
- ""ADOBE"" - D, O, B, E -> letters: A, D, O, B, E. All available? Check: D, O, B not absent. Yes.
  - Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:O, 4:B, 5:E -> ""adobe""

Another: ""AWAKE"" - W, A, K? But K is absent (from guess 3), and also two A's? Not good.

""AGAPE"" - G, A, P, E -> but A repeated? And we have positions: A at 1 and then A at 3? But G is available? ""A-G-A-P-E"" -> A(1), G(2), A(3), P(4), E(5). But we have absent I,K,L, etc., but G and P are available.

Another one: ""APPLE"" invalid due to L.

Similar to ""adobe"" but B and D swapped? ""ADOBE"" is A,D,O,B,E. ""ABODE"" is A,B,O,D,E.

""AMBLE"" M,B,L,E? L absent.

""ANODE"" N absent.

""ARGUE"" R absent.

""ARISE"" R and S absent.

""AVOID"" ends with D.

""AXIOM"" no E.

""AZOLE"" Z might be too rare? But valid scrabble word? But let's avoid rare words.

""ADORE"" R absent.

So we have ""adobe"" and ""abode"".

We can choose either.

But which one to test?

Perhaps both are similar? ""Adobe"" and ""abode"" share similar letters except order.

We need to decide.

Since neither has been part of feedback, we can pick one.

Perhaps ""ADOBE"": if D is at position 2 and O at 3 and B at 4.

Or ""ABODE"": B at 2, O at 3, D at 4.

Let me think of common letters.

Or we can pick one that tests more vowels? O is common.

But since both have O, it's the same.

I'll go with ""ADOBE"".

So fourth guess: ""ADOBE""

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback for D,O,B.

But we might get it wrong, then we have one candidate left: ""abode"".

We only have two possible common words, but maybe others? I listed earlier and found only these two for now.

But let me check others:

""AFORE"" but O, and F? ""A-F-O-R-E""? R is absent.

""AGAVE"" G,A,V,E? But two A? A-G-A-V-E? V available? ""agave"" is a plant, valid. But positions: A at 1, G at 2, A at 3, V at 4, E at 5. Now, we haven't tested A at position 3? No, because guess 1 had A at position 3 and got '-' meaning A not at position 3? So if ""agave"" were the word, guess 1: A at position 3 for ""CRANE"" was A but '-'? But in ""agave"", A is at position 3? So it should have been correct? But feedback was '-' for A at position 3, meaning it was misplaced, not correct? But if secret word is ""AGAVE"", then position 3 is A, so guess 1 ""CRANE"" had A at position 3, which matches secret position 3? So it should have been '✓' for A? But we got '-' , which means A is elsewhere? Contradiction.

So secret cannot be ""AGAVE"" because in guess 1, A was at position 3 and got '-', meaning A is not at position 3 in the secret word.

Similarly, any word with A at position 3 is impossible.

Therefore, ""agave"" is invalid as it has A at position 3.

Similarly, earlier we had position 1 now fixed as A, so only position 4 for a second A.

But let's assume no duplicate for simplicity until forced.

So back to ""adobe"" and ""abode"".

Perhaps ""ADIEU"" but E not at end? And I absent? Not possible.

""ADZES"" no E.

So I think ""adobe"" is a good guess.

If not, next we can try ""abode"".

Thus, I choose ""adobe"".After analyzing the feedback:
- The word starts with A and ends with E (from ✓ on A and E in Guess 3).
- Absent letters include C, R, N, S, U, T (from Guess 1-2) and L, I, K (from Guess 3), leaving possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given the pattern A ? ? ? E, the middle letters must not use any absent letter.

Common English words matching this pattern:  
- ""ADOBE"" (D at pos 2, O at pos 3, B at pos 4)  
- ""ABODE"" (B at pos 2, O at pos 3, D at pos 4)  

Both words use available letters and avoid duplicates. Testing ""ADOBE"" will quickly narrow the possibilities based on feedback for D, O, B. If incorrect, ""ABODE"" can be tried next.

<guess>adobe</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Confirmed E at position 5 (✓), A present but not at position 3 (-), and C/R/N absent (x).
- **Guess 2 (saute)**: Confirmed E at position 5 (✓), A present but not at position 2 (-), and S/U/T absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (alike)**: Confirmed A at position 1 (✓) and E at position 5 (✓), with L/I/K absent (x).

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **A** (pos 1) and ends with **E** (pos 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, U, T, L, I, K (confirmed not in the word).
- Positions 2–4 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, M, O, P, V, W, X, Y, Z. No duplicates are indicated, so we prioritize words with distinct letters.
- Common words fitting ""A _ _ _ E"" pattern:
  - ""ADOBE"" (letters: D, O, B)
  - ""ABODE"" (letters: B, O, D)
- Both are valid 5-letter English words and avoid absent letters. Testing ""ADOBE"" first (to prioritize D over B at position 2) will clarify positions for D, O, B based on feedback. If incorrect, ""ABODE"" is the backup candidate.",Guess 4: adobe -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(✓) O(✓) B(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
