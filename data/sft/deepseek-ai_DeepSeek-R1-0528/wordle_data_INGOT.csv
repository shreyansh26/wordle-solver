We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position
 E: x -> not in the word

 Therefore, we know:
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since ""crane"" has N at position 4).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that includes N (since it's present) and avoids C, R, A, E.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, A, E. So we must use other letters.

 Let's think of a word that contains the letter N and four other letters that are not C, R, A, E.

 Since N is not at position 4, we can place N in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 We also need to maximize the use of common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants (besides the ones we eliminated) are S, T, L, D, etc. Vowels we can use are I, O, U (but A and E are out).

 Possible starting letters: We might try a word that starts with T or S.

 Since we know N is somewhere, let's try to put N in a different position. For example, position 5? Or position 1.

 Let me think of words that have the letter N and avoid C, R, A, E.

 Example words: 
   ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> but we don't know if O, I, T are present? We can try.

 But note: we should avoid repeated letters until we know they are present? Since we only have one N so far, but the word might have two N's? Feedback for N was a '-', meaning at least one N is present. It could have more?

 Given we know that N is in the word, and we have to avoid C,R,A,E, let's list possible letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 We want a word that has N and as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can try ""POINT"", but let me check if we can get more coverage.

 Another word: ""LIONS"" -> L,I,O,N,S. This has multiple common letters.

 However, note the feedback: we know N is not at position 4 (from ""crane"", which had N in the 4th position). So in ""LIONS"", the N is in the 4th position? Wait:

 ""LIONS"": L at 1, I at 2, O at 3, N at 4, S at 5.

 But in the previous guess, we had ""crane"" (N at 4) and we were told that N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, ""LIONS"" with N at position 4 is invalid because we know N is not at position 4. So we avoid that.

 We need a word where N is not at position 4.

 Possibilities:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"", ""NASTY"" (but we cannot use A -> eliminated) -> ""NOISY"" has O,I,S,Y -> avoiding A and E? A is eliminated.

   Let's check ""NOISY"": 
     N (position 1), O (2), I (3), S (4), Y (5) -> This avoids C,R,A,E? Yes.

   But is ""NOISY"" valid? We don't know yet.

   Another: ""POINT"": P (1), O (2), I (3), (N cannot be at 4 -> but we know that) so skip N at 4? We need N somewhere else? In ""POINT"", N is at position 4 -> not allowed? Actually, the feedback said N is in the word but not at the position we guessed (which was position 4). So we cannot put N at position 4 again? We can, but it would be incorrect again? Actually, we can, but it would not be efficient.

   But to avoid positions we know are wrong, we should put N at a different position.

   Let me think of words with N not at position 4:

   Position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NEXTS"" (but E is eliminated) -> E is out, so no. ""NUDGE"" -> E is out? E is eliminated.

   Position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"", ""INLAY"", ""UNTIL"" -> but U? that's fine.

   Position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" -> but N at 4? I need position 3: ""MINTS"" -> M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3.

   Position 5: ""POINT"" has N at 4? Not 5. ""FINES"" has E and S? E is out. ""GAINS"" has A -> out. ""TOWNS"" -> O,W,N,N,S? We don't know about repeating N.

   Actually, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicate N? Since we only placed one N and got a '-', meaning at least one N is present. It could be two? But we don't know.

   So, let me choose a word that places N in a new position and uses other common letters.

   Possible word: ""POINT"" is no good because N is at 4 and we know it's not at 4 (so it will be wrong). 

   How about ""MINTS""? 
     M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
     This avoids C,R,A,E? Yes.
     And we are placing N at position 3 (which we haven't tried before).

   Another option: ""SNOUT"" -> S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5 -> avoids A and E, and places N at 2.

   We can also consider ""THING"": T at 1, H at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5 -> but N at 4 is the same position? We know N is not at 4? So we avoid.

   So choices: 
     - ""MINTS"" -> N at 3 
     - ""SNOUT"" -> N at 2
     - ""NOISY"" -> N at 1

   We want to cover new letters. Which letters are common? We haven't tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E (and we know C,R,A,E are absent, N present).

   So we should test multiple new consonants and vowels.

   In ""NOISY"": letters N,O,I,S,Y -> covers O,I,S,Y. 
   In ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> covers M,I,T,S. 
   In ""SNOUT"": S,N,O,U,T -> covers S,O,U,T.

   Comparing: 
     ""NOISY"": has two vowels (O,I) and two consonants (S,Y) and N (consonant).
     ""MINTS"": two vowels (I) and M,N,T,S (consonants). 
     ""SNOUT"": two vowels (O,U) and S,N,T (consonants).

   Since we only have one known letter (N) and we are avoiding C,R,A,E, we can choose any of these.

   I think ""SNOUT"" is a good option because it has S and T which are common. Also, U and O are vowels.

   Or ""MINTS"" because it has T,S,M,I.

   But note: we also need to avoid positions? Only for N: we know N is not at position 4. 

   In ""SNOUT"", we place N at position 2 -> that's safe because we don't know about position 2? It could be correct or wrong? We haven't tested position 2.

   Similarly, in ""MINTS"", N at 3 -> we haven't tested position 3.

   So I'll choose ""SNOUT"" because it has more unique common letters? Actually, both are good.

   Alternatively, we can pick a word with the same letters? But let me choose.

   Let me list the frequency: We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word.

   We know the word has exactly one N? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates.

   Given we have limited information, let's pick ""SNOUT"".

   So my guess is ""SNOUT"".

Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position).

For the new guess:
- Must include **N** (confirmed present) and place it in a new position (not position 4).
- Avoid letters **C, R, A, E**.
- Use new common letters to gather information.

A strong next guess is **""SNOUT""**:
- S, N, O, U, T 
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Avoids bad letters and tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (S, T).

 But in the previous guess, we had ""crane"" (N at 4) and we were told that N is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, ""LIONS"" with N at position 4 is invalid because we know N is not at position 4. So we avoid that.

 We need a word where N is not at position 4.

 Possibilities:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NOISY"", ""NIGHT"", ""NASTY"" (but we cannot use A -> eliminated) -> ""NOISY"" has O,I,S,Y -> avoiding A and E? A is eliminated.

   Let's check ""NOISY"": 
     N (position 1), O (2), I (3), S (4), Y (5) -> This avoids C,R,A,E? Yes.

   But is ""NOISY"" valid? We don't know yet.

   Another: ""POINT"": P (1), O (2), I (3), (N cannot be at 4 -> but we know that) so skip N at 4? We need N somewhere else? In ""POINT"", N is at position 4 -> not allowed? Actually, the feedback said N is in the word but not at the position we guessed (which was position 4). So we cannot put N at position 4 again? We can, but it would be incorrect again? Actually, we can, but it would not be efficient.

   But to avoid positions we know are wrong, we should put N at a different position.

   Let me think of words with N not at position 4:

   Position 1: ""NOISY"", ""NEXTS"" (but E is eliminated) -> E is out, so no. ""NUDGE"" -> E is out? E is eliminated.

   Position 2: e.g., ""SNOWY"", ""INLAY"", ""UNTIL"" -> but U? that's fine.

   Position 3: e.g., ""POINT"" -> but N at 4? I need position 3: ""MINTS"" -> M,I,N,T,S -> N at position 3.

   Position 5: ""POINT"" has N at 4? Not 5. ""FINES"" has E and S? E is out. ""GAINS"" has A -> out. ""TOWNS"" -> O,W,N,N,S? We don't know about repeating N.

   Actually, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicate N? Since we only placed one N and got a '-', meaning at least one N is present. It could be two? But we don't know.

   So, let me choose a word that places N in a new position and uses other common letters.

   Possible word: ""POINT"" is no good because N is at 4 and we know it's not at 4 (so it will be wrong). 

   How about ""MINTS""? 
     M at 1, I at 2, N at 3, T at 4, S at 5.
     This avoids C,R,A,E? Yes.
     And we are placing N at position 3 (which we haven't tried before).

   Another option: ""SNOUT"" -> S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5 -> avoids A and E, and places N at 2.

   We can also consider ""THING"": T at 1, H at 2, I at 3, N at 4, G at 5 -> but N at 4 is the same position? We know N is not at 4? So we avoid.

   So choices: 
     - ""MINTS"" -> N at 3 
     - ""SNOUT"" -> N at 2
     - ""NOISY"" -> N at 1

   We want to cover new letters. Which letters are common? We haven't tested any letters except C,R,A,N,E (and we know C,R,A,E are absent, N present).

   So we should test multiple new consonants and vowels.

   In ""NOISY"": letters N,O,I,S,Y -> covers O,I,S,Y. 
   In ""MINTS"": M,I,N,T,S -> covers M,I,T,S. 
   In ""SNOUT"": S,N,O,U,T -> covers S,O,U,T.

   Comparing: 
     ""NOISY"": has two vowels (O,I) and two consonants (S,Y) and N (consonant).
     ""MINTS"": two vowels (I) and M,N,T,S (consonants). 
     ""SNOUT"": two vowels (O,U) and S,N,T (consonants).

   Since we only have one known letter (N) and we are avoiding C,R,A,E, we can choose any of these.

   I think ""SNOUT"" is a good option because it has S and T which are common. Also, U and O are vowels.

   Or ""MINTS"" because it has T,S,M,I.

   But note: we also need to avoid positions? Only for N: we know N is not at position 4. 

   In ""SNOUT"", we place N at position 2 -> that's safe because we don't know about position 2? It could be correct or wrong? We haven't tested position 2.

   Similarly, in ""MINTS"", N at 3 -> we haven't tested position 3.

   So I'll choose ""SNOUT"" because it has more unique common letters? Actually, both are good.

   Alternatively, we can pick a word with the same letters? But let me choose.

   Let me list the frequency: We want to maximize the chance of hitting the word.

   We know the word has exactly one N? Or at least one? But we don't know about duplicates.

   Given we have limited information, let's pick ""SNOUT"".

   So my guess is ""SNOUT"".

<guess>snout</guess>Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, E** are **not** in the secret word.
- **N** is in the word but **not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position).

For the new guess:
- Must include **N** (confirmed present) and place it in a new position (not position 4).
- Avoid letters **C, R, A, E**.
- Use new common letters to gather information.

A strong next guess is **""SNOUT""**:
- S, N, O, U, T 
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Avoids bad letters and tests new vowels (O, U) and consonants (S, T).

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) -> So the secret word contains N but not in position 4 (since N was at position 4 and marked wrong). Also, C, R, A, E are absent.
2. ""snout"": S(x), N(✓), O(-), U(x), T(✓) 
   - N(✓) at position 2: So N is at position 2. This confirms the N and places it correctly.
   - T(✓) at position 5: So T is at position 5.
   - O(-): O is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""snout"", O is at position 3). Also, O is present.
   - S(x) and U(x): S and U are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has: N at position 2, T at position 5, and O present but not at position 3. Also, O must be one of the remaining positions: 1, 4? Since position 2 is N and position 5 is T, the positions for O are 1 or 4? The word is 5 letters long: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  Position 2: N
  Position 5: T
  So O must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? Wait, in ""snout"", O was at position 3, and it was marked wrong position (-). So O is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, O must be at position 1 or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are taken by N and T respectively.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U (from both guesses).

Additionally, we have confirmed absent letters: C,R,A,E,S,U.

Now, we need to form a word that has:
- N in position 2
- T in position 5
- O in either position 1 or position 4? (but not position 3)
- The remaining letters must be from the unused letters. Also, we have one more position to fill? The word has 5 letters: let me denote the positions as [ _ , N, _ , _ , T ]

The possibilities for O are position 1 or position 4? But note position 4 was where we had N initially? Actually, position 4 could be O? But we must avoid the known absent letters.

We also have O present. Also, we have two more positions: position 1, position 3, and position 4. But since position 3 was O in the second guess and it was wrong, O cannot be at position 3. So O must be at either position 1 or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We have one more position that must be filled. Actually, two positions: position 1, position 3, and position 4? Wait no: 
The structure is:
Position 1: ? (must be O or another letter? If O is at position 1, then position 3 and 4 are open. But we know positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> with 2 and 5 fixed.

So we have:
Pos1: unknown (can be O or another letter, but O must be in the word so if not position1, then position4)
Pos2: N
Pos3: unknown (not O, because if O were here it would have been a match? But feedback says O is present but wrong position, and it was in position3, so it cannot be here? So we rule out position3 for O)
Pos4: unknown (can be O or another letter? But O hasn't been placed yet)
Pos5: T

Also, O must be in the word. So either O at position1 or position4?

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But so far no duplicates suggested.

Let me list the constraints:
- O is in the word at position1 or position4? Because positions 2 and 5 are fixed and position3 is ruled out by feedback.

Also, we must avoid C,R,A,E,S,U.

Now, what letters are possible? We have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4? But two unknowns? Actually, three positions: 1, 3, 4? But note: O takes one of position1 or position4? And then the other two positions must be filled by two other letters? Or if O is at position1, then positions 3 and 4 are the other letters? And similarly if O is at position4, then positions 1 and 3?

But wait, the word has exactly 5 distinct positions? We must assign letters.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O at position1. Then:
Word: O _ _ _ T -> but position2 is N. So: O N ? ? T

Then positions 3 and 4 are two letters to be determined. We don't know O or T? And they must be from the available letters excluding C,R,A,E,S,U.

Case 2: O at position4. Then:
Word: ? N ? O T

Positions 1 and 3 are to be filled.

In both cases, we need one more letter? Actually, we have three positions: 1,3,4 in the template? But in case1: O at1 -> then positions 3 and4 -> two positions. Case2: O at4 -> positions 1 and3 -> two positions.

But we haven't accounted for all. The word must have O in one of the positions and the rest.

But note: we might have more letters? And we know O is present. So let's list possible words.

Now, we also have feedback that in the first guess, N was present but not at position4. Now we know N is at position2, so that doesn't constrain position4 anymore.

What letters can we use? We have to avoid C,R,A,E,S,U. So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (but we already have O).

But note: O is already used? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? But we don't have any information about duplicates, so we can try without duplicates first.

We need to fill two more letters (besides O, N, T) for the two positions? And they must be different and not in the excluded list.

Now, let's generate guesses.

Given we have verified letters: N(2), T(5) and partial O.

To maximize information, we might want to test both possibilities for O? Or choose a word that places O in one of the positions and tests other letters.

We can make a guess that uses common letters for the unknowns.

First, let's consider case 1: O at position1 -> word: O N _ _ T

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Let me call them X and Y.

The word is: O N X Y T

Where X and Y must be letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,U} and not duplicates.

Similarly, case 2: word: X N Y O T

Where X and Y are two unknown letters.

But note: we need to choose a valid English word.

What are possible words?

For case 1: ON followed by two letters and then T.

Common words: 
  - ONTIC? but that has I and C, but C is out.
  - ONTIC isn't valid? We need valid English words.

List of words starting with ON? and ending with T? 
  - O N E S T -> has E and S (out) -> no.
  - O N L Y T -> but that's not 5 letters? Actually, the words must be 5 letters? 

Actually, we need 5 letters: 
  for ON _ _ T: the last letter must be T? So pattern ON??T.

Valid words with ON??T? 
  - O N T O T? But O repeated? And T? Also, positions: not.
  Let me think: 
  - O N I O T? But repeated O? And I not tested.
  - O N L Y T? Is ""ONLYT"" a word? No. ""O N L Y T"" is not 5 letters? ONLY has 4. 

Better to search. Common ON words: 
  - ONTIC? actually, ONTIC is a word? meaning philosophical. Letters: O,N,T,I,C -> but C is out? So we cannot use C. And also, T is at position5? Then here we have O at1, N at2, T at3? But we need T at5. So this doesn't fit.

We must have T at position5? So only ON??T.

Possible words: 
  - O N Y X T -> where ? must be such that ON_L_T? for example? Not common.

Another thought: maybe O at position1 doesn't lead to common words? So case1 might not hold.

Now case2: O at position4 -> word: X N Y O T

Pattern: _ N _ O T

Valid English words: 
  - I N D O T -> INDOT: not a word? or INDOT is not standard.
  - U N T O T? Untot? No. 
  - E N T O T? Entot? No. 
  - H N O O T? H N O O T -> repeated O? and ""HNOOT"" not a word.
  - Let me list common words: 
    * UNTOT? No.
    * BUT: We know we cannot use R,A,E,S,U? U is out? So U is eliminated.

So what are words ending with O T? Like pilot? But positions would be _ _ _ O T? 

But pattern is: position2: N, position4: O, position5: T -> so the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] O T

Examples: 
  - MINTOT? Not.
  - BUT: Consider ""INNOT"" -> not a word.
  - ""KN O T"" -> but that has only 4 letters.

Common words: 
  - ""O N T O T"" doesn't fit.

Actually, maybe there is a word: ""POINT"": P N? But P is first letter? But in ""POINT"", positions: P(1), O(2)? But we need O at position4? So no.

Another one: ""TONOT""? Not a word.

Alternate: We might reconsider the O position? But we have only two possibilities: pos1 or pos4?

Now, let's look at other words: 
  - How about ""DOGOT""? Not a word.

Perhaps there are words such as ""O N T O T"" -> but that would be O N T O T. But if T is at position3? Then in our pattern we need T at position5. So not.

Wait, maybe the word has O at position1? But pattern ON _ _ T? As in ""ONL Y T"" not. But what about ""ONCET""? But C and E are out? And not valid.

Before we get stuck, we must remember that in the feedback for ""snout"": O is present but not at position3. But it must be placed? And positions? The only two possibilities we see are position1 or position4? But could O be at position1? But no: in ""snout"" we didn't test position1? We tested S at position1 -> absent? But S is absent, so position1 was S? We have no information about O at position1? Because S was tested as absent? So O could be at position1? But S was absent? That doesn't rule out O.

Same for position4: in ""snout"", we had U at position4? U is absent? But position4 can be O? Because U was tested and absent? So O could be at position4? 

But let me think: why did we rule out position4 for O? We haven't. Because the feedback for O was in position3: so O is not at position3? But positions1 and4 are free and haven't been tested for O? So indeed O must be at position1 or position4.

But now we need an English word that matches one of:
Pattern 1: O N ? ? T
Pattern 2: ? N ? O T

And the two ? must be letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,U}.

Now, let's brainstorm words:

Pattern 1: ON something T -> possible words: 
  - ON Y X T? Few words: ""ONLYT""? Not, no. 
  - ""ONSET"" -> but S and E are out? So invalid.
  - ""ONTIC"" -> but T is not at the end? And it requires C. No.

Maybe no commonly used words? but we must rely on valid words.

Pattern 2: _ N _ O T

Possible words:
  - U N I O T? But U is out? Also, U is absent -> uniot? Not valid.
  - M I N O T? This is a valid word? MINOT? Actually, ""minot"" might refer to Minotaurus? But let's consider valid 5-letter words: 
      - ""MINOT"" -> not standard? But Wordle word list has many.
      - According to Wordle word list, it's accepted? We can try? But letters: M,I,N,O,T -> avoiding C,R,A,E,S,U? M,I,O,T,N -> valid? 
      But position2: N, position4: O, position5: T -> so we have: M at1, I at3, O at4? Then it could be ""MINOT""? Not standard.

Better look for common words: 
  - ""AN O T at"" -> but A is out? Also no.
  - ""KN O O T"" -> knot is not? K N O O T -> positions: K at1, N at2, O at3 (but O at3 is forbidden? Because in ""snout"", O at3 was marked wrong? So we cannot have O at3). So ""KNOTT""? That has O at3? But we can't have O at3? So we must avoid position3 for O.

Therefore, in pattern2: ? N ? O T, the letter at position3 must not be O? So we don't need to worry? That ? is a different letter.

Words: 
  - UNLOT? Unlot? Not standard.
  - BUT ""DONOT""? D O N O T -> but O at position2? We have fixed N at position2? So no.
  - ""P I N O T"" -> PINOT: like pinot wine. Pinot is a valid word? 
      PINOT: P at position1, I at position2? But we need N at position2? 
      So positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), T(5) -> not matching? We need N at position2? So not.

If we use PINOT: position2 is I? But we need N.

Another one: ""X N Y O T"" -> where X and Y are letters. 
  For example, ""B N Y O T"" -> must be a word? None.

What if we consider that the word might be ""MINOT""? But let me spell it: MINOT -> M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), T(5). 
But then position2 is I, and we need position2 to be N? So that doesn't work.

Therefore, we must have position2: N? So the word must have N at position2.

To be clear, the pattern is: _ N _ O T -> with O at position4? So position1: ?, position3: ?, position4: O, position5: T? But no: position5 is T? In MINOT, position5 is T? but positions:
  1: M
  2: I (should be N, but it is I)
  3: N (here is N) -> but we need N at2? 
  -> does not match.

We can try words where position2 is N? So the pattern is: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: N
  position3: ? 
  position4: O
  position5: T

But then position3 is not O? Because O is at4? That's fine.

Now my? Let me find words of the form: [letter1] N [letter3] O T

Valid words: 
  - I N T O T? Intot? Not a word.
  - E N D O T? Endot? Not.
  - I N G O T? INGOT: which is a bar of metal? 
    INGOT: I at1, N at2, G at3, O at4, T at5. -> matches pattern.

INGOT! This is valid. 
Does it avoid the bad letters? I, N, G, O, T -> 
  Avoid C,R,A,E,S,U? I is not in the forbidden list? Only forbidden are C,R,A,E,S,U -> so I is allowed? 
  Letters: I,N,G,O,T -> all fine.

Also, O is at position4? Valid. And position3 is G? Not O? Good.

Then this matches case2: O at position4? And the word would be INGOT.

But we also have the feedback from the first guess: crane had N at position4 marked wrong? But in this word, position4 is O, not N? So that should be fine? Because we have N at position2? And at the first guess we guessed N at4 and it was wrong? Which is true? In INGOT, N is at position2, so position4 has O? And N is not there? So that doesn't contradict.

Therefore, a candidate is ""INGOT"".

But we also have case1: O at position1? We haven't found a word for that pattern? But let's see if there is one. For the pattern O N ? ? T: 
  - Only one I can think of: O N I O T? But repeated letters? Not valid? And positions: O at1, N at2, I at3, O at4, T at5? Is there such a word? Not really.

But if we don't find a word for case1, then case2 is more likely? And ""INGOT"" fits.

But in feedback for ""snout"": O was marked as present but wrong position? And ""snout"" had O at position3? We are now placing O at position4? So O should appear as '-' feedback at position4 if we guess INGOT? But we are trying to guess INGOT? We don't know until we guess.

But let's make the guess. We can guess ""INGOT"".

Is there another word? What about ""PINTO""? 
  PINTO: 
    P at1, I at2? But position2 must be N? So not.

""ON TO T"" -> is ""ONSET"" invalid etc.

So I think ""INGOT"" is a good guess.

Let me confirm the letter usage:
  I: new letter
  G: new letter
  O: previously known present
  N: known at position2
  T: known at position5

And avoids C,R,A,E,S,U.

Therefore, this will tell us:
  If the word is ""INGOT"", we get all correct? N at2, T at5, O at4? And if not, we get feedback:

But note: we also know O should be in the word? So if we guess ""INGOT"", the feedback for O would be at position4? That's a new position.

Now, but in the secret word, if O is at position1? But then pattern O N _ _ T? We didn't find a word, but if we guess ""INGOT"", and if it is not the word, we might get feedback:

Positions:
1: I -> could be absent or present? We don't know.
2: N -> correct? ✓
3: G -> ?
4: O -> ? (if the word has O at position1, then O in ""INGOT"" at position4 would be an extra O? But the feedback will show '-' for O elsewhere? But we don't know until we guess.

Alternatively, we want to test? Given that we have only 6 tries, we need a word that tests both possibilities? But ""INGOT"" is efficient because it uses the knowns.

So I'll guess ""INGOT"".
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- **C, R, A, E, S, U** are **absent**.
- **N** is **correctly placed at position 2**.
- **T** is **correctly placed at position 5**.
- **O** is **present** but **not at position 3**.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `[position1] N [position3] [position4] T`.
2. **O must be at position 1 or 4** (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed/eliminated).
3. New letters must avoid the absent set `{C, R, A, E, S, U}`.

Considering English words, a valid candidate is **""INGOT""**:
- Fits the pattern (`I N G O T`).
- Places O at **position 4** (a possible location).
- Tests new common letters (`I` and `G`).
- Avoids forbidden letters.

This guess tests the placement of O while leveraging known truths at positions 2 and 5.

<guess>ingot</guess>",ingot,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x) -> So the secret word contains N but not in position 4 (since N was at position 4 and marked wrong). Also, C, R, A, E are absent.
2. ""snout"": S(x), N(✓), O(-), U(x), T(✓) 
   - N(✓) at position 2: So N is at position 2. This confirms the N and places it correctly.
   - T(✓) at position 5: So T is at position 5.
   - O(-): O is in the word but not at position 3 (since in ""snout"", O is at position 3). Also, O is present.
   - S(x) and U(x): S and U are absent.

From this, we know:
- The secret word has: N at position 2, T at position 5, and O present but not at position 3. Also, O must be one of the remaining positions: 1, 4? Since position 2 is N and position 5 is T, the positions for O are 1 or 4? The word is 5 letters long: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
  Position 2: N
  Position 5: T
  So O must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? Wait, in ""snout"", O was at position 3, and it was marked wrong position (-). So O is in the word but not at position 3. Therefore, O must be at position 1 or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are taken by N and T respectively.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, E, S, U (from both guesses).

Additionally, we have confirmed absent letters: C,R,A,E,S,U.

Now, we need to form a word that has:
- N in position 2
- T in position 5
- O in either position 1 or position 4? (but not position 3)
- The remaining letters must be from the unused letters. Also, we have one more position to fill? The word has 5 letters: let me denote the positions as [ _ , N, _ , _ , T ]

The possibilities for O are position 1 or position 4? But note position 4 was where we had N initially? Actually, position 4 could be O? But we must avoid the known absent letters.

We also have O present. Also, we have two more positions: position 1, position 3, and position 4. But since position 3 was O in the second guess and it was wrong, O cannot be at position 3. So O must be at either position 1 or 4.

Now, what about the other letters? We have one more position that must be filled. Actually, two positions: position 1, position 3, and position 4? Wait no: 
The structure is:
Position 1: ? (must be O or another letter? If O is at position 1, then position 3 and 4 are open. But we know positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> with 2 and 5 fixed.

So we have:
Pos1: unknown (can be O or another letter, but O must be in the word so if not position1, then position4)
Pos2: N
Pos3: unknown (not O, because if O were here it would have been a match? But feedback says O is present but wrong position, and it was in position3, so it cannot be here? So we rule out position3 for O)
Pos4: unknown (can be O or another letter? But O hasn't been placed yet)
Pos5: T

Also, O must be in the word. So either O at position1 or position4?

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But so far no duplicates suggested.

Let me list the constraints:
- O is in the word at position1 or position4? Because positions 2 and 5 are fixed and position3 is ruled out by feedback.

Also, we must avoid C,R,A,E,S,U.

Now, what letters are possible? We have to fill positions 1, 3, and 4? But two unknowns? Actually, three positions: 1, 3, 4? But note: O takes one of position1 or position4? And then the other two positions must be filled by two other letters? Or if O is at position1, then positions 3 and 4 are the other letters? And similarly if O is at position4, then positions 1 and 3?

But wait, the word has exactly 5 distinct positions? We must assign letters.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O at position1. Then:
Word: O _ _ _ T -> but position2 is N. So: O N ? ? T

Then positions 3 and 4 are two letters to be determined. We don't know O or T? And they must be from the available letters excluding C,R,A,E,S,U.

Case 2: O at position4. Then:
Word: ? N ? O T

Positions 1 and 3 are to be filled.

In both cases, we need one more letter? Actually, we have three positions: 1,3,4 in the template? But in case1: O at1 -> then positions 3 and4 -> two positions. Case2: O at4 -> positions 1 and3 -> two positions.

But we haven't accounted for all. The word must have O in one of the positions and the rest.

But note: we might have more letters? And we know O is present. So let's list possible words.

Now, we also have feedback that in the first guess, N was present but not at position4. Now we know N is at position2, so that doesn't constrain position4 anymore.

What letters can we use? We have to avoid C,R,A,E,S,U. So available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (but we already have O).

But note: O is already used? We don't know if repeated letters are allowed? But we don't have any information about duplicates, so we can try without duplicates first.

We need to fill two more letters (besides O, N, T) for the two positions? And they must be different and not in the excluded list.

Now, let's generate guesses.

Given we have verified letters: N(2), T(5) and partial O.

To maximize information, we might want to test both possibilities for O? Or choose a word that places O in one of the positions and tests other letters.

We can make a guess that uses common letters for the unknowns.

First, let's consider case 1: O at position1 -> word: O N _ _ T

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4. Let me call them X and Y.

The word is: O N X Y T

Where X and Y must be letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,U} and not duplicates.

Similarly, case 2: word: X N Y O T

Where X and Y are two unknown letters.

But note: we need to choose a valid English word.

What are possible words?

For case 1: ON followed by two letters and then T.

Common words: 
  - ONTIC? but that has I and C, but C is out.
  - ONTIC isn't valid? We need valid English words.

List of words starting with ON? and ending with T? 
  - O N E S T -> has E and S (out) -> no.
  - O N L Y T -> but that's not 5 letters? Actually, the words must be 5 letters? 

Actually, we need 5 letters: 
  for ON _ _ T: the last letter must be T? So pattern ON??T.

Valid words with ON??T? 
  - O N T O T? But O repeated? And T? Also, positions: not.
  Let me think: 
  - O N I O T? But repeated O? And I not tested.
  - O N L Y T? Is ""ONLYT"" a word? No. ""O N L Y T"" is not 5 letters? ONLY has 4. 

Better to search. Common ON words: 
  - ONTIC? actually, ONTIC is a word? meaning philosophical. Letters: O,N,T,I,C -> but C is out? So we cannot use C. And also, T is at position5? Then here we have O at1, N at2, T at3? But we need T at5. So this doesn't fit.

We must have T at position5? So only ON??T.

Possible words: 
  - O N Y X T -> where ? must be such that ON_L_T? for example? Not common.

Another thought: maybe O at position1 doesn't lead to common words? So case1 might not hold.

Now case2: O at position4 -> word: X N Y O T

Pattern: _ N _ O T

Valid English words: 
  - I N D O T -> INDOT: not a word? or INDOT is not standard.
  - U N T O T? Untot? No. 
  - E N T O T? Entot? No. 
  - H N O O T? H N O O T -> repeated O? and ""HNOOT"" not a word.
  - Let me list common words: 
    * UNTOT? No.
    * BUT: We know we cannot use R,A,E,S,U? U is out? So U is eliminated.

So what are words ending with O T? Like pilot? But positions would be _ _ _ O T? 

But pattern is: position2: N, position4: O, position5: T -> so the word must be: [letter1] N [letter3] O T

Examples: 
  - MINTOT? Not.
  - BUT: Consider ""INNOT"" -> not a word.
  - ""KN O T"" -> but that has only 4 letters.

Common words: 
  - ""O N T O T"" doesn't fit.

Actually, maybe there is a word: ""POINT"": P N? But P is first letter? But in ""POINT"", positions: P(1), O(2)? But we need O at position4? So no.

Another one: ""TONOT""? Not a word.

Alternate: We might reconsider the O position? But we have only two possibilities: pos1 or pos4?

Now, let's look at other words: 
  - How about ""DOGOT""? Not a word.

Perhaps there are words such as ""O N T O T"" -> but that would be O N T O T. But if T is at position3? Then in our pattern we need T at position5. So not.

Wait, maybe the word has O at position1? But pattern ON _ _ T? As in ""ONL Y T"" not. But what about ""ONCET""? But C and E are out? And not valid.

Before we get stuck, we must remember that in the feedback for ""snout"": O is present but not at position3. But it must be placed? And positions? The only two possibilities we see are position1 or position4? But could O be at position1? But no: in ""snout"" we didn't test position1? We tested S at position1 -> absent? But S is absent, so position1 was S? We have no information about O at position1? Because S was tested as absent? So O could be at position1? But S was absent? That doesn't rule out O.

Same for position4: in ""snout"", we had U at position4? U is absent? But position4 can be O? Because U was tested and absent? So O could be at position4? 

But let me think: why did we rule out position4 for O? We haven't. Because the feedback for O was in position3: so O is not at position3? But positions1 and4 are free and haven't been tested for O? So indeed O must be at position1 or position4.

But now we need an English word that matches one of:
Pattern 1: O N ? ? T
Pattern 2: ? N ? O T

And the two ? must be letters not in {C,R,A,E,S,U}.

Now, let's brainstorm words:

Pattern 1: ON something T -> possible words: 
  - ON Y X T? Few words: ""ONLYT""? Not, no. 
  - ""ONSET"" -> but S and E are out? So invalid.
  - ""ONTIC"" -> but T is not at the end? And it requires C. No.

Maybe no commonly used words? but we must rely on valid words.

Pattern 2: _ N _ O T

Possible words:
  - U N I O T? But U is out? Also, U is absent -> uniot? Not valid.
  - M I N O T? This is a valid word? MINOT? Actually, ""minot"" might refer to Minotaurus? But let's consider valid 5-letter words: 
      - ""MINOT"" -> not standard? But Wordle word list has many.
      - According to Wordle word list, it's accepted? We can try? But letters: M,I,N,O,T -> avoiding C,R,A,E,S,U? M,I,O,T,N -> valid? 
      But position2: N, position4: O, position5: T -> so we have: M at1, I at3, O at4? Then it could be ""MINOT""? Not standard.

Better look for common words: 
  - ""AN O T at"" -> but A is out? Also no.
  - ""KN O O T"" -> knot is not? K N O O T -> positions: K at1, N at2, O at3 (but O at3 is forbidden? Because in ""snout"", O at3 was marked wrong? So we cannot have O at3). So ""KNOTT""? That has O at3? But we can't have O at3? So we must avoid position3 for O.

Therefore, in pattern2: ? N ? O T, the letter at position3 must not be O? So we don't need to worry? That ? is a different letter.

Words: 
  - UNLOT? Unlot? Not standard.
  - BUT ""DONOT""? D O N O T -> but O at position2? We have fixed N at position2? So no.
  - ""P I N O T"" -> PINOT: like pinot wine. Pinot is a valid word? 
      PINOT: P at position1, I at position2? But we need N at position2? 
      So positions: P(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), T(5) -> not matching? We need N at position2? So not.

If we use PINOT: position2 is I? But we need N.

Another one: ""X N Y O T"" -> where X and Y are letters. 
  For example, ""B N Y O T"" -> must be a word? None.

What if we consider that the word might be ""MINOT""? But let me spell it: MINOT -> M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), T(5). 
But then position2 is I, and we need position2 to be N? So that doesn't work.

Therefore, we must have position2: N? So the word must have N at position2.

To be clear, the pattern is: _ N _ O T -> with O at position4? So position1: ?, position3: ?, position4: O, position5: T? But no: position5 is T? In MINOT, position5 is T? but positions:
  1: M
  2: I (should be N, but it is I)
  3: N (here is N) -> but we need N at2? 
  -> does not match.

We can try words where position2 is N? So the pattern is: 
  position1: ? 
  position2: N
  position3: ? 
  position4: O
  position5: T

But then position3 is not O? Because O is at4? That's fine.

Now my? Let me find words of the form: [letter1] N [letter3] O T

Valid words: 
  - I N T O T? Intot? Not a word.
  - E N D O T? Endot? Not.
  - I N G O T? INGOT: which is a bar of metal? 
    INGOT: I at1, N at2, G at3, O at4, T at5. -> matches pattern.

INGOT! This is valid. 
Does it avoid the bad letters? I, N, G, O, T -> 
  Avoid C,R,A,E,S,U? I is not in the forbidden list? Only forbidden are C,R,A,E,S,U -> so I is allowed? 
  Letters: I,N,G,O,T -> all fine.

Also, O is at position4? Valid. And position3 is G? Not O? Good.

Then this matches case2: O at position4? And the word would be INGOT.

But we also have the feedback from the first guess: crane had N at position4 marked wrong? But in this word, position4 is O, not N? So that should be fine? Because we have N at position2? And at the first guess we guessed N at4 and it was wrong? Which is true? In INGOT, N is at position2, so position4 has O? And N is not there? So that doesn't contradict.

Therefore, a candidate is ""INGOT"".

But we also have case1: O at position1? We haven't found a word for that pattern? But let's see if there is one. For the pattern O N ? ? T: 
  - Only one I can think of: O N I O T? But repeated letters? Not valid? And positions: O at1, N at2, I at3, O at4, T at5? Is there such a word? Not really.

But if we don't find a word for case1, then case2 is more likely? And ""INGOT"" fits.

But in feedback for ""snout"": O was marked as present but wrong position? And ""snout"" had O at position3? We are now placing O at position4? So O should appear as '-' feedback at position4 if we guess INGOT? But we are trying to guess INGOT? We don't know until we guess.

But let's make the guess. We can guess ""INGOT"".

Is there another word? What about ""PINTO""? 
  PINTO: 
    P at1, I at2? But position2 must be N? So not.

""ON TO T"" -> is ""ONSET"" invalid etc.

So I think ""INGOT"" is a good guess.

Let me confirm the letter usage:
  I: new letter
  G: new letter
  O: previously known present
  N: known at position2
  T: known at position5

And avoids C,R,A,E,S,U.

Therefore, this will tell us:
  If the word is ""INGOT"", we get all correct? N at2, T at5, O at4? And if not, we get feedback:

But note: we also know O should be in the word? So if we guess ""INGOT"", the feedback for O would be at position4? That's a new position.

Now, but in the secret word, if O is at position1? But then pattern O N _ _ T? We didn't find a word, but if we guess ""INGOT"", and if it is not the word, we might get feedback:

Positions:
1: I -> could be absent or present? We don't know.
2: N -> correct? ✓
3: G -> ?
4: O -> ? (if the word has O at position1, then O in ""INGOT"" at position4 would be an extra O? But the feedback will show '-' for O elsewhere? But we don't know until we guess.

Alternatively, we want to test? Given that we have only 6 tries, we need a word that tests both possibilities? But ""INGOT"" is efficient because it uses the knowns.

So I'll guess ""INGOT"".Based on previous feedback:
- **C, R, A, E, S, U** are **absent**.
- **N** is **correctly placed at position 2**.
- **T** is **correctly placed at position 5**.
- **O** is **present** but **not at position 3**.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `[position1] N [position3] [position4] T`.
2. **O must be at position 1 or 4** (since positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed/eliminated).
3. New letters must avoid the absent set `{C, R, A, E, S, U}`.

Considering English words, a valid candidate is **""INGOT""**:
- Fits the pattern (`I N G O T`).
- Places O at **position 4** (a possible location).
- Tests new common letters (`I` and `G`).
- Avoids forbidden letters.

This guess tests the placement of O while leveraging known truths at positions 2 and 5.",Guess 3: ingot -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
