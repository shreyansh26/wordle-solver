We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has:
- Common letters: to cover frequent letters in the English language.
- No repeated letters: to check more distinct letters.

Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. Let me pick one that is likely to be accepted and provides a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 5 distinct letters.
- It includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- It is a valid word.

So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

- Common vowels and consonants: to cover frequent letters in English words.
- No repeating letters: to test as many distinct letters as possible.
- A balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. However, alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" are also strong. 

Between these, ""CRANE"" is a solid choice:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct.
- It has been statistically shown to cover a wide range of possible words.

Therefore, I'll start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback efficiently.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

Key information:
- Letters present: A and E (each appearing at least once, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""crane"")
- Letters absent: C, R, N

Since ""crane"" has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, the A cannot be in the 3rd position of the secret word, and E cannot be in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter word that includes A and E, and excludes C, R, N.
- Ideally, I should test other common letters not yet tried to get more information.
- Letters not yet tested include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels to cover: O, I, U might be good, but since A and E are already present, perhaps focus on consonants.

Possible letters to consider: S, T, L, D, etc., as they appear frequently.

I want to place A and E in new positions since they can't be in position 3 or 5 respectively from the previous guess.

For example:
- A was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- E was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I should avoid putting A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Possible words: Let's think of words containing A and E.

A good candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""LEAST"", but ""slate"" has S, L, A, T, E – and we haven't tested S, L, or T yet.

However, ""slate"" has E in the 5th position, which we know can't be correct from feedback (since E got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position, so placing E at the end again might not be optimal).

In ""crane"", E was guessed in position 5 and it's not correct, so in ""slate"", E is also in position 5, so it might get the same feedback for E.

I should try a word where E is not in position 5.

For instance, place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's think: since A cannot be in position 3, I need to place it elsewhere.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 1, 2, or 4
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Moreover, I want to test new letters.

One common starting word after feedback like this is to use ""ALIEN"" or something, but we know that C, R, N are absent, so ""alien"" uses A and E, but has L and I, which are untested.

""Alien"":
- A in position 1 (which is a possible spot for A)
- L in position 2
- I in position 3
- E in position 4 (not position 5, good)
- N in position 5 – but N is absent! We know N is not in the word, so I cannot use N because I got N(x) in previous feedback.

I cannot use N.

Similarly, avoid C, R, N.

So ""ALIEN"" is invalid because it has N.

How about ""ALIVE"": A in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5. But E in 5 – we want to avoid E in position 5 because it's wrong (E was in 5 and got '-', meaning E is not in that position).

""ALIVE"" has E in position 5, same as before.

Better to have E not in 5.

Let's think of words with E not at the end.

Examples: ""TABLE"" but that has E at the end again. ""TALES"", E in position 5? ""Tales"" is T-A-L-E-S, E in 4? Position: T-1, A-2, L-3, E-4, S-5. ""TALES"" has E in position 4.

Similarly, ""TARES"" but R is absent.

Since R is absent, avoid TARES.

Possible words: ""SAUTE"" – S-A-U-T-E, E in position 5 not good.

""SHADE"" – S-H-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

I need a word with E not in position 5 and A not in position 3.

Common word: ""PSALM"" but no E.

""PLANE"" – P-L-A-N-E, but N is absent so not good.

""SPADE"" – S-P-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

""LATER"" – L-A-T-E-R, but R is absent so not good.

""DATE"" is only 4 letters.

""OVATE"" – O-V-A-T-E, E in 5.

Perhaps I should accept E in position 5 for now to test other letters, but it might be inefficient since we know E is not there.

From feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5, so guessing E in position 5 again would give '-' for E, not adding new position information.

Similarly for A.

To maximize info, I should guess A in a different position and E in a different position.

A was in position 3, so try position 1, 2, or 4.

E was in position 5, so try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Idea: place A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Words like ""ABUSE"": A-B-U-S-E – A in 1, E in 5 not good. E in position 5.

""ADIEU"": A-D-I-E-U – E in position 4? Positions: A-1, D-2, I-3, E-4, U-5. So E is in position 4.

""ADIEU"" is a valid word and commonly used in Wordle.

It has A in position 1 (new position for A) and E in position 4 (new for E).

Also, letters D, I, U are untested.

But U is less common; maybe there are better choices.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but E in 5.

""ALIKE"" – A-L-I-K-E, E in 5.

""AMUSE"" – A-M-U-S-E, E in 5.

How about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E, E in 5.

I think I might need to accept E in position 4 or another middle position.

""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position 3 for A was already incorrect? No, A can be in other spots.

In ""DEALT"": D-1,E-2,A-3,L-4,T-5.

A is in position 3 again. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong position. From feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, putting A in position 3 again would not be correct and will give '-' again, which doesn't help distinguish the position.

Similarly, for E in position 5, if I guess it again, it would be '-'.

To get new information, I should avoid placing A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Therefore, for ""DEALT"", A is in position 3, which is bad to guess again.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has A in position 2, E in position 5 – E in 5 not good.

""LEAST"": L-E-A-S-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position: L-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A is in position 3, which should be avoided.

If I can find a word with A not in 3 and E not in 5.

What about ""STARE""? S-T-A-R-E, but R is absent, so not good.

""TEAMS"": T-E-A-M-S – E in position 1? T-1? Position: T-1, E-2, A-3, M-4, S-5.

A is in position 3, which is bad.

How to rearrange?

I need to put A in position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E – A in position 2, E in position 5.

Better A in position 2, but E still in 5.

""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, same issue.

""SALAD"" no E.

""BEAST"": B-E-A-S-T – E in position 1? Positions: B-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A in position 3 again.

I'm struggling.

Let's list positions: let position 1,2,3,4,5.

A can be in 1,2,4.

E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, the secret word has exactly these letters: A and E are present.

Now, possible word: ""WEARY"" but has W and Y, less common.

Or ""YEARN"", but N absent and R absent.

Bad.

""HEART"" – H-E-A-R-T, but R absent.

What about ""STEAL"": S-T-E-A-L – positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, A-4, L-5.

A is in position 4 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).

And letters S,T,L are not tested.

""STEAL"" seems good:
- S not tested
- T not tested
- E in position 3 (was not guessed in position 3 before; previously E was in position 5)
- A in position 4 (previously in position 3)
- L not tested

Also, not using forbidden letters.

Valid word.

To maximize common letters, but I think ""STEAL"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""SLATE"" , but ""slate"": S-1, L-2, A-3, T-4, E-5 – A in position 3 which is bad, E in position 5 which is bad. Avoid.

""PEACH"" no E at the end, but C is absent, not good.

So ""STEAL"" might be a good choice.

Or ""STELA"" – same as STEAL, variant spelling.

But STEAL is common.

""DREAM"" – D-R-E-A-M, but R absent.

Not good.

""ALONE"" – A-1, L-2, O-3, N-4, E-5 – but N absent, and E in 5.

Not good.

""ABLED"" – A-1, B-2, L-3, E-4, D-5 – E in position 4, A in position 1.

This could work: A not in 3, E not in 5.

Letters: B,L,E,D.

B, L, D are untested.

""ABLED"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AGILE"" has G,I,L,E – A-1,G-2,I-3,L-4,E-5 – E in 5 not good.

"" ""AMBER"" – A-1,M-2,B-3,E-4,R-4? E-4, but R absent.

Not good.

""SHAPE"" – S-1,H-2,A-3,P-4,E-5 – A in position 3, E in 5, worse.

So between ""STEAL"" and ""ABLED"", I prefer ""STEAL"" because it has common letters like S and T, which might yield more information.

""STEAL"" puts E in the middle.

I think ""STEAL"" is fine.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but no E, and we know E is present, but I can guess it to test vowels, but I already know A and E are present, so I should include both to confirm positions.

I think including A and E is better.

Another word: ""OCEAN"" but C absent and N absent.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""STEAL"".
</think>
<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: absent (x) → not in the word
- R: absent (x) → not in the word
- A: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect)
- N: absent (x) → not in the word
- E: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect)

Therefore:
- The secret word contains A and E.
- Excludes C, R, N.
- A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E to gather position information.
- Avoid positions where A and E are already known to be incorrect: A not in position 3, E not in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Test new common letters to gain more coverage (e.g., S, T, L).

Chose ""STEAL"" as the guess:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), A (4), L (5)
  - E is placed in position 3 (new position, not tested before).
  - A is placed in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 3 from previous guess).
- Uses untested letters S, T, L.
- Valid 5-letter English word.
- Maximizes information potential by testing frequent consonants and rearranging A and E positions.

Idea: place A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Words like ""ABUSE"": A-B-U-S-E – A in 1, E in 5 not good. E in position 5.

""ADIEU"": A-D-I-E-U – E in position 4? Positions: A-1, D-2, I-3, E-4, U-5. So E is in position 4.

""ADIEU"" is a valid word and commonly used in Wordle.

It has A in position 1 (new position for A) and E in position 4 (new for E).

Also, letters D, I, U are untested.

But U is less common; maybe there are better choices.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but E in 5.

""ALIKE"" – A-L-I-K-E, E in 5.

""AMUSE"" – A-M-U-S-E, E in 5.

How about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E, E in 5.

I think I might need to accept E in position 4 or another middle position.

""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position 3 for A was already incorrect? No, A can be in other spots.

In ""DEALT"": D-1,E-2,A-3,L-4,T-5.

A is in position 3 again. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong position. From feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, putting A in position 3 again would not be correct and will give '-' again, which doesn't help distinguish the position.

Similarly, for E in position 5, if I guess it again, it would be '-'.

To get new information, I should avoid placing A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Therefore, for ""DEALT"", A is in position 3, which is bad to guess again.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has A in position 2, E in position 5 – E in 5 not good.

""LEAST"": L-E-A-S-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position: L-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A is in position 3, which should be avoided.

If I can find a word with A not in 3 and E not in 5.

What about ""STARE""? S-T-A-R-E, but R is absent, so not good.

""TEAMS"": T-E-A-M-S – E in position 1? T-1? Position: T-1, E-2, A-3, M-4, S-5.

A is in position 3, which is bad.

How to rearrange?

I need to put A in position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E – A in position 2, E in position 5.

Better A in position 2, but E still in 5.

""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, same issue.

""SALAD"" no E.

""BEAST"": B-E-A-S-T – E in position 1? Positions: B-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A in position 3 again.

I'm struggling.

Let's list positions: let position 1,2,3,4,5.

A can be in 1,2,4.

E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, the secret word has exactly these letters: A and E are present.

Now, possible word: ""WEARY"" but has W and Y, less common.

Or ""YEARN"", but N absent and R absent.

Bad.

""HEART"" – H-E-A-R-T, but R absent.

What about ""STEAL"": S-T-E-A-L – positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, A-4, L-5.

A is in position 4 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).

And letters S,T,L are not tested.

""STEAL"" seems good:
- S not tested
- T not tested
- E in position 3 (was not guessed in position 3 before; previously E was in position 5)
- A in position 4 (previously in position 3)
- L not tested

Also, not using forbidden letters.

Valid word.

To maximize common letters, but I think ""STEAL"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""SLATE"" , but ""slate"": S-1, L-2, A-3, T-4, E-5 – A in position 3 which is bad, E in position 5 which is bad. Avoid.

""PEACH"" no E at the end, but C is absent, not good.

So ""STEAL"" might be a good choice.

Or ""STELA"" – same as STEAL, variant spelling.

But STEAL is common.

""DREAM"" – D-R-E-A-M, but R absent.

Not good.

""ALONE"" – A-1, L-2, O-3, N-4, E-5 – but N absent, and E in 5.

Not good.

""ABLED"" – A-1, B-2, L-3, E-4, D-5 – E in position 4, A in position 1.

This could work: A not in 3, E not in 5.

Letters: B,L,E,D.

B, L, D are untested.

""ABLED"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AGILE"" has G,I,L,E – A-1,G-2,I-3,L-4,E-5 – E in 5 not good.

"" ""AMBER"" – A-1,M-2,B-3,E-4,R-4? E-4, but R absent.

Not good.

""SHAPE"" – S-1,H-2,A-3,P-4,E-5 – A in position 3, E in 5, worse.

So between ""STEAL"" and ""ABLED"", I prefer ""STEAL"" because it has common letters like S and T, which might yield more information.

""STEAL"" puts E in the middle.

I think ""STEAL"" is fine.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but no E, and we know E is present, but I can guess it to test vowels, but I already know A and E are present, so I should include both to confirm positions.

I think including A and E is better.

Another word: ""OCEAN"" but C absent and N absent.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""STEAL"".<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: absent (x) → not in the word
- R: absent (x) → not in the word
- A: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect)
- N: absent (x) → not in the word
- E: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect)

Therefore:
- The secret word contains A and E.
- Excludes C, R, N.
- A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E to gather position information.
- Avoid positions where A and E are already known to be incorrect: A not in position 3, E not in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Test new common letters to gain more coverage (e.g., S, T, L).

Chose ""STEAL"" as the guess:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), A (4), L (5)
  - E is placed in position 3 (new position, not tested before).
  - A is placed in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 3 from previous guess).
- Uses untested letters S, T, L.
- Valid 5-letter English word.
- Maximizes information potential by testing frequent consonants and rearranging A and E positions.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BEGAT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has:
- Common letters: to cover frequent letters in the English language.
- No repeated letters: to check more distinct letters.

Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. Let me pick one that is likely to be accepted and provides a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 5 distinct letters.
- It includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- It is a valid word.

So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thought>
I am playing Wordle and need to make the first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically involves selecting a word with:
- Common vowels and consonants: to cover frequent letters in English words.
- No repeating letters: to test as many distinct letters as possible.
- A balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. However, alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" are also strong. 

Between these, ""CRANE"" is a solid choice:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct.
- It has been statistically shown to cover a wide range of possible words.

Therefore, I'll start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback efficiently.
</thought>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

Key information:
- Letters present: A and E (each appearing at least once, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""crane"")
- Letters absent: C, R, N

Since ""crane"" has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, the A cannot be in the 3rd position of the secret word, and E cannot be in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter word that includes A and E, and excludes C, R, N.
- Ideally, I should test other common letters not yet tried to get more information.
- Letters not yet tested include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels to cover: O, I, U might be good, but since A and E are already present, perhaps focus on consonants.

Possible letters to consider: S, T, L, D, etc., as they appear frequently.

I want to place A and E in new positions since they can't be in position 3 or 5 respectively from the previous guess.

For example:
- A was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- E was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I should avoid putting A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Possible words: Let's think of words containing A and E.

A good candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""LEAST"", but ""slate"" has S, L, A, T, E – and we haven't tested S, L, or T yet.

However, ""slate"" has E in the 5th position, which we know can't be correct from feedback (since E got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position, so placing E at the end again might not be optimal).

In ""crane"", E was guessed in position 5 and it's not correct, so in ""slate"", E is also in position 5, so it might get the same feedback for E.

I should try a word where E is not in position 5.

For instance, place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's think: since A cannot be in position 3, I need to place it elsewhere.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 1, 2, or 4
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Moreover, I want to test new letters.

One common starting word after feedback like this is to use ""ALIEN"" or something, but we know that C, R, N are absent, so ""alien"" uses A and E, but has L and I, which are untested.

""Alien"":
- A in position 1 (which is a possible spot for A)
- L in position 2
- I in position 3
- E in position 4 (not position 5, good)
- N in position 5 – but N is absent! We know N is not in the word, so I cannot use N because I got N(x) in previous feedback.

I cannot use N.

Similarly, avoid C, R, N.

So ""ALIEN"" is invalid because it has N.

How about ""ALIVE"": A in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5. But E in 5 – we want to avoid E in position 5 because it's wrong (E was in 5 and got '-', meaning E is not in that position).

""ALIVE"" has E in position 5, same as before.

Better to have E not in 5.

Let's think of words with E not at the end.

Examples: ""TABLE"" but that has E at the end again. ""TALES"", E in position 5? ""Tales"" is T-A-L-E-S, E in 4? Position: T-1, A-2, L-3, E-4, S-5. ""TALES"" has E in position 4.

Similarly, ""TARES"" but R is absent.

Since R is absent, avoid TARES.

Possible words: ""SAUTE"" – S-A-U-T-E, E in position 5 not good.

""SHADE"" – S-H-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

I need a word with E not in position 5 and A not in position 3.

Common word: ""PSALM"" but no E.

""PLANE"" – P-L-A-N-E, but N is absent so not good.

""SPADE"" – S-P-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

""LATER"" – L-A-T-E-R, but R is absent so not good.

""DATE"" is only 4 letters.

""OVATE"" – O-V-A-T-E, E in 5.

Perhaps I should accept E in position 5 for now to test other letters, but it might be inefficient since we know E is not there.

From feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5, so guessing E in position 5 again would give '-' for E, not adding new position information.

Similarly for A.

To maximize info, I should guess A in a different position and E in a different position.

A was in position 3, so try position 1, 2, or 4.

E was in position 5, so try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Idea: place A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Words like ""ABUSE"": A-B-U-S-E – A in 1, E in 5 not good. E in position 5.

""ADIEU"": A-D-I-E-U – E in position 4? Positions: A-1, D-2, I-3, E-4, U-5. So E is in position 4.

""ADIEU"" is a valid word and commonly used in Wordle.

It has A in position 1 (new position for A) and E in position 4 (new for E).

Also, letters D, I, U are untested.

But U is less common; maybe there are better choices.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but E in 5.

""ALIKE"" – A-L-I-K-E, E in 5.

""AMUSE"" – A-M-U-S-E, E in 5.

How about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E, E in 5.

I think I might need to accept E in position 4 or another middle position.

""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position 3 for A was already incorrect? No, A can be in other spots.

In ""DEALT"": D-1,E-2,A-3,L-4,T-5.

A is in position 3 again. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong position. From feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, putting A in position 3 again would not be correct and will give '-' again, which doesn't help distinguish the position.

Similarly, for E in position 5, if I guess it again, it would be '-'.

To get new information, I should avoid placing A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Therefore, for ""DEALT"", A is in position 3, which is bad to guess again.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has A in position 2, E in position 5 – E in 5 not good.

""LEAST"": L-E-A-S-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position: L-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A is in position 3, which should be avoided.

If I can find a word with A not in 3 and E not in 5.

What about ""STARE""? S-T-A-R-E, but R is absent, so not good.

""TEAMS"": T-E-A-M-S – E in position 1? T-1? Position: T-1, E-2, A-3, M-4, S-5.

A is in position 3, which is bad.

How to rearrange?

I need to put A in position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E – A in position 2, E in position 5.

Better A in position 2, but E still in 5.

""SALAD"" no E.

""BEAST"": B-E-A-S-T – E in position 1? Positions: B-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A in position 3 again.

I'm struggling.

Let's list positions: let position 1,2,3,4,5.

A can be in 1,2,4.

E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, the secret word has exactly these letters: A and E are present.

Now, possible word: ""WEARY"" but has W and Y, less common.

Or ""YEARN"", but N absent and R absent.

Bad.

""HEART"" – H-E-A-R-T, but R absent.

What about ""STEAL"": S-T-E-A-L – positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, A-4, L-5.

A is in position 4 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).

B, L, D are untested.

""ABLED"" is a valid word.

"" ""AMBER"" – A-1,M-2,B-3,E-4,R-4? E-4, but R absent.

""SHAPE"" – S-1,H-2,A-3,P-4,E-5 – A in position 3, E in 5, worse.

So between ""STEAL"" and ""ABLED"", I prefer ""STEAL"" because it has common letters like S and T, which might yield more information.

""STEAL"" puts E in the middle.

However, alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" are also strong. \n\nBetween these, ""CRANE"" is a solid choice:\n- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).\n- All letters are distinct.\n- It has been statistically shown to cover a wide range of possible words.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback efficiently.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: not in the word (x)\n- A: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- N: not in the word (x)\n- E: in the word but wrong position (-)\n\nSo, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.\n\nKey information:\n- Letters present: A and E (each appearing at least once, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""crane"")\n- Letters absent: C, R, N\n\nSince ""crane"" has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, the A cannot be in the 3rd position of the secret word, and E cannot be in the 5th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need to choose a valid 5-letter word that includes A and E, and excludes C, R, N.\n- Ideally, I should test other common letters not yet tried to get more information.\n- Letters not yet tested include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon vowels to cover: O, I, U might be good, but since A and E are already present, perhaps focus on consonants.\n\nPossible letters to consider: S, T, L, D, etc., as they appear frequently.\n\nI want to place A and E in new positions since they can\'t be in position 3 or 5 respectively from the previous guess.\n\nFor example:\n- A was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.\n- E was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI should avoid putting A in position 3 or E in position 5.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of words containing A and E.\n\nA good candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""LEAST"", but ""slate"" has S, L, A, T, E – and we haven\'t tested S, L, or T yet.\n\nHowever, ""slate"" has E in the 5th position, which we know can\'t be correct from feedback (since E got \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 5th position, so placing E at the end again might not be optimal).\n\nIn ""crane"", E was guessed in position 5 and it\'s not correct, so in ""slate"", E is also in position 5, so it might get the same feedback for E.\n\nI should try a word where E is not in position 5.\n\nFor instance, place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s think: since A cannot be in position 3, I need to place it elsewhere.\n\nPossible positions:\n- A can be in 1, 2, or 4\n- E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4\n\nMoreover, I want to test new letters.\n\nOne common starting word after feedback like this is to use ""ALIEN"" or something, but we know that C, R, N are absent, so ""alien"" uses A and E, but has L and I, which are untested.\n\n""Alien"":\n- A in position 1 (which is a possible spot for A)\n- L in position 2\n- I in position 3\n- E in position 4 (not position 5, good)\n- N in position 5 – but N is absent!

But E in 5 – we want to avoid E in position 5 because it\'s wrong (E was in 5 and got \'-\', meaning E is not in that position).\n\n""ALIVE"" has E in position 5, same as before.\n\nBetter to have E not in 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words with E not at the end.\n\nExamples: ""TABLE"" but that has E at the end again. ""TALES"", E in position 5? ""Tales"" is T-A-L-E-S, E in 4? Position: T-1, A-2, L-3, E-4, S-5. ""TALES"" has E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""TARES"" but R is absent.\n\nSince R is absent, avoid TARES.\n\nPossible words: ""SAUTE"" – S-A-U-T-E, E in position 5 not good.\n\n""SHADE"" – S-H-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.\n\nI need a word with E not in position 5 and A not in position 3.\n\nCommon word: ""PSALM"" but no E.\n\n""PLANE"" – P-L-A-N-E, but N is absent so not good.\n\n""SPADE"" – S-P-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.\n\n""LATER"" – L-A-T-E-R, but R is absent so not good.\n\n""DATE"" is only 4 letters.\n\n""OVATE"" – O-V-A-T-E, E in 5.\n\nPerhaps I should accept E in position 5 for now to test other letters, but it might be inefficient since we know E is not there.\n\nFrom feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5, so guessing E in position 5 again would give \'-\' for E, not adding new position information.\n\nSimilarly for A.\n\nTo maximize info, I should guess A in a different position and E in a different position.\n\nA was in position 3, so try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nE was in position 5, so try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIdea: place A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.\n\nWords like ""ABUSE"": A-B-U-S-E – A in 1, E in 5 not good. E in position 5.\n\n""ADIEU"": A-D-I-E-U – E in position 4? Positions: A-1, D-2, I-3, E-4, U-5. So E is in position 4.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a valid word and commonly used in Wordle.\n\nIt has A in position 1 (new position for A) and E in position 4 (new for E).\n\nAlso, letters D, I, U are untested.\n\nBut U is less common; maybe there are better choices.\n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"" but E in 5.\n\n""ALIKE"" – A-L-I-K-E, E in 5.\n\n""AMUSE"" – A-M-U-S-E, E in 5.\n\nHow about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E, E in 5.\n\nI think I might need to accept E in position 4 or another middle position.\n\n""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position 3 for A was already incorrect? No, A can be in other spots.\n\nIn ""DEALT"": D-1,E-2,A-3,L-4,T-5.\n\nA is in position 3 again. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong position. From feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, putting A in position 3 again would not be correct and will give \'-\' again, which doesn\'t help distinguish the position.\n\nSimilarly, for E in position 5, if I guess it again, it would be \'-\'.\n\nTo get new information, I should avoid placing A in position 3 or E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, for ""DEALT"", A is in position 3, which is bad to guess again.\n\nSimilarly, ""LATTE"" has A in position 2, E in position 5 – E in 5 not good.\n\n""LEAST"": L-E-A-S-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position: L-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.\n\nA is in position 3, which should be avoided.\n\nIf I can find a word with A not in 3 and E not in 5.\n\nWhat about ""STARE""? S-T-A-R-E, but R is absent, so not good.\n\n""TEAMS"": T-E-A-M-S – E in position 1? T-1? Position: T-1, E-2, A-3, M-4, S-5.\n\nA is in position 3, which is bad.\n\nHow to rearrange?\n\nI need to put A in position 2 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E – A in position 2, E in position 5.\n\nBetter A in position 2, but E still in 5.\n\n""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, same issue.\n\n""SALAD"" no E.\n\n""BEAST"": B-E-A-S-T – E in position 1? Positions: B-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.\n\nA in position 3 again.\n\nI\'m struggling.\n\nLet\'s list positions: let position 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nA can be in 1,2,4.\n\nE can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, the secret word has exactly these letters: A and E are present.\n\nNow, possible word: ""WEARY"" but has W and Y, less common.\n\nOr ""YEARN"", but N absent and R absent.\n\nBad.\n\n""HEART"" – H-E-A-R-T, but R absent.\n\nWhat about ""STEAL"": S-T-E-A-L – positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, A-4, L-5.\n\nA is in position 4 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).\n\nAnd letters S,T,L are not tested.\n\n""STEAL"" seems good:\n- S not tested\n- T not tested\n- E in position 3 (was not guessed in position 3 before; previously E was in position 5)\n- A in position 4 (previously in position 3)\n- L not tested\n\nAlso, not using forbidden letters.\n\nValid word.\n\nTo maximize common letters, but I think ""STEAL"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""SLATE"" , but ""slate"": S-1, L-2, A-3, T-4, E-5 – A in position 3 which is bad, E in position 5 which is bad. Avoid.\n\n""PEACH"" no E at the end, but C is absent, not good.\n\nSo ""STEAL"" might be a good choice.\n\nOr ""STELA"" – same as STEAL, variant spelling.\n\nBut STEAL is common.\n\n""DREAM"" – D-R-E-A-M, but R absent.\n\nNot good.\n\n""ALONE"" – A-1, L-2, O-3, N-4, E-5 – but N absent, and E in 5.\n\nNot good.\n\n""ABLED"" – A-1, B-2, L-3, E-4, D-5 – E in position 4, A in position 1.\n\nThis could work: A not in 3, E not in 5.\n\nLetters: B,L,E,D.\n\nB, L, D are untested.\n\n""ABLED"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""AGILE"" has G,I,L,E – A-1,G-2,I-3,L-4,E-5 – E in 5 not good.\n\n"" ""AMBER"" – A-1,M-2,B-3,E-4,R-4? E-4, but R absent.\n\nNot good.\n\n""SHAPE"" – S-1,H-2,A-3,P-4,E-5 – A in position 3, E in 5, worse.\n\nSo between ""STEAL"" and ""ABLED"", I prefer ""STEAL"" because it has common letters like S and T, which might yield more information.\n\n""STEAL"" puts E in the middle.\n\nI think ""STEAL"" is fine.\n\nPerhaps ""AUDIO"" but no E, and we know E is present, but I can guess it to test vowels, but I already know A and E are present, so I should include both to confirm positions.\n\nI think including A and E is better.\n\nAnother word: ""OCEAN"" but C absent and N absent.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".<thought>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: absent (x) → not in the word\n- R: absent (x) → not in the word\n- A: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect)\n- N: absent (x) → not in the word\n- E: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect)\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word contains A and E.\n- Excludes C, R, N.\n- A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and E to gather position information.\n- Avoid positions where A and E are already known to be incorrect: A not in position 3, E not in position 5.\n- Avoid using C, R, or N.\n- Test new common letters to gain more coverage (e.g., S, T, L).\n\nChose ""STEAL"" as the guess:\n- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), A (4), L (5)\n  - E is placed in position 3 (new position, not tested before).\n  - A is placed in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 3 from previous guess).\n- Uses untested letters S, T, L.\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n- Maximizes information potential by testing frequent consonants and rearranging A and E positions.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) E(-) A(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: ""steal"" → Feedback: S(x) T(-) E(-) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
- S and L are not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-'). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5, now we know it's also not in position 3.
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, A is in position 4 (because in ""steal"", A was in position 4 and we got a ✓).

So combining all information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - A is in position 4.

2. Present letters but incorrect positions:
   - E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Also, we know from Guess 1 that E is present, and now we have more information about its position.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have A in position 4: _ _ A _ _
- Contains E and T, but E cannot be in position 3 or 5, and T cannot be in position 2.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, S, L.

Now, since A is fixed at position 4, we need to find positions for E and T and three other letters (but total 5 letters).

We also know E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4? Wait, position 4 is taken by A, so E cannot be in position 4? Position 4 is A, so E can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since we know it's not in 3 or 5).

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 2, so T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1, 3, or 5.

The word must have exactly 5 letters. Let's denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5, with P4 = A.

We have:
- E must be in P1 or P2 (the only positions left that are allowed for E).
- T must be in P1, P3, or P5.

Additionally, we must include other letters, avoiding C,R,N,S,L.

Now, for our next guess, we need to try to test possible positions for E and T and cover other frequent letters.

We might try to place E in position 1 or 2 and T in one of the allowed positions.

Since E must be in position 1 or 2, let's think of words that have A in position 4 and include E and T.

Common letters left: we have tested C,R,N,S,L and found absent. So we have letters like B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z left.

But we should prefer common letters.

Possible words:

First, if E is in position 1: E _ _ A _
Then, T could be in position 3 or 5? For example: E _ T A _

What could the second letter be? And the last letter.

Similarly, if E is in position 2: _ E _ A _

We also need to avoid S, L, R, C, N.

Let me try to think of words with pattern:

Option 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5. And T must be in 3 or 5.

Also, the word must contain T.

Examples: 
- E _ T A _ -> e.g., E X T A ? but let's find words.

""EXTRA"" has R and S? R is absent, not good.
""EYOTA"" not a word.
""EIGHT"" but no A? A is at 4? ""eighth"" is 6 letters. Not a 5-letter word.

Better: ""ENATE"" but N is absent? N was already ruled out.

We need to avoid R,N,S,L,C.

Possible: ""EPHAS"" not word.

Another: ""EDGAR"" but R absent and G? Not working.

""EJECT"" but C absent.

Not easy.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

Then T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: 
- T E _ A _ -> e.g., TEAA? no.

""TEARY"" but R is absent.
""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEATS"" has T at 1 and 4? But position 4 is A, not T. Also S absent.

""DEALT"" has T, but L absent and A is at position 3? But we need A at 4? ""DEALT"" is D-E-A-L-T, positions: D1,E2,A3,L4,T5. But we need A at position 4, not 3.

We must have A at position 4.

So patterns: _ E _ A _

Words with E in position 2 and A in position 4:

Possible: LETTER? but two T? L absent.

""METAL"": M1,E2,T3,A4,L5 -> but L is absent, cannot use.

""BETAS"" but S absent.

""PETAL"" L absent.

We avoid L.

Perhaps ""HEFT A""? H E F T A? ""HEFTA"" not a word.

It's challenging. Maybe I should list words that have A as the fourth letter and contain E.

For example: 
- __ E A _ ? No, A is at 4, so before A is position 3.

Position: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

So words: ? + E + ? + A + ?

Example: ""BEANS"" but S and N absent.
""WEARY"" R absent and Y?
""LEGAL"" L absent and G? But L absent.
""VEGAN"" N absent.
""HEIST"" no A.

With E in position 1: E + ? + ? + A + ?

Words: ""EAGLE"" but L absent and G? E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? But A must be at 4, not 2? Wrong pattern.

No: for E in position 1 and A in position 4: E ? ? A ?

Example: ""EPOXY"" no A.
""EQUIP"" no A.
""ERASE"" R and S absent.
""EXILE"" L absent.

Perhaps it's better to allow for the possibility of E not being in position 1 or 2? But from feedback, E must be in position 1 or 2 because we've ruled out 3 and 5, and position 4 is A.

Position 4 is A, so E cannot be in position 4 because one position cannot have two letters.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.

Similarly, T in 1,3,5.

Now, another common letter is I or O or U.

We might try a word that places E in position 2 and T in position 5, for example.

Pattern: _ E _ A T

Then position 1 and 3 need letters.

Words: 
- M E ? A T -> ""MEBAT"" no.
""DEFAT"" D E F A T? ""defat"" is a word? Yes, meaning to remove fat.
- But letters: D1,E2,F3,A4,T5 -> D and F are untested.

But ""defat"" might not be very common.

Other: ""DEMAT"" similar.
""REHAT"" but R absent.

Since R is absent, not.

""BEVAT"" not word.

""HEPAT"" not common.

""DEPOT"" no A.

Not good.

Pattern with E in position 1: E ? ? A ?

And T in position 3: E ? T A ?

Then positions 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: E _ T A _

""EIGHTA"" no.
""BETAS"" S absent.
"" ZETAS"" S absent.
""EAT A"" but too short.

""METAL"" L absent.

""HETAS"" ? not word.

Perhaps ""EGYPT"" no A.

Idea: ""ENTIA"" but N and T? N absent.

Not.

Since A is fixed at position 4, and E must be in 1 or 2, and T in 1,3,5 (but if E is in 1, then T might be in 3 or 5).

Also, we know that in the first guess, E was in position 5 and was present but wrong, so if we put it at position 1 or 2, we might get new feedback.

But what words?

Let's think of common words: ""TABLE"" but A not at 4.
""BEACH"" C absent.

Another word: ""HEART"" R absent.

""PEACH"" C absent.

""OAKEN"" N and K? E? ""Oaken"" is O1,A2,K3,E4,N5? But A must be at position 4? No, we have A at position 4.

""Oaken"" has A at position 2.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? Then A is at position 5, not 4. Not.

""PIZZA"" A at 5.

""LLAMA"" A at 4 and 5, but L absent.

"" data = ['.....'] ""

Perhaps ""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? But N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? Oh, ""MEDIA"": positions 1:M, 2:E, 3:D, 4:I, 5:A? Not A at 4.

We need A at position 4.

For example, ""OPT A"" no.

""OPTICAL"" too long.

""LOCAL"" L absent.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Common words with A in position 4:

Examples: 
- BOCCA? not English.
- COCKA?no.
- DELTA: D1,E2,L3,T4,A5 -> but L absent, and A at 5.
- DELTA:A at 5.

Other: ""FIRMA"" F1,I2,R3,M4,A5-> R absent.
""VISTA"" V1, I2, S3, T4, A5 -> S absent, and A at 5.
""VISTA"" has A at 5, not 4.

""TIARA"" T1,I2,A3,A4,R5? A at position 3 and 4? But we need A only at 4, and dual letter. Also R absent.

Not easy.

""ASIA"" is 4 letters.

O, ""KAPUT"" but U? A at position 2.

Perhaps ""ABACU"" no.

Let's search: words ending with vowel. But many have A at the end.

For example, ""EXTRA"" has A at the end, position 5.

But we need A at position 4.

So the word must have a letter after A, so position 5 must have a consonant usually.

For example, ""MANGA"" M1,A2,N3,G4,A5? A at 2 and 5.

""TANGA"" same.

""  ""F j  "" but not.

""ALGAE"" have A at position 1 and 4? ""ALGAE"": A1,L2,G3,A4,E5.

Ah, ""ALGAE"": A1 (position 1), L2, G3, A4, E5.

But L is absent! S,L,R,C,N are absent, so L cannot be used.

In ""ALGAE"", L is used, which is absent.

Similarly, ""ARE AE"" no.

""BAZAR"" R and Z? R absent.

No.

Perhaps ""UDDER"" no A.

I need to reconsider the position.

Another idea: maybe E is not in position 1 or 2? But we know it must be in 1 or 2 because position 3 and 5 are invalid, and 4 is A.

So no other choice.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback for duplicate yet.

For example, if A appears twice? But in ""crane"" we had one A and it was not at 3, and in ""steal"" we have A at 4 correct.

If there is another A, it might be present, but feedback didn't show any additional A.

In ""crane"" we had only one A, which was -, and in ""steal"", we had one A at 4 which was correct, so probably only one A.

Similarly for E.

So let's try to find words with E in position 1 or 2, A in position 4, and including T.

And avoid C,R,N,S,L.

List of possible words:

1. E in position 1:

Pattern: E _ _ A _

Fill position 2,3,5.

Position 3 must be a consonant, etc.

Possible words: ""EDGAR"" not, R absent.
""EBOOK"" no A.
""  ""EBOLA"" B1,? E1,B2,O3,L4,A5? But L absent.
""ECHOS"" no A.
""EDUCE"" no A.
""EFF A"" no.
""EGRET"" G? R absent.
""EJECT"" C absent.
""ELFIN"" N and L absent.
""ELUTE"" L absent.
""EMAIL"" L absent.
""EPHAH"" H? ""ephah"" is E P H A H, positions: E1,P2,H3,A4,H5? Ah, A at position 4! ""EPHAH"" E1,P2,H3,A4,H5.

Valid word? EPH is a unit of measure.

Uses P and H, which are not tested.

Absent letters: avoids C,R,N,S,L? Yes.

But is it common? Not very, but valid.

Another: ""EPHOR"" but no A.

""EPHAS"" not word.

""EPHAH"" might be acceptable.

Other words: ""ETWAs"" no.

""EX eat"" no.

""EXIST"" S absent.

""EX a"" no.

So ""EPHAH"" is a possibility.

2. E in position 2:

Pattern: _ E _ A _

Position 1,3,5.

T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: ""BE a_"" not.

""UELLA"" not.

""ME a_"" not.

""WEIGHT"" no.

""le an"" not.

""DE AIR"" not 5 letter.

""DEATH"" D E A T H? PositionsD1,E2,A3,T4,H5? But we need A at position 4? Here A is at position 3, not 4.

Mismatch.

""HEART"" H E A R T, A at 3, not 4.

GENERAL not 5.

""TEETH"" T E E T H, no A.

""PE AT"" not.

""REACT"" R absent C absent.

""TEACH"" C absent.

""MEADOW"" too long.

""CHEAP"" C absent.

""WEARY"" R absent.

"" heavy"" e at 2, but A? ""HEAVY"" H E A V Y, A at position 3.

Not at 4.

""BEADY"" B E A D Y, A at 3.

Same.

""LEADY"" L and A at 3.

Absent L.

""REAPS"" R and S absent.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps a word like ""OLEUM"" no A.

Or ""UBOAT"" no.

Another word: ""UPE at"" no.

""   ""  Let's think of ""ADIEU"" but A at 1, not 2.

Or I recall ""OCREA"" not common.

Perhaps ""AGORA"" but A at 1 and 4? ""AGORA"": A1,G2,O3,R4,A5? R absent, and A at position 1 and 5, not 4 only.

Not.

"" data word: ""ANIMA"" not.

Perhaps I should consider guessing a word with the pattern and common letters.

Since T is present but not at position 2, and we have few information, we can try to place T in position 3 or 5.

For example, with E in position 2: # E # A #

And T in position 5: then pattern _ E _ A T

Words that end with ""AT"": but it's ""E A T"", so like ""x E y A T"" but A at 4, so position 3 is something.

Position 1,2,3,4,5: (1) (E) (?) (A) (T)

So "" E ? A T""

For example, ""LEGAT"" L E G A T? But L absent.

""REBAT"" not word.
""  ""HEPAT"" not common.
""DEPOT"" not.
""DEMAT"" D E M A T? ""demat"" is not common but might be accepted? Meaning to remove material.
But letter M.

""fiat"" is 4 letters.

""VIAT U"" no.

""PIETA"" P I E T A? Positions P1,I2,E3,T4,A5? But E is at position 3? But we have feedback that E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" guess.

In ""steal"", E was in position 3 and we got E(-), meaning E is not in position 3.

Also, in this ""PIETA"" has E in position 3, which is not allowed.

Similarly, for other positions.

So back to ""EPHAH"" or other words.

Another word: ""ETHAL"" L absent.

Or ""EK a"" no.

Perhaps ""ODEUM"" no A.

I think I found one: ""BEVAN"" but N absent.

No.

""HEJRA"" R absent and J? Not.

""HEPAR"" R absent.

""KEDGE"" no A.

Perhaps ""METAL"" is out, but ""METAD"" ? not word.

""  "" let's accept ""EPHAH"" as a guess.

But it may not be efficient.

Another idea: maybe T is in position 1.

With E in position 2: pattern T E _ A _

Then position 3 and 5 to fill.

Words: T E ? A ?

Examples: ""TE a_"" like ""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEary"" R absent.
""TEADE"" not word.
""TEMPI"" no A.
""TENDU"" N absent.
""TEPAL"" L absent.
""TEUCH"" not.

""TEETH"" no A.

""TETRA"" R absent.

""TEWEL"" L absent.

""THEMA"" H? T H E M A, positions T1,H2,E3,M4,A5? Then E is at position 3, which is not allowed! We know E not in position 3.

In this pattern, E is in position 2, which is good.

""THEMA"" has T1,H2,E3,M4,A5 -> E at position 3, which is invalid position for E.

Similarly, ""TELLA"" T E L L A, L absent.

Not.

""TEEDA"" not word.

It's difficult, so I'll go with ""EPHAH"" for the guess.

But let's try E in position 1 and T in position 5: E _ _ A T

Pattern: E ? ? A T

Words: ""ELIAT"" not word.
""ENIAT"" not.
""EPPAT"" not.
""ERAAT"" not.
""ERYAT"" not.
""EVENT"" no A.
""EXEAT"" X? ""exeat"" is a word, meaning permission. Letters E1,X2,E3,A4,T5. E at position 1 and 3? That could be, because the letter E might be duplicated.

""EXEAT"" has two E's.

Feedback in ""crane"" had E at position 5 which was '-' -> so E is present, but not at position 5. Could be at other positions.

In ""steal"", E at position 3 was '-', so E is not at position 3.

But ""EXEAT"" has E at position 1 and 3.

Position 3 E might be the same as position 1 or a different occurrence.

Feedback would show for each:

In ""EXEAT"", if secret word has only one E, then the position 3 E might be marked 'x' if the secret has only one and it's at position 1.

If the secret has two E's, then position 1 E get '✓' or '-', etc.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

For ""EXEAT"" guess:
- Position 1: E: if secret word has E at 1, it's '✓', else if E present but not 1, ' -', else 'x'.
- Position 3: E: similarly.

But we know there is at least one E.

Also, we have E at position 3 being checked, but from previous feedback, we know position 3 is not correct for E, so for a new guess with E at position 3, it would likely be '-' or 'x', not '✓'.

But in this case, since we have a known E at other position, it might be marked with '-' if the secret has another E, or 'x' if not.

This could give information, but it's complicated.

Moreover, ""EXEAT"" uses X, which is infrequent.

Similarly, not ideal.

Another word: ""EGGAR"" G and R? R absent.

Not.

So, let's rethink.

Perhaps we forgot some common words.

""PIZZA"" A at 4? P1,I2,Z3,Z4,A5? A at position 5.

Not.

""JUMBA"" J? U? M? A at 3? J1,U2,M3,B4,A5? A at 5.

Not.

"" data = ["" words with A at position 4.

for example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? R absent.

""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? A at 5.

Oh,, many words have A at position 5.

Others: ""YEAST"" S absent.

""FEAST"" S absent.

"" BEAST S absent.

But we might need to consider that position 5 is open.

Another word: ""ORATE"" O1,R2,A3,T4,E5? R absent, and A at position 3.

But we know A must be at position 4.

Perhaps ""STATE"" S absent.

I think I have to choose ""EPHAH"" or similar.

Perhaps ""EIGHT"" is not, but "" high a"" no.

Let's consider the word ""CHAIN"" C absent.

Or ""THAIN"" H and T? ""THAIN"" T1,H2,A3,I4,N5? N absent, and A at position 3, not 4.

Not.

The word ""PATIO"" P1,A2,T3,I4,O5? A at 2.

Not.

""AMPLY"" A at 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""adobe"" A1,d2,o3, B4, E5? Then A at 1 and E at 5, but position 5 for E is invalid.

 not.

I recall the word ""OCTAD"" but no E.

The word ""EERIE"" no A.

We may need to output a guess even if not perfect.

Perhaps ""ADOBE"" for other reasons.

Another idea: from the feedback, we have T present but not at 2, E present not at 3 or 5, A at 4.

So for our next guess, we can try to place E at position 1 and T at position 3, for example.

Pattern: E _ T A _

Then position 2 and 5 need letters.

Words: E ? T A ?

Examples: ""EAT A"" missing letter.

""B taken"" not.

"" ECTAD"" C absent.

""EDIT A"" too long.
""EDITE"" no A.

""ELT a"" no.

""EMT a"" not word.

""ENTAD"" N absent.

""EPTAK"" not.

 a valid word: ""pieta"" as before but E in position 3.

 not.

""WHEAT"" W H E A T? But E at position 3, which is invalid ( not allowed).

Positions: W1,H2,E3,A4,T5. Then we would have E in position 3, but we know E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" feedback.

Also, A at position 4, which is good.

But E at position 3 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""TREAT"" T1,R2,E3,A4,T5? R absent, and E at 3 prohibited.

So cannot use.

The only reasonable choice I see is to guess a word like ""EPHAH"" or for E in position 2, a word like ""DEVOT"" no.

Perhaps ""ABATE"" A1,B2,A3,T4,E5? But A at 3? Position 3 is the third letter.

""ABATE"": A1,B2,A3,T4,E5.

But we need A at position 4? Here T is at 4, A at 1 and 3.

Not.

Moreover, E at position 5 is prohibited.

So not good.

Let's choose ""EPHAH"" as it fits the pattern: E P H A H

We can test it.

Or better, a more common word.

Another word: ""EYRIR"" not English.

""  "" I settle for ""EPHAH"".

Or ""EKKas"" no.

Perhaps the word ""EARTH"" R absent.

I think I found one: ""BEATH"" is not common, but ""ME ath"" no.

"" itead"" no.

I think we should guess ""DEPOT"" but no A.

Consider not including A, but we know A is at position 4, so we can keep A there and guess.

For the next guess, we can keep A in position 4 and change other letters.

Pattern: _ . . A .

With E in position 1 or 2, and T somewhere.

Spray with common letters.

For example, with E in position 2: "" E . A .""

With common letters: ""BET A"" not.
"" SET A"" S absent.

""GET A"" G E T A ? then position 3 and 5, but for ""GET A"", it's 4 letters.

""MET A"" M E T A ? then position 3? ""META"" is 4 letters.

""PETA"" short.

""VET a"" short.

Try ""META L"" not.

Perhaps ""HEALD"" L absent.

I think I need to go with a word like ""ETHIC"" no A.

But we must include A and E.

Perhaps I missed the word ""OVATE"": O1,V2,A3,T4,E5? But A at position 3, not 4; and E at 5 prohibited.

Not.

""STAVE"" S absent and A in 3 not.

No.

Another: ""DIODE"" no A.

""FERIA"" F1,E2,R3,I4,A5? R absent, and A at 5.

But position 5 for A? But our A is at position 4.

So for this guess, if we put A at position 4, but in ""FERIA"" it's at 5, so different.

We must keep A at position 4.

Therefore, I decide to guess ""EPHAH"".
</think>
<thought>
Given the feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- Guess 2: ""steal"" → S(x), T(-), E(-), A(✓), L(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and L are absent.  
  - T is present but not in position 2.  
  - E is present but not in position 3 (and also not in position 5 as per Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed in position 4 (i.e., the secret word has A as the fourth letter).

Key deductions:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.
- A is fixed in position 4: the secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`.
- E must be present and can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are eliminated, and position 4 is occupied by A).
- T must be present and can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is eliminated).
- No new information about other letters, so we aim to test common unused letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U) while confirming positions for E and T.

For the next guess:
- Must include E in position 1 or 2 and T in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must keep A in position 4.
- Avoid C, R, N, S, L.
- Prioritize testing E and T positions and high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Choosing a valid word:
- After evaluating options, ""EPHAH"" fits:  
  - E in position 1 (tests E not in position 2 yet).  
  - T is not included here, but we know it must be placed in future guesses; this focuses on E's position and tests new letters.  
  - A is in position 4.  
  - Uses untested letters: P, H (avoiding absent letters).  
  - If E isn't in position 1, we'll get feedback to confirm position 2 for E.
- Other considered words like ""EXEAT"" or ""OCTAD"" were invalid due to absent letters or incorrect patterns. ""EPHAH"" is a valid (though uncommon) English word meaning a Hebrew unit of measurement.
</thought>

<guess>ephah</guess>",ephah,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, N are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: ""steal"" → Feedback: S(x) T(-) E(-) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
- S and L are not in the word at all.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (since we got '-'). Also, we already knew E is not in position 5, now we know it's also not in position 3.
- A is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, A is in position 4 (because in ""steal"", A was in position 4 and we got a ✓).

So combining all information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - A is in position 4.

2. Present letters but incorrect positions:
   - E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Also, we know from Guess 1 that E is present, and now we have more information about its position.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have A in position 4: _ _ A _ _
- Contains E and T, but E cannot be in position 3 or 5, and T cannot be in position 2.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, S, L.

Now, since A is fixed at position 4, we need to find positions for E and T and three other letters (but total 5 letters).

We also know E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4? Wait, position 4 is taken by A, so E cannot be in position 4? Position 4 is A, so E can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since we know it's not in 3 or 5).

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 2, so T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1, 3, or 5.

The word must have exactly 5 letters. Let's denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5, with P4 = A.

We have:
- E must be in P1 or P2 (the only positions left that are allowed for E).
- T must be in P1, P3, or P5.

Additionally, we must include other letters, avoiding C,R,N,S,L.

Now, for our next guess, we need to try to test possible positions for E and T and cover other frequent letters.

We might try to place E in position 1 or 2 and T in one of the allowed positions.

Since E must be in position 1 or 2, let's think of words that have A in position 4 and include E and T.

Common letters left: we have tested C,R,N,S,L and found absent. So we have letters like B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z left.

But we should prefer common letters.

Possible words:

First, if E is in position 1: E _ _ A _
Then, T could be in position 3 or 5? For example: E _ T A _

What could the second letter be? And the last letter.

Similarly, if E is in position 2: _ E _ A _

We also need to avoid S, L, R, C, N.

Let me try to think of words with pattern:

Option 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5. And T must be in 3 or 5.

Also, the word must contain T.

Examples: 
- E _ T A _ -> e.g., E X T A ? but let's find words.

""EXTRA"" has R and S? R is absent, not good.
""EYOTA"" not a word.
""EIGHT"" but no A? A is at 4? ""eighth"" is 6 letters. Not a 5-letter word.

Better: ""ENATE"" but N is absent? N was already ruled out.

We need to avoid R,N,S,L,C.

Possible: ""EPHAS"" not word.

Another: ""EDGAR"" but R absent and G? Not working.

""EJECT"" but C absent.

Not easy.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

Then T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: 
- T E _ A _ -> e.g., TEAA? no.

""TEARY"" but R is absent.
""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEATS"" has T at 1 and 4? But position 4 is A, not T. Also S absent.

""DEALT"" has T, but L absent and A is at position 3? But we need A at 4? ""DEALT"" is D-E-A-L-T, positions: D1,E2,A3,L4,T5. But we need A at position 4, not 3.

We must have A at position 4.

So patterns: _ E _ A _

Words with E in position 2 and A in position 4:

Possible: LETTER? but two T? L absent.

""METAL"": M1,E2,T3,A4,L5 -> but L is absent, cannot use.

""BETAS"" but S absent.

""PETAL"" L absent.

We avoid L.

Perhaps ""HEFT A""? H E F T A? ""HEFTA"" not a word.

It's challenging. Maybe I should list words that have A as the fourth letter and contain E.

For example: 
- __ E A _ ? No, A is at 4, so before A is position 3.

Position: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

So words: ? + E + ? + A + ?

Example: ""BEANS"" but S and N absent.
""WEARY"" R absent and Y?
""LEGAL"" L absent and G? But L absent.
""VEGAN"" N absent.
""HEIST"" no A.

With E in position 1: E + ? + ? + A + ?

Words: ""EAGLE"" but L absent and G? E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? But A must be at 4, not 2? Wrong pattern.

No: for E in position 1 and A in position 4: E ? ? A ?

Example: ""EPOXY"" no A.
""EQUIP"" no A.
""ERASE"" R and S absent.
""EXILE"" L absent.

Perhaps it's better to allow for the possibility of E not being in position 1 or 2? But from feedback, E must be in position 1 or 2 because we've ruled out 3 and 5, and position 4 is A.

Position 4 is A, so E cannot be in position 4 because one position cannot have two letters.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.

Similarly, T in 1,3,5.

Now, another common letter is I or O or U.

We might try a word that places E in position 2 and T in position 5, for example.

Pattern: _ E _ A T

Then position 1 and 3 need letters.

Words: 
- M E ? A T -> ""MEBAT"" no.
""DEFAT"" D E F A T? ""defat"" is a word? Yes, meaning to remove fat.
- But letters: D1,E2,F3,A4,T5 -> D and F are untested.

But ""defat"" might not be very common.

Other: ""DEMAT"" similar.
""REHAT"" but R absent.

Since R is absent, not.

""BEVAT"" not word.

""HEPAT"" not common.

""DEPOT"" no A.

Not good.

Pattern with E in position 1: E ? ? A ?

And T in position 3: E ? T A ?

Then positions 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: E _ T A _

""EIGHTA"" no.
""BETAS"" S absent.
"" ZETAS"" S absent.
""EAT A"" but too short.

""METAL"" L absent.

""HETAS"" ? not word.

Perhaps ""EGYPT"" no A.

Idea: ""ENTIA"" but N and T? N absent.

Not.

Since A is fixed at position 4, and E must be in 1 or 2, and T in 1,3,5 (but if E is in 1, then T might be in 3 or 5).

Also, we know that in the first guess, E was in position 5 and was present but wrong, so if we put it at position 1 or 2, we might get new feedback.

But what words?

Let's think of common words: ""TABLE"" but A not at 4.
""BEACH"" C absent.

Another word: ""HEART"" R absent.

""PEACH"" C absent.

""OAKEN"" N and K? E? ""Oaken"" is O1,A2,K3,E4,N5? But A must be at position 4? No, we have A at position 4.

""Oaken"" has A at position 2.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? Then A is at position 5, not 4. Not.

""PIZZA"" A at 5.

""LLAMA"" A at 4 and 5, but L absent.

"" data = ['.....'] ""

Perhaps ""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? But N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? Oh, ""MEDIA"": positions 1:M, 2:E, 3:D, 4:I, 5:A? Not A at 4.

We need A at position 4.

For example, ""OPT A"" no.

""OPTICAL"" too long.

""LOCAL"" L absent.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Common words with A in position 4:

Examples: 
- BOCCA? not English.
- COCKA?no.
- DELTA: D1,E2,L3,T4,A5 -> but L absent, and A at 5.
- DELTA:A at 5.

Other: ""FIRMA"" F1,I2,R3,M4,A5-> R absent.
""VISTA"" V1, I2, S3, T4, A5 -> S absent, and A at 5.
""VISTA"" has A at 5, not 4.

""TIARA"" T1,I2,A3,A4,R5? A at position 3 and 4? But we need A only at 4, and dual letter. Also R absent.

Not easy.

""ASIA"" is 4 letters.

O, ""KAPUT"" but U? A at position 2.

Perhaps ""ABACU"" no.

Let's search: words ending with vowel. But many have A at the end.

For example, ""EXTRA"" has A at the end, position 5.

But we need A at position 4.

So the word must have a letter after A, so position 5 must have a consonant usually.

For example, ""MANGA"" M1,A2,N3,G4,A5? A at 2 and 5.

""TANGA"" same.

""  ""F j  "" but not.

""ALGAE"" have A at position 1 and 4? ""ALGAE"": A1,L2,G3,A4,E5.

Ah, ""ALGAE"": A1 (position 1), L2, G3, A4, E5.

But L is absent! S,L,R,C,N are absent, so L cannot be used.

In ""ALGAE"", L is used, which is absent.

Similarly, ""ARE AE"" no.

""BAZAR"" R and Z? R absent.

No.

Perhaps ""UDDER"" no A.

I need to reconsider the position.

Another idea: maybe E is not in position 1 or 2? But we know it must be in 1 or 2 because position 3 and 5 are invalid, and 4 is A.

So no other choice.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback for duplicate yet.

For example, if A appears twice? But in ""crane"" we had one A and it was not at 3, and in ""steal"" we have A at 4 correct.

If there is another A, it might be present, but feedback didn't show any additional A.

In ""crane"" we had only one A, which was -, and in ""steal"", we had one A at 4 which was correct, so probably only one A.

Similarly for E.

So let's try to find words with E in position 1 or 2, A in position 4, and including T.

And avoid C,R,N,S,L.

List of possible words:

1. E in position 1:

Pattern: E _ _ A _

Fill position 2,3,5.

Position 3 must be a consonant, etc.

Possible words: ""EDGAR"" not, R absent.
""EBOOK"" no A.
""  ""EBOLA"" B1,? E1,B2,O3,L4,A5? But L absent.
""ECHOS"" no A.
""EDUCE"" no A.
""EFF A"" no.
""EGRET"" G? R absent.
""EJECT"" C absent.
""ELFIN"" N and L absent.
""ELUTE"" L absent.
""EMAIL"" L absent.
""EPHAH"" H? ""ephah"" is E P H A H, positions: E1,P2,H3,A4,H5? Ah, A at position 4! ""EPHAH"" E1,P2,H3,A4,H5.

Valid word? EPH is a unit of measure.

Uses P and H, which are not tested.

Absent letters: avoids C,R,N,S,L? Yes.

But is it common? Not very, but valid.

Another: ""EPHOR"" but no A.

""EPHAS"" not word.

""EPHAH"" might be acceptable.

Other words: ""ETWAs"" no.

""EX eat"" no.

""EXIST"" S absent.

""EX a"" no.

So ""EPHAH"" is a possibility.

2. E in position 2:

Pattern: _ E _ A _

Position 1,3,5.

T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: ""BE a_"" not.

""UELLA"" not.

""ME a_"" not.

""WEIGHT"" no.

""le an"" not.

""DE AIR"" not 5 letter.

""DEATH"" D E A T H? PositionsD1,E2,A3,T4,H5? But we need A at position 4? Here A is at position 3, not 4.

Mismatch.

""HEART"" H E A R T, A at 3, not 4.

GENERAL not 5.

""TEETH"" T E E T H, no A.

""PE AT"" not.

""REACT"" R absent C absent.

""TEACH"" C absent.

""MEADOW"" too long.

""CHEAP"" C absent.

""WEARY"" R absent.

"" heavy"" e at 2, but A? ""HEAVY"" H E A V Y, A at position 3.

Not at 4.

""BEADY"" B E A D Y, A at 3.

Same.

""LEADY"" L and A at 3.

Absent L.

""REAPS"" R and S absent.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps a word like ""OLEUM"" no A.

Or ""UBOAT"" no.

Another word: ""UPE at"" no.

""   ""  Let's think of ""ADIEU"" but A at 1, not 2.

Or I recall ""OCREA"" not common.

Perhaps ""AGORA"" but A at 1 and 4? ""AGORA"": A1,G2,O3,R4,A5? R absent, and A at position 1 and 5, not 4 only.

Not.

"" data word: ""ANIMA"" not.

Perhaps I should consider guessing a word with the pattern and common letters.

Since T is present but not at position 2, and we have few information, we can try to place T in position 3 or 5.

For example, with E in position 2: # E # A #

And T in position 5: then pattern _ E _ A T

Words that end with ""AT"": but it's ""E A T"", so like ""x E y A T"" but A at 4, so position 3 is something.

Position 1,2,3,4,5: (1) (E) (?) (A) (T)

So "" E ? A T""

For example, ""LEGAT"" L E G A T? But L absent.

""REBAT"" not word.
""  ""HEPAT"" not common.
""DEPOT"" not.
""DEMAT"" D E M A T? ""demat"" is not common but might be accepted? Meaning to remove material.
But letter M.

""fiat"" is 4 letters.

""VIAT U"" no.

""PIETA"" P I E T A? Positions P1,I2,E3,T4,A5? But E is at position 3? But we have feedback that E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" guess.

In ""steal"", E was in position 3 and we got E(-), meaning E is not in position 3.

Also, in this ""PIETA"" has E in position 3, which is not allowed.

Similarly, for other positions.

So back to ""EPHAH"" or other words.

Another word: ""ETHAL"" L absent.

Or ""EK a"" no.

Perhaps ""ODEUM"" no A.

I think I found one: ""BEVAN"" but N absent.

No.

""HEJRA"" R absent and J? Not.

""HEPAR"" R absent.

""KEDGE"" no A.

Perhaps ""METAL"" is out, but ""METAD"" ? not word.

""  "" let's accept ""EPHAH"" as a guess.

But it may not be efficient.

Another idea: maybe T is in position 1.

With E in position 2: pattern T E _ A _

Then position 3 and 5 to fill.

Words: T E ? A ?

Examples: ""TE a_"" like ""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEary"" R absent.
""TEADE"" not word.
""TEMPI"" no A.
""TENDU"" N absent.
""TEPAL"" L absent.
""TEUCH"" not.

""TEETH"" no A.

""TETRA"" R absent.

""TEWEL"" L absent.

""THEMA"" H? T H E M A, positions T1,H2,E3,M4,A5? Then E is at position 3, which is not allowed! We know E not in position 3.

In this pattern, E is in position 2, which is good.

""THEMA"" has T1,H2,E3,M4,A5 -> E at position 3, which is invalid position for E.

Similarly, ""TELLA"" T E L L A, L absent.

Not.

""TEEDA"" not word.

It's difficult, so I'll go with ""EPHAH"" for the guess.

But let's try E in position 1 and T in position 5: E _ _ A T

Pattern: E ? ? A T

Words: ""ELIAT"" not word.
""ENIAT"" not.
""EPPAT"" not.
""ERAAT"" not.
""ERYAT"" not.
""EVENT"" no A.
""EXEAT"" X? ""exeat"" is a word, meaning permission. Letters E1,X2,E3,A4,T5. E at position 1 and 3? That could be, because the letter E might be duplicated.

""EXEAT"" has two E's.

Feedback in ""crane"" had E at position 5 which was '-' -> so E is present, but not at position 5. Could be at other positions.

In ""steal"", E at position 3 was '-', so E is not at position 3.

But ""EXEAT"" has E at position 1 and 3.

Position 3 E might be the same as position 1 or a different occurrence.

Feedback would show for each:

In ""EXEAT"", if secret word has only one E, then the position 3 E might be marked 'x' if the secret has only one and it's at position 1.

If the secret has two E's, then position 1 E get '✓' or '-', etc.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

For ""EXEAT"" guess:
- Position 1: E: if secret word has E at 1, it's '✓', else if E present but not 1, ' -', else 'x'.
- Position 3: E: similarly.

But we know there is at least one E.

Also, we have E at position 3 being checked, but from previous feedback, we know position 3 is not correct for E, so for a new guess with E at position 3, it would likely be '-' or 'x', not '✓'.

But in this case, since we have a known E at other position, it might be marked with '-' if the secret has another E, or 'x' if not.

This could give information, but it's complicated.

Moreover, ""EXEAT"" uses X, which is infrequent.

Similarly, not ideal.

Another word: ""EGGAR"" G and R? R absent.

Not.

So, let's rethink.

Perhaps we forgot some common words.

""PIZZA"" A at 4? P1,I2,Z3,Z4,A5? A at position 5.

Not.

""JUMBA"" J? U? M? A at 3? J1,U2,M3,B4,A5? A at 5.

Not.

"" data = ["" words with A at position 4.

for example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? R absent.

""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? A at 5.

Oh,, many words have A at position 5.

Others: ""YEAST"" S absent.

""FEAST"" S absent.

"" BEAST S absent.

But we might need to consider that position 5 is open.

Another word: ""ORATE"" O1,R2,A3,T4,E5? R absent, and A at position 3.

But we know A must be at position 4.

Perhaps ""STATE"" S absent.

I think I have to choose ""EPHAH"" or similar.

Perhaps ""EIGHT"" is not, but "" high a"" no.

Let's consider the word ""CHAIN"" C absent.

Or ""THAIN"" H and T? ""THAIN"" T1,H2,A3,I4,N5? N absent, and A at position 3, not 4.

Not.

The word ""PATIO"" P1,A2,T3,I4,O5? A at 2.

Not.

""AMPLY"" A at 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""adobe"" A1,d2,o3, B4, E5? Then A at 1 and E at 5, but position 5 for E is invalid.

 not.

I recall the word ""OCTAD"" but no E.

The word ""EERIE"" no A.

We may need to output a guess even if not perfect.

Perhaps ""ADOBE"" for other reasons.

Another idea: from the feedback, we have T present but not at 2, E present not at 3 or 5, A at 4.

So for our next guess, we can try to place E at position 1 and T at position 3, for example.

Pattern: E _ T A _

Then position 2 and 5 need letters.

Words: E ? T A ?

Examples: ""EAT A"" missing letter.

""B taken"" not.

"" ECTAD"" C absent.

""EDIT A"" too long.
""EDITE"" no A.

""ELT a"" no.

""EMT a"" not word.

""ENTAD"" N absent.

""EPTAK"" not.

 a valid word: ""pieta"" as before but E in position 3.

 not.

""WHEAT"" W H E A T? But E at position 3, which is invalid ( not allowed).

Positions: W1,H2,E3,A4,T5. Then we would have E in position 3, but we know E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" feedback.

Also, A at position 4, which is good.

But E at position 3 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""TREAT"" T1,R2,E3,A4,T5? R absent, and E at 3 prohibited.

So cannot use.

The only reasonable choice I see is to guess a word like ""EPHAH"" or for E in position 2, a word like ""DEVOT"" no.

Perhaps ""ABATE"" A1,B2,A3,T4,E5? But A at 3? Position 3 is the third letter.

""ABATE"": A1,B2,A3,T4,E5.

But we need A at position 4? Here T is at 4, A at 1 and 3.

Not.

Moreover, E at position 5 is prohibited.

So not good.

Let's choose ""EPHAH"" as it fits the pattern: E P H A H

We can test it.

Or better, a more common word.

Another word: ""EYRIR"" not English.

""  "" I settle for ""EPHAH"".

Or ""EKKas"" no.

Perhaps the word ""EARTH"" R absent.

I think I found one: ""BEATH"" is not common, but ""ME ath"" no.

"" itead"" no.

I think we should guess ""DEPOT"" but no A.

Consider not including A, but we know A is at position 4, so we can keep A there and guess.

For the next guess, we can keep A in position 4 and change other letters.

Pattern: _ . . A .

With E in position 1 or 2, and T somewhere.

Spray with common letters.

For example, with E in position 2: "" E . A .""

With common letters: ""BET A"" not.
"" SET A"" S absent.

""GET A"" G E T A ? then position 3 and 5, but for ""GET A"", it's 4 letters.

""MET A"" M E T A ? then position 3? ""META"" is 4 letters.

""PETA"" short.

""VET a"" short.

Try ""META L"" not.

Perhaps ""HEALD"" L absent.

I think I need to go with a word like ""ETHIC"" no A.

But we must include A and E.

Perhaps I missed the word ""OVATE"": O1,V2,A3,T4,E5? But A at position 3, not 4; and E at 5 prohibited.

Not.

""STAVE"" S absent and A in 3 not.

No.

Another: ""DIODE"" no A.

""FERIA"" F1,E2,R3,I4,A5? R absent, and A at 5.

But position 5 for A? But our A is at position 4.

So for this guess, if we put A at position 4, but in ""FERIA"" it's at 5, so different.

We must keep A at position 4.

Therefore, I decide to guess ""EPHAH"".<thought>
Given the feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- Guess 2: ""steal"" → S(x), T(-), E(-), A(✓), L(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and L are absent.  
  - T is present but not in position 2.  
  - E is present but not in position 3 (and also not in position 5 as per Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed in position 4 (i.e., the secret word has A as the fourth letter).

Key deductions:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.
- A is fixed in position 4: the secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`.
- E must be present and can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are eliminated, and position 4 is occupied by A).
- T must be present and can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is eliminated).
- No new information about other letters, so we aim to test common unused letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U) while confirming positions for E and T.

For the next guess:
- Must include E in position 1 or 2 and T in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must keep A in position 4.
- Avoid C, R, N, S, L.
- Prioritize testing E and T positions and high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Choosing a valid word:
- After evaluating options, ""EPHAH"" fits:  
  - E in position 1 (tests E not in position 2 yet).  
  - T is not included here, but we know it must be placed in future guesses; this focuses on E's position and tests new letters.  
  - A is in position 4.  
  - Uses untested letters: P, H (avoiding absent letters).  
  - If E isn't in position 1, we'll get feedback to confirm position 2 for E.
- Other considered words like ""EXEAT"" or ""OCTAD"" were invalid due to absent letters or incorrect patterns. ""EPHAH"" is a valid (though uncommon) English word meaning a Hebrew unit of measurement.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically has:
- Common letters: to cover frequent letters in the English language.
- No repeated letters: to check more distinct letters.

Common starting words include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. Let me pick one that is likely to be accepted and provides a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 5 distinct letters.
- It includes two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- It is a valid word.

So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thought>
I am playing Wordle and need to make the first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically involves selecting a word with:
- Common vowels and consonants: to cover frequent letters in English words.
- No repeating letters: to test as many distinct letters as possible.
- A balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants. However, alternatives like ""CRANE"" or ""ROAST"" are also strong. 

Between these, ""CRANE"" is a solid choice:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct.
- It has been statistically shown to cover a wide range of possible words.

Therefore, I'll start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback efficiently.
</thought>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not C, R, or N.

Key information:
- Letters present: A and E (each appearing at least once, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""crane"")
- Letters absent: C, R, N

Since ""crane"" has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position, the A cannot be in the 3rd position of the secret word, and E cannot be in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- I need to choose a valid 5-letter word that includes A and E, and excludes C, R, N.
- Ideally, I should test other common letters not yet tried to get more information.
- Letters not yet tested include B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels to cover: O, I, U might be good, but since A and E are already present, perhaps focus on consonants.

Possible letters to consider: S, T, L, D, etc., as they appear frequently.

I want to place A and E in new positions since they can't be in position 3 or 5 respectively from the previous guess.

For example:
- A was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- E was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I should avoid putting A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Possible words: Let's think of words containing A and E.

A good candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""LEAST"", but ""slate"" has S, L, A, T, E – and we haven't tested S, L, or T yet.

However, ""slate"" has E in the 5th position, which we know can't be correct from feedback (since E got '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position, so placing E at the end again might not be optimal).

In ""crane"", E was guessed in position 5 and it's not correct, so in ""slate"", E is also in position 5, so it might get the same feedback for E.

I should try a word where E is not in position 5.

For instance, place E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's think: since A cannot be in position 3, I need to place it elsewhere.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 1, 2, or 4
- E can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Moreover, I want to test new letters.

One common starting word after feedback like this is to use ""ALIEN"" or something, but we know that C, R, N are absent, so ""alien"" uses A and E, but has L and I, which are untested.

""Alien"":
- A in position 1 (which is a possible spot for A)
- L in position 2
- I in position 3
- E in position 4 (not position 5, good)
- N in position 5 – but N is absent! We know N is not in the word, so I cannot use N because I got N(x) in previous feedback.

I cannot use N.

Similarly, avoid C, R, N.

So ""ALIEN"" is invalid because it has N.

How about ""ALIVE"": A in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5. But E in 5 – we want to avoid E in position 5 because it's wrong (E was in 5 and got '-', meaning E is not in that position).

""ALIVE"" has E in position 5, same as before.

Better to have E not in 5.

Let's think of words with E not at the end.

Examples: ""TABLE"" but that has E at the end again. ""TALES"", E in position 5? ""Tales"" is T-A-L-E-S, E in 4? Position: T-1, A-2, L-3, E-4, S-5. ""TALES"" has E in position 4.

Similarly, ""TARES"" but R is absent.

Since R is absent, avoid TARES.

Possible words: ""SAUTE"" – S-A-U-T-E, E in position 5 not good.

""SHADE"" – S-H-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

I need a word with E not in position 5 and A not in position 3.

Common word: ""PSALM"" but no E.

""PLANE"" – P-L-A-N-E, but N is absent so not good.

""SPADE"" – S-P-A-D-E, E in position 5 not good.

""LATER"" – L-A-T-E-R, but R is absent so not good.

""DATE"" is only 4 letters.

""OVATE"" – O-V-A-T-E, E in 5.

Perhaps I should accept E in position 5 for now to test other letters, but it might be inefficient since we know E is not there.

From feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5, so guessing E in position 5 again would give '-' for E, not adding new position information.

Similarly for A.

To maximize info, I should guess A in a different position and E in a different position.

A was in position 3, so try position 1, 2, or 4.

E was in position 5, so try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Idea: place A in position 1 and E in position 4, for example.

Words like ""ABUSE"": A-B-U-S-E – A in 1, E in 5 not good. E in position 5.

""ADIEU"": A-D-I-E-U – E in position 4? Positions: A-1, D-2, I-3, E-4, U-5. So E is in position 4.

""ADIEU"" is a valid word and commonly used in Wordle.

It has A in position 1 (new position for A) and E in position 4 (new for E).

Also, letters D, I, U are untested.

But U is less common; maybe there are better choices.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but E in 5.

""ALIKE"" – A-L-I-K-E, E in 5.

""AMUSE"" – A-M-U-S-E, E in 5.

How about ""HASTE"": H-A-S-T-E, E in 5.

I think I might need to accept E in position 4 or another middle position.

""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position 3 for A was already incorrect? No, A can be in other spots.

In ""DEALT"": D-1,E-2,A-3,L-4,T-5.

A is in position 3 again. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and it was wrong position. From feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore, putting A in position 3 again would not be correct and will give '-' again, which doesn't help distinguish the position.

Similarly, for E in position 5, if I guess it again, it would be '-'.

To get new information, I should avoid placing A in position 3 or E in position 5.

Therefore, for ""DEALT"", A is in position 3, which is bad to guess again.

Similarly, ""LATTE"" has A in position 2, E in position 5 – E in 5 not good.

""LEAST"": L-E-A-S-T – E in position 1, A in position 3? Position: L-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A is in position 3, which should be avoided.

If I can find a word with A not in 3 and E not in 5.

What about ""STARE""? S-T-A-R-E, but R is absent, so not good.

""TEAMS"": T-E-A-M-S – E in position 1? T-1? Position: T-1, E-2, A-3, M-4, S-5.

A is in position 3, which is bad.

How to rearrange?

I need to put A in position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PASTE"": P-A-S-T-E – A in position 2, E in position 5.

Better A in position 2, but E still in 5.

""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, same issue.

""SALAD"" no E.

""BEAST"": B-E-A-S-T – E in position 1? Positions: B-1, E-2, A-3, S-4, T-5.

A in position 3 again.

I'm struggling.

Let's list positions: let position 1,2,3,4,5.

A can be in 1,2,4.

E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, the secret word has exactly these letters: A and E are present.

Now, possible word: ""WEARY"" but has W and Y, less common.

Or ""YEARN"", but N absent and R absent.

Bad.

""HEART"" – H-E-A-R-T, but R absent.

What about ""STEAL"": S-T-E-A-L – positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, A-4, L-5.

A is in position 4 (new position), E is in position 3 (new position).

And letters S,T,L are not tested.

""STEAL"" seems good:
- S not tested
- T not tested
- E in position 3 (was not guessed in position 3 before; previously E was in position 5)
- A in position 4 (previously in position 3)
- L not tested

Also, not using forbidden letters.

Valid word.

To maximize common letters, but I think ""STEAL"" is acceptable.

Another option: ""SLATE"" , but ""slate"": S-1, L-2, A-3, T-4, E-5 – A in position 3 which is bad, E in position 5 which is bad. Avoid.

""PEACH"" no E at the end, but C is absent, not good.

So ""STEAL"" might be a good choice.

Or ""STELA"" – same as STEAL, variant spelling.

But STEAL is common.

""DREAM"" – D-R-E-A-M, but R absent.

Not good.

""ALONE"" – A-1, L-2, O-3, N-4, E-5 – but N absent, and E in 5.

Not good.

""ABLED"" – A-1, B-2, L-3, E-4, D-5 – E in position 4, A in position 1.

This could work: A not in 3, E not in 5.

Letters: B,L,E,D.

B, L, D are untested.

""ABLED"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""AGILE"" has G,I,L,E – A-1,G-2,I-3,L-4,E-5 – E in 5 not good.

"" ""AMBER"" – A-1,M-2,B-3,E-4,R-4? E-4, but R absent.

Not good.

""SHAPE"" – S-1,H-2,A-3,P-4,E-5 – A in position 3, E in 5, worse.

So between ""STEAL"" and ""ABLED"", I prefer ""STEAL"" because it has common letters like S and T, which might yield more information.

""STEAL"" puts E in the middle.

I think ""STEAL"" is fine.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" but no E, and we know E is present, but I can guess it to test vowels, but I already know A and E are present, so I should include both to confirm positions.

I think including A and E is better.

Another word: ""OCEAN"" but C absent and N absent.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""STEAL"".<thought>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: absent (x) → not in the word
- R: absent (x) → not in the word
- A: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect)
- N: absent (x) → not in the word
- E: present but wrong position (-) → must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is incorrect)

Therefore:
- The secret word contains A and E.
- Excludes C, R, N.
- A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E to gather position information.
- Avoid positions where A and E are already known to be incorrect: A not in position 3, E not in position 5.
- Avoid using C, R, or N.
- Test new common letters to gain more coverage (e.g., S, T, L).

Chose ""STEAL"" as the guess:
- Positions: S (1), T (2), E (3), A (4), L (5)
  - E is placed in position 3 (new position, not tested before).
  - A is placed in position 4 (new position, avoiding position 3 from previous guess).
- Uses untested letters S, T, L.
- Valid 5-letter English word.
- Maximizes information potential by testing frequent consonants and rearranging A and E positions.

3. Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.

Also, we know from Guess 1 that E is present, and now we have more information about its position.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have A in position 4: _ _ A _ _
- Contains E and T, but E cannot be in position 3 or 5, and T cannot be in position 2.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, S, L.

Now, since A is fixed at position 4, we need to find positions for E and T and three other letters (but total 5 letters).

We also know E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4? Wait, position 4 is taken by A, so E cannot be in position 4? Position 4 is A, so E can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since we know it's not in 3 or 5).

Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 2, so T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so T can be in 1, 3, or 5.

The word must have exactly 5 letters. Let's denote the word as P1 P2 P3 P4 P5, with P4 = A.

We have:
- E must be in P1 or P2 (the only positions left that are allowed for E).
- T must be in P1, P3, or P5.

Additionally, we must include other letters, avoiding C,R,N,S,L.

Now, for our next guess, we need to try to test possible positions for E and T and cover other frequent letters.

We might try to place E in position 1 or 2 and T in one of the allowed positions.

Since E must be in position 1 or 2, let's think of words that have A in position 4 and include E and T.

Common letters left: we have tested C,R,N,S,L and found absent. So we have letters like B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z left.

But we should prefer common letters.

Possible words:

First, if E is in position 1: E _ _ A _
Then, T could be in position 3 or 5? For example: E _ T A _

What could the second letter be? And the last letter.

Similarly, if E is in position 2: _ E _ A _

We also need to avoid S, L, R, C, N.

Let me try to think of words with pattern:

Option 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _
We need to fill positions 2,3,5. And T must be in 3 or 5.

Also, the word must contain T.

Examples: 
- E _ T A _ -> e.g., E X T A ? but let's find words.

""EXTRA"" has R and S? R is absent, not good.
""EYOTA"" not a word.
""EIGHT"" but no A? A is at 4? ""eighth"" is 6 letters. Not a 5-letter word.

Better: ""ENATE"" but N is absent? N was already ruled out.

We need to avoid R,N,S,L,C.

Possible: ""EPHAS"" not word.

Another: ""EDGAR"" but R absent and G? Not working.

""EJECT"" but C absent.

Not easy.

Option 2: E in position 2: _ E _ A _

Then T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: 
- T E _ A _ -> e.g., TEAA? no.

""TEARY"" but R is absent.
""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEATS"" has T at 1 and 4? But position 4 is A, not T. Also S absent.

""DEALT"" has T, but L absent and A is at position 3? But we need A at 4? ""DEALT"" is D-E-A-L-T, positions: D1,E2,A3,L4,T5. But we need A at position 4, not 3.

We must have A at position 4.

So patterns: _ E _ A _

Words with E in position 2 and A in position 4:

Possible: LETTER? but two T? L absent.

""METAL"": M1,E2,T3,A4,L5 -> but L is absent, cannot use.

""BETAS"" but S absent.

""PETAL"" L absent.

We avoid L.

Perhaps ""HEFT A""? H E F T A? ""HEFTA"" not a word.

It's challenging. Maybe I should list words that have A as the fourth letter and contain E.

For example: 
- __ E A _ ? No, A is at 4, so before A is position 3.

Position: 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

So words: ? + E + ? + A + ?

Example: ""BEANS"" but S and N absent.
""WEARY"" R absent and Y?
""LEGAL"" L absent and G? But L absent.
""VEGAN"" N absent.
""HEIST"" no A.

With E in position 1: E + ? + ? + A + ?

Words: ""EAGLE"" but L absent and G? E1,A2,G3,L4,E5? But A must be at 4, not 2? Wrong pattern.

No: for E in position 1 and A in position 4: E ? ? A ?

Example: ""EPOXY"" no A.
""EQUIP"" no A.
""ERASE"" R and S absent.
""EXILE"" L absent.

Perhaps it's better to allow for the possibility of E not being in position 1 or 2? But from feedback, E must be in position 1 or 2 because we've ruled out 3 and 5, and position 4 is A.

Position 4 is A, so E cannot be in position 4 because one position cannot have two letters.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.

Similarly, T in 1,3,5.

Now, another common letter is I or O or U.

We might try a word that places E in position 2 and T in position 5, for example.

Pattern: _ E _ A T

Then position 1 and 3 need letters.

Words: 
- M E ? A T -> ""MEBAT"" no.
""DEFAT"" D E F A T? ""defat"" is a word? Yes, meaning to remove fat.
- But letters: D1,E2,F3,A4,T5 -> D and F are untested.

But ""defat"" might not be very common.

Other: ""DEMAT"" similar.
""REHAT"" but R absent.

Since R is absent, not.

""BEVAT"" not word.

""HEPAT"" not common.

""DEPOT"" no A.

Not good.

Pattern with E in position 1: E ? ? A ?

And T in position 3: E ? T A ?

Then positions 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: E _ T A _

""EIGHTA"" no.
""BETAS"" S absent.
"" ZETAS"" S absent.
""EAT A"" but too short.

""METAL"" L absent.

""HETAS"" ? not word.

Perhaps ""EGYPT"" no A.

Idea: ""ENTIA"" but N and T? N absent.

Not.

Since A is fixed at position 4, and E must be in 1 or 2, and T in 1,3,5 (but if E is in 1, then T might be in 3 or 5).

Also, we know that in the first guess, E was in position 5 and was present but wrong, so if we put it at position 1 or 2, we might get new feedback.

But what words?

Let's think of common words: ""TABLE"" but A not at 4.
""BEACH"" C absent.

Another word: ""HEART"" R absent.

""PEACH"" C absent.

""OAKEN"" N and K? E? ""Oaken"" is O1,A2,K3,E4,N5? But A must be at position 4? No, we have A at position 4.

""Oaken"" has A at position 2.

We need a word with A at 4.

For example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? Then A is at position 5, not 4. Not.

""PIZZA"" A at 5.

""LLAMA"" A at 4 and 5, but L absent.

"" data = ['.....'] ""

Perhaps ""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? But N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? Oh, ""MEDIA"": positions 1:M, 2:E, 3:D, 4:I, 5:A? Not A at 4.

We need A at position 4.

For example, ""OPT A"" no.

""OPTICAL"" too long.

""LOCAL"" L absent.

Perhaps I'm missing something.

Common words with A in position 4:

Examples: 
- BOCCA? not English.
- COCKA?no.
- DELTA: D1,E2,L3,T4,A5 -> but L absent, and A at 5.
- DELTA:A at 5.

Other: ""FIRMA"" F1,I2,R3,M4,A5-> R absent.
""VISTA"" V1, I2, S3, T4, A5 -> S absent, and A at 5.
""VISTA"" has A at 5, not 4.

""TIARA"" T1,I2,A3,A4,R5? A at position 3 and 4? But we need A only at 4, and dual letter. Also R absent.

Not easy.

""ASIA"" is 4 letters.

O, ""KAPUT"" but U? A at position 2.

Perhaps ""ABACU"" no.

Let's search: words ending with vowel. But many have A at the end.

For example, ""EXTRA"" has A at the end, position 5.

But we need A at position 4.

So the word must have a letter after A, so position 5 must have a consonant usually.

For example, ""MANGA"" M1,A2,N3,G4,A5? A at 2 and 5.

""TANGA"" same.

""  ""F j  "" but not.

""ALGAE"" have A at position 1 and 4? ""ALGAE"": A1,L2,G3,A4,E5.

Ah, ""ALGAE"": A1 (position 1), L2, G3, A4, E5.

But L is absent! S,L,R,C,N are absent, so L cannot be used.

In ""ALGAE"", L is used, which is absent.

Similarly, ""ARE AE"" no.

""BAZAR"" R and Z? R absent.

No.

Perhaps ""UDDER"" no A.

I need to reconsider the position.

Another idea: maybe E is not in position 1 or 2? But we know it must be in 1 or 2 because position 3 and 5 are invalid, and 4 is A.

So no other choice.

Perhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any feedback for duplicate yet.

For example, if A appears twice? But in ""crane"" we had one A and it was not at 3, and in ""steal"" we have A at 4 correct.

If there is another A, it might be present, but feedback didn't show any additional A.

In ""crane"" we had only one A, which was -, and in ""steal"", we had one A at 4 which was correct, so probably only one A.

Similarly for E.

So let's try to find words with E in position 1 or 2, A in position 4, and including T.

And avoid C,R,N,S,L.

List of possible words:

1. E in position 1:

Pattern: E _ _ A _

Fill position 2,3,5.

Position 3 must be a consonant, etc.

Possible words: ""EDGAR"" not, R absent.
""EBOOK"" no A.
""  ""EBOLA"" B1,? E1,B2,O3,L4,A5? But L absent.
""ECHOS"" no A.
""EDUCE"" no A.
""EFF A"" no.
""EGRET"" G? R absent.
""EJECT"" C absent.
""ELFIN"" N and L absent.
""ELUTE"" L absent.
""EMAIL"" L absent.
""EPHAH"" H? ""ephah"" is E P H A H, positions: E1,P2,H3,A4,H5? Ah, A at position 4! ""EPHAH"" E1,P2,H3,A4,H5.

Valid word? EPH is a unit of measure.

Uses P and H, which are not tested.

Absent letters: avoids C,R,N,S,L? Yes.

But is it common? Not very, but valid.

Another: ""EPHOR"" but no A.

""EPHAS"" not word.

""EPHAH"" might be acceptable.

Other words: ""ETWAs"" no.

""EX eat"" no.

""EXIST"" S absent.

""EX a"" no.

So ""EPHAH"" is a possibility.

2. E in position 2:

Pattern: _ E _ A _

Position 1,3,5.

T can be in 1,3,5.

Examples: ""BE a_"" not.

""UELLA"" not.

""ME a_"" not.

""WEIGHT"" no.

""le an"" not.

""DE AIR"" not 5 letter.

""DEATH"" D E A T H? PositionsD1,E2,A3,T4,H5? But we need A at position 4? Here A is at position 3, not 4.

Mismatch.

""HEART"" H E A R T, A at 3, not 4.

GENERAL not 5.

""TEETH"" T E E T H, no A.

""PE AT"" not.

""REACT"" R absent C absent.

""TEACH"" C absent.

""MEADOW"" too long.

""CHEAP"" C absent.

""WEARY"" R absent.

"" heavy"" e at 2, but A? ""HEAVY"" H E A V Y, A at position 3.

Not at 4.

""BEADY"" B E A D Y, A at 3.

Same.

""LEADY"" L and A at 3.

Absent L.

""REAPS"" R and S absent.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps a word like ""OLEUM"" no A.

Or ""UBOAT"" no.

Another word: ""UPE at"" no.

""   ""  Let's think of ""ADIEU"" but A at 1, not 2.

Or I recall ""OCREA"" not common.

Perhaps ""AGORA"" but A at 1 and 4? ""AGORA"": A1,G2,O3,R4,A5? R absent, and A at position 1 and 5, not 4 only.

Not.

"" data word: ""ANIMA"" not.

Perhaps I should consider guessing a word with the pattern and common letters.

Since T is present but not at position 2, and we have few information, we can try to place T in position 3 or 5.

For example, with E in position 2: # E # A #

And T in position 5: then pattern _ E _ A T

Words that end with ""AT"": but it's ""E A T"", so like ""x E y A T"" but A at 4, so position 3 is something.

Position 1,2,3,4,5: (1) (E) (?) (A) (T)

So "" E ? A T""

For example, ""LEGAT"" L E G A T? But L absent.

""REBAT"" not word.
""  ""HEPAT"" not common.
""DEPOT"" not.
""DEMAT"" D E M A T? ""demat"" is not common but might be accepted? Meaning to remove material.
But letter M.

""fiat"" is 4 letters.

""VIAT U"" no.

""PIETA"" P I E T A? Positions P1,I2,E3,T4,A5? But E is at position 3? But we have feedback that E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" guess.

In ""steal"", E was in position 3 and we got E(-), meaning E is not in position 3.

Also, in this ""PIETA"" has E in position 3, which is not allowed.

Similarly, for other positions.

So back to ""EPHAH"" or other words.

Another word: ""ETHAL"" L absent.

Or ""EK a"" no.

Perhaps ""ODEUM"" no A.

I think I found one: ""BEVAN"" but N absent.

No.

""HEJRA"" R absent and J? Not.

""HEPAR"" R absent.

""KEDGE"" no A.

Perhaps ""METAL"" is out, but ""METAD"" ? not word.

""  "" let's accept ""EPHAH"" as a guess.

But it may not be efficient.

Another idea: maybe T is in position 1.

With E in position 2: pattern T E _ A _

Then position 3 and 5 to fill.

Words: T E ? A ?

Examples: ""TE a_"" like ""TEACH"" C absent.
""TEary"" R absent.
""TEADE"" not word.
""TEMPI"" no A.
""TENDU"" N absent.
""TEPAL"" L absent.
""TEUCH"" not.

""TEETH"" no A.

""TETRA"" R absent.

""TEWEL"" L absent.

""THEMA"" H? T H E M A, positions T1,H2,E3,M4,A5? Then E is at position 3, which is not allowed! We know E not in position 3.

In this pattern, E is in position 2, which is good.

""THEMA"" has T1,H2,E3,M4,A5 -> E at position 3, which is invalid position for E.

Similarly, ""TELLA"" T E L L A, L absent.

Not.

""TEEDA"" not word.

It's difficult, so I'll go with ""EPHAH"" for the guess.

But let's try E in position 1 and T in position 5: E _ _ A T

Pattern: E ? ? A T

Words: ""ELIAT"" not word.
""ENIAT"" not.
""EPPAT"" not.
""ERAAT"" not.
""ERYAT"" not.
""EVENT"" no A.
""EXEAT"" X? ""exeat"" is a word, meaning permission. Letters E1,X2,E3,A4,T5. E at position 1 and 3? That could be, because the letter E might be duplicated.

""EXEAT"" has two E's.

Feedback in ""crane"" had E at position 5 which was '-' -> so E is present, but not at position 5. Could be at other positions.

In ""steal"", E at position 3 was '-', so E is not at position 3.

But ""EXEAT"" has E at position 1 and 3.

Position 3 E might be the same as position 1 or a different occurrence.

Feedback would show for each:

In ""EXEAT"", if secret word has only one E, then the position 3 E might be marked 'x' if the secret has only one and it's at position 1.

If the secret has two E's, then position 1 E get '✓' or '-', etc.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

For ""EXEAT"" guess:
- Position 1: E: if secret word has E at 1, it's '✓', else if E present but not 1, ' -', else 'x'.
- Position 3: E: similarly.

But we know there is at least one E.

Also, we have E at position 3 being checked, but from previous feedback, we know position 3 is not correct for E, so for a new guess with E at position 3, it would likely be '-' or 'x', not '✓'.

But in this case, since we have a known E at other position, it might be marked with '-' if the secret has another E, or 'x' if not.

This could give information, but it's complicated.

Moreover, ""EXEAT"" uses X, which is infrequent.

Similarly, not ideal.

Another word: ""EGGAR"" G and R? R absent.

Not.

So, let's rethink.

Perhaps we forgot some common words.

""PIZZA"" A at 4? P1,I2,Z3,Z4,A5? A at position 5.

Not.

""JUMBA"" J? U? M? A at 3? J1,U2,M3,B4,A5? A at 5.

Not.

"" data = ["" words with A at position 4.

for example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5? R absent.

""MANIA"" M1,A2,N3,I4,A5? N absent, and A at 2 and 5.

Not at 4.

""MEDIA"" M1,E2,D3,I4,A5? A at 5.

Oh,, many words have A at position 5.

Others: ""YEAST"" S absent.

""FEAST"" S absent.

"" BEAST S absent.

But we might need to consider that position 5 is open.

Another word: ""ORATE"" O1,R2,A3,T4,E5? R absent, and A at position 3.

But we know A must be at position 4.

Perhaps ""STATE"" S absent.

I think I have to choose ""EPHAH"" or similar.

Perhaps ""EIGHT"" is not, but "" high a"" no.

Let's consider the word ""CHAIN"" C absent.

Or ""THAIN"" H and T? ""THAIN"" T1,H2,A3,I4,N5? N absent, and A at position 3, not 4.

Not.

The word ""PATIO"" P1,A2,T3,I4,O5? A at 2.

Not.

""AMPLY"" A at 1.

Not.

Perhaps ""adobe"" A1,d2,o3, B4, E5? Then A at 1 and E at 5, but position 5 for E is invalid.

 not.

I recall the word ""OCTAD"" but no E.

The word ""EERIE"" no A.

We may need to output a guess even if not perfect.

Perhaps ""ADOBE"" for other reasons.

Another idea: from the feedback, we have T present but not at 2, E present not at 3 or 5, A at 4.

So for our next guess, we can try to place E at position 1 and T at position 3, for example.

Pattern: E _ T A _

Then position 2 and 5 need letters.

Words: E ? T A ?

Examples: ""EAT A"" missing letter.

""B taken"" not.

"" ECTAD"" C absent.

""EDIT A"" too long.
""EDITE"" no A.

""ELT a"" no.

""EMT a"" not word.

""ENTAD"" N absent.

""EPTAK"" not.

 a valid word: ""pieta"" as before but E in position 3.

 not.

""WHEAT"" W H E A T? But E at position 3, which is invalid ( not allowed).

Positions: W1,H2,E3,A4,T5. Then we would have E in position 3, but we know E is not in position 3 from ""steal"" feedback.

Also, A at position 4, which is good.

But E at position 3 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""TREAT"" T1,R2,E3,A4,T5? R absent, and E at 3 prohibited.

So cannot use.

The only reasonable choice I see is to guess a word like ""EPHAH"" or for E in position 2, a word like ""DEVOT"" no.

Perhaps ""ABATE"" A1,B2,A3,T4,E5? But A at 3? Position 3 is the third letter.

""ABATE"": A1,B2,A3,T4,E5.

But we need A at position 4? Here T is at 4, A at 1 and 3.

Not.

Moreover, E at position 5 is prohibited.

So not good.

Let's choose ""EPHAH"" as it fits the pattern: E P H A H

We can test it.

Or better, a more common word.

Another word: ""EYRIR"" not English.

""  "" I settle for ""EPHAH"".

Or ""EKKas"" no.

Perhaps the word ""EARTH"" R absent.

I think I found one: ""BEATH"" is not common, but ""ME ath"" no.

"" itead"" no.

I think we should guess ""DEPOT"" but no A.

Consider not including A, but we know A is at position 4, so we can keep A there and guess.

For the next guess, we can keep A in position 4 and change other letters.

Pattern: _ . . A .

With E in position 1 or 2, and T somewhere.

Spray with common letters.

For example, with E in position 2: "" E . A .""

With common letters: ""BET A"" not.
"" SET A"" S absent.

""GET A"" G E T A ? then position 3 and 5, but for ""GET A"", it's 4 letters.

""MET A"" M E T A ? then position 3? ""META"" is 4 letters.

""PETA"" short.

""VET a"" short.

Try ""META L"" not.

Perhaps ""HEALD"" L absent.

I think I need to go with a word like ""ETHIC"" no A.

But we must include A and E.

Perhaps I missed the word ""OVATE"": O1,V2,A3,T4,E5? But A at position 3, not 4; and E at 5 prohibited.

Not.

""STAVE"" S absent and A in 3 not.

No.

Another: ""DIODE"" no A.

""FERIA"" F1,E2,R3,I4,A5? R absent, and A at 5.

But position 5 for A? But our A is at position 4.

So for this guess, if we put A at position 4, but in ""FERIA"" it's at 5, so different.

We must keep A at position 4.

Therefore, I decide to guess ""EPHAH"".<thought>
Given the feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, R, and N are absent from the secret word.  
  - A is present but not in position 3.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.

- Guess 2: ""steal"" → S(x), T(-), E(-), A(✓), L(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and L are absent.  
  - T is present but not in position 2.  
  - E is present but not in position 3 (and also not in position 5 as per Guess 1).  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed in position 4 (i.e., the secret word has A as the fourth letter).

Key deductions:
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L.
- A is fixed in position 4: the secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`.
- E must be present and can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are eliminated, and position 4 is occupied by A).
- T must be present and can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (position 2 is eliminated).
- No new information about other letters, so we aim to test common unused letters (e.g., B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U) while confirming positions for E and T.

For the next guess:
- Must include E in position 1 or 2 and T in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must keep A in position 4.
- Avoid C, R, N, S, L.
- Prioritize testing E and T positions and high-frequency consonants/vowels.

Choosing a valid word:
- After evaluating options, ""EPHAH"" fits:  
  - E in position 1 (tests E not in position 2 yet).  
  - T is not included here, but we know it must be placed in future guesses; this focuses on E's position and tests new letters.  
  - A is in position 4.  
  - Uses untested letters: P, H (avoiding absent letters).  
  - If E isn't in position 1, we'll get feedback to confirm position 2 for E.
- Other considered words like ""EXEAT"" or ""OCTAD"" were invalid due to absent letters or incorrect patterns. ""EPHAH"" is a valid (though uncommon) English word meaning a Hebrew unit of measurement.

Wait, position 4 is taken by A, so E cannot be in position 4? Position 4 is A, so E can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since we know it\'s not in 3 or 5).\n\nSimilarly, T is in the word but not in position 2, so T can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

For example: E _ T A _\n\nWhat could the second letter be? And the last letter.\n\nSimilarly, if E is in position 2: _ E _ A _\n\nWe also need to avoid S, L, R, C, N.\n\nLet me try to think of words with pattern:\n\nOption 1: E in position 1: E _ _ A _\nWe need to fill positions 2,3,5.

R is absent, not good.\n""EYOTA"" not a word.\n""EIGHT"" but no A? A is at 4? ""eighth"" is 6 letters. Not a 5-letter word.\n\nBetter: ""ENATE"" but N is absent?

A ?\n\nExample: ""EPOXY"" no A.\n""EQUIP"" no A.\n""ERASE"" R and S absent.\n""EXILE"" L absent.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to allow for the possibility of E not being in position 1 or 2? But from feedback, E must be in position 1 or 2 because we\'ve ruled out 3 and 5, and position 4 is A.\n\nPosition 4 is A, so E cannot be in position 4 because one position cannot have two letters.\n\nTherefore, E must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, T in 1,3,5.\n\nNow, another common letter is I or O or U.\n\nWe might try a word that places E in position 2 and T in position 5, for example.\n\nPattern: _ E _ A T\n\nThen position 1 and 3 need letters.\n\nWords: \n- M E ? A T -> ""MEBAT"" no.\n""DEFAT"" D E F A T? ""defat"" is a word?

E? ""Oaken"" is O1,A2,K3,E4,N5? But A must be at position 4? No, we have A at position 4.\n\n""Oaken"" has A at position 2.\n\nWe need a word with A at 4.\n\nFor example, ""ULTRA"" U1,L2,T3,R4,A5?

A at position 2.\n\nPerhaps ""ABACU"" no.\n\nLet\'s search: words ending with vowel. But many have A at the end.\n\nFor example, ""EXTRA"" has A at the end, position 5.\n\nBut we need A at position 4.\n\nSo the word must have a letter after A, so position 5 must have a consonant usually.\n\nFor example, ""MANGA"" M1,A2,N3,G4,A5? A at 2 and 5.\n\n""TANGA"" same.\n\n""  ""F j  "" but not.\n\n""ALGAE"" have A at position 1 and 4? ""ALGAE"": A1,L2,G3,A4,E5.\n\nAh, ""ALGAE"": A1 (position 1), L2, G3, A4, E5.\n\nBut L is absent!

R absent.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps ""UDDER"" no A.\n\nI need to reconsider the position.\n\nAnother idea: maybe E is not in position 1 or 2? But we know it must be in 1 or 2 because position 3 and 5 are invalid, and 4 is A.\n\nSo no other choice.\n\nPerhaps the word has duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any feedback for duplicate yet.\n\nFor example, if A appears twice? But in ""crane"" we had one A and it was not at 3, and in ""steal"" we have A at 4 correct.\n\nIf there is another A, it might be present, but feedback didn\'t show any additional A.\n\nIn ""crane"" we had only one A, which was -, and in ""steal"", we had one A at 4 which was correct, so probably only one A.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words with E in position 1 or 2, A in position 4, and including T.\n\nAnd avoid C,R,N,S,L.\n\nList of possible words:\n\n1.

We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: ""crane""**
- C(x): absent
- R(x): absent
- A(-): present, wrong position
- N(x): absent
- E(-): present, wrong position

**Guess 2: ""steal""**
- S(x): absent
- T(-): present, wrong position
- E(-): present, wrong position (specifically not position 3)
- A(✓): correct position (position 4)
- L(x): absent

**Guess 3: ""ephah""**
- E(-): present, wrong position
- P(x): absent
- H(x): absent (first H)
- A(✓): correct position (position 4)
- H(x): absent (second H)

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **A is confirmed in position 4.** So the secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ _`
2. **E is present but not in positions 3, 5 (from guess 1) or position 3 (from guess 2), and now not in position 1 (from guess 3).** Since position 4 is taken by A, E must be in position 2 (the only position left).  
   - E was guessed in position 1 (in ""ephah"") and got (-), meaning E is present but not in position 1. Previously, positions 3 and 5 were eliminated. Therefore, E can only be in position 2.
3. **T is present** (from guess 2, T(-)), and since it was in position 2 in ""steal"" but wrong, and position 2 is now E, T must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
4. **Absent letters:** C, R, N, S, L, P, H (from all feedback combined).  
   - Guessed and absent: C, R, N, S, L, P, H. H was guessed twice and both absent, so H is definitely absent.

**Letters Status:**
- Present: A (fixed at pos4), E (must be at pos2), T (somewhere else - pos1,3,5), and likely more.
- Absent: C, R, N, S, L, P, H.
- Untested/Unknown: Letters not guessed yet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Secret Word Pattern:**
Based on A at pos4 and E at pos2:
```
Position: 1   2   3   4   5
Secret:   ?   E   ?   A   ?
```
And T must be in pos1, pos3, or pos5.

**For the next guess:**
We need to:
- Confirm E in position 2 (should be ✓ now).
- Leave A in position 4.
- Place T in one of the possible positions (1,3,5) to test.
- Use new letters to cover possibilities.

**Strategy:**
- Since E and A positions are confirmed (2 and 4), our pattern should be `? E ? A ?`.
  - We can now target position 1, 3, and 5 with T and other letters.
- T should be placed somewhere it hasn't been tested: previously it was in pos2, so pos1, pos3, or pos5.
  - We can try T in position 1 or position 5 to get info.
- For the other positions, test common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, M, G) or vowels (e.g., O, I).

**Word Selection:**
- Pattern: `? E ? A ?`
- T can be at start or end, e.g., `T E ? A ?` or `? E ? A T`.
- Using common letters, let's try words like:
  - `B E T A M`: ""betam"" not a word.
  - `T E B A K`: not word.
Valid English words:
  - `T E M A D`: not word.
  - `B E D A W`: no.
Good options:
  - **""BETAT""** – not common.
  - **""DEVOT""** – not.
Focus on common words:
  - **""METAL""** – L absent, used.
  - **""FECAL""** – L absent.
Avoid absent letters.
Some possibilities:
  - `D E M A O`: not.
  - `? E ? A T`: words ending in ""EAT"" modified since E is fixed.

**Words fitting ` _ E _ A _ ` and avoiding absent letters:**
- **""REHAB""**: but R absent → invalid.
- **""BEGAT""**: B E G A T?  
  - Positions: B1, E2, G3, A4, T5.  
  - This tests T in position 5.
  - Untested letters: B, G.
- **""BEGAD""**: similar, not common.
- **""DEMO""**: 4 letters.

**Other options:**
- **""BEGAT""**: valid word (archaic for sired).
- **""BEMAD""**: not common.

- **""BEFOG""**: no A.
- **""BEVAT""**: not.

Another idea: `T E _ A _`
- **""TEACH""**: C absent → invalid.
- **""TEETH""**: no A.
- **""TEPID""**: no A.
- **""TETRA""**: R absent.
- **""TEUCH""**: not word.
- **""TEWED""**: no A.

With T in position 5 (pattern `_ E _ A T`):
- Words: B E ? A T → **""BEFAT""** not word.
- D E ? A T → **""DEFAT""** (to remove fat, rare).
- G E ? A T → **""GEOAT""** not.
- M E ? A T → **""MEBAT""** not.
- V E ? A T → **""VECAT""** not.
Common valid word: **""DEALT""** → L absent.  
But L is absent, we can't use.

**Best choice: ""BEGAT""**  
- Tests T in position 5.
- Uses B and G, common letters.
- Fits pattern `B E G A T`.

Alternatively, if T is not in position 5, we might try T in position 1: `T E _ A _`  
- **""TEGUA""** not word.
- **""TEHAD""** not.
- **""TEIID""** no A.
No common words found.

So, go with **""BEGAT""**.

**After this guess:**
- If T is in position 5, it might be correct or not.
- Feedback will guide the next move.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
   - Absent: C, R, N  
   - A present, not in position 3  
   - E present, not in position 5  

2. **Guess 2: steal → S(x) T(-) E(-) A(✓) L(x)**  
   - Absent: S, L  
   - T present, not in position 2  
   - E present, not in position 3  
   - A confirmed in position 4  

3. **Guess 3: ephah → E(-) P(x) H(x) A(✓) H(x)**  
   - E present, not in position 1  
   - Absent: P, H  
   - A remains in position 4  

### Key Deductions:
- **A is fixed in position 4**: Secret pattern is `_ _ A _ _`.
- **E must be in position 2**:  
  - E cannot be in positions 1 (ephah), 3 (steal), or 5 (crane). Only position 2 remains unused.  
- **T is present** but not in position 2. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.  
- **All absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, P, H.  
- **Untested common letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, O, T (position TBD).  
- Secret word pattern: `? E ? A ?`.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Place E in position 2 and A in position 4 to confirm E’s position.  
- Test T in position 5 to narrow its location (since positions 1/3 are easier to test later).  
- Use common untested consonants like B and G for positions 1 and 3 for maximum information.  
- **Optimal word**: ""BEGAT"" (archaic for ""sired,"" valid in Wordle dictionaries).  
  - Pattern: B (position 1), E (position 2), G (position 3), A (position 4), T (position 5).  
  - Tests:  
    - E in position 2 (likely ✓).  
    - T in position 5 (could be ✓, -, or x).  
    - New letters: B, G (high frequency).  

If T is not in position 5, feedback will confirm T’s position (1 or 3) for future guesses.

<thought>
- E must be at position 2; placing it there should yield ✓.  
- T's position is unknown; testing it at position 5 helps isolate possibilities.  
- B and G optimize coverage of common unused letters.  
- Absent letters avoided: No C,R,N,S,L,P,H.  
- ""BEGAT"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints.

  - `B E D A W`: no.
Good options:
  - **""BETAT""** – not common.
  - **""DEVOT""** – not.
Focus on common words:
  - **""METAL""** – L absent, used.
  - **""FECAL""** – L absent.
Avoid absent letters.
Some possibilities:
  - `D E M A O`: not.
  - `? E ? A T`: words ending in ""EAT"" modified since E is fixed.

**Words fitting ` _ E _ A _ ` and avoiding absent letters:**
- **""REHAB""**: but R absent → invalid.
- **""BEGAT""**: B E G A T?  
  - Positions: B1, E2, G3, A4, T5.  
  - This tests T in position 5.
  - Untested letters: B, G.
- **""BEGAD""**: similar, not common.
- **""DEMO""**: 4 letters.

**Other options:**
- **""BEGAT""**: valid word (archaic for sired).
- **""BEMAD""**: not common.

- **""BEFOG""**: no A.
- **""BEVAT""**: not.

Another idea: `T E _ A _`
- **""TEACH""**: C absent → invalid.
- **""TEETH""**: no A.
- **""TEPID""**: no A.
- **""TETRA""**: R absent.
- **""TEUCH""**: not word.
- **""TEWED""**: no A.

With T in position 5 (pattern `_ E _ A T`):
- Words: B E ? A T → **""BEFAT""** not word.
- D E ? A T → **""DEFAT""** (to remove fat, rare).
- G E ? A T → **""GEOAT""** not.
- M E ? A T → **""MEBAT""** not.
- V E ? A T → **""VECAT""** not.
Common valid word: **""DEALT""** → L absent.  
But L is absent, we can't use.

**Best choice: ""BEGAT""**  
- Tests T in position 5.
- Uses B and G, common letters.
- Fits pattern `B E G A T`.

Alternatively, if T is not in position 5, we might try T in position 1: `T E _ A _`  
- **""TEGUA""** not word.
- **""TEHAD""** not.
- **""TEIID""** no A.
No common words found.

So, go with **""BEGAT""**.

**After this guess:**
- If T is in position 5, it might be correct or not.
- Feedback will guide the next move.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)**  
   - Absent: C, R, N  
   - A present, not in position 3  
   - E present, not in position 5  

2. **Guess 2: steal → S(x) T(-) E(-) A(✓) L(x)**  
   - Absent: S, L  
   - T present, not in position 2  
   - E present, not in position 3  
   - A confirmed in position 4  

3. **Guess 3: ephah → E(-) P(x) H(x) A(✓) H(x)**  
   - E present, not in position 1  
   - Absent: P, H  
   - A remains in position 4  

### Key Deductions:
- **A is fixed in position 4**: Secret pattern is `_ _ A _ _`.
- **E must be in position 2**:  
  - E cannot be in positions 1 (ephah), 3 (steal), or 5 (crane). Only position 2 remains unused.  
- **T is present** but not in position 2. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.  
- **All absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, P, H.  
- **Untested common letters**: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, O, T (position TBD).  
- Secret word pattern: `? E ? A ?`.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Place E in position 2 and A in position 4 to confirm E’s position.  
- Test T in position 5 to narrow its location (since positions 1/3 are easier to test later).  
- Use common untested consonants like B and G for positions 1 and 3 for maximum information.  
- **Optimal word**: ""BEGAT"" (archaic for ""sired,"" valid in Wordle dictionaries).  
  - Pattern: B (position 1), E (position 2), G (position 3), A (position 4), T (position 5).  
  - Tests:  
    - E in position 2 (likely ✓).  
    - T in position 5 (could be ✓, -, or x).  
    - New letters: B, G (high frequency).  

If T is not in position 5, feedback will confirm T’s position (1 or 3) for future guesses.

<thought>
- E must be at position 2; placing it there should yield ✓.  
- T's position is unknown; testing it at position 5 helps isolate possibilities.  
- B and G optimize coverage of common unused letters.  
- Absent letters avoided: No C,R,N,S,L,P,H.  
- ""BEGAT"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting the constraints.  
</thought>",Guess 4: begat -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
