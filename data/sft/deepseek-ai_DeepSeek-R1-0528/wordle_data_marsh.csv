We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So, the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R is not in position 2 (since our guess had R in position 2 and it's wrong), and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We know:
 - The word has R and A in it.
 - C, N, E are absent.

 We should try to use a word that includes R and A (but in different positions), and avoid C, N, E.
 Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

 Since R must appear in a position other than 2, and A must appear in a position other than 3, we can try to place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for R: it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
 Similarly, A can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Let's think of words that have R and A and don't have C, N, E.

 We also know the word is 5 letters.

 I am considering common letters: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me try a word that has R and A and uses other common letters, and avoids the absent letters.

 Possibilities: words like ""PARTY"", ""TRAIL"", ""STARK"", ""STRAW"", etc.

 But note: we must avoid E, which is absent.

 Let me try ""STARK"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but feedback said A is not at position 3? Wait, no: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.
 In ""STARK"", A would be at position 3. Since we know A is not at position 3, ""STARK"" would put A in the wrong position.

 So we avoid placing A at position 3. Similarly, we avoid R at position 2.

 Let's try ""PARTY"":
 - P at 1
 - A at 2 -> allowed because A was not at 3? Yes, we don't know about position 2 for A yet. Only that it is not at 3.
 - R at position 3 -> but we know R is in the word and not at position 2, but this is position 3. Is that okay? Yes, because we don't know where R is except it's not at 2.
 - T at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new.

 However, let me reconsider: our first guess had R at position 2 and it was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word but not at that position. That doesn't prevent R from being at position 3? Actually, no: position 3 is a different position.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, but in ""PARTY"" A is at 2, which is a different position.

 But wait, we need to avoid the absent letters: we know C, N, E are absent. P, A, R, T, Y are all different and not in the absent list? Yes.

 So ""PARTY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TRAIL"":
 - T at 1
 - R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? From feedback: R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and got (-). So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not good because it has R at position 2 again.

 Similarly, let me think of another word: ""STRAW""
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - R at 3 -> okay, because R wasn't at 2? Yes, and we don't have other constraints on R's position except that it's not 2.
 - A at 4 -> okay because A wasn't at 3? Yes, and we haven't tried position 4 for A.
 - W at 5

 But we don't know if S, T, and W are present? We can use this to test.

 However, note: we have two positions for R: one we know it's not at 2. Similarly, A must be at a position other than 3.

 Both ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"" are possibilities.

 But let me consider the letters: we need to maximize information. We know R and A are in the word. We have two slots left that are either new letters or R/A again? (The word could have duplicate letters? Usually Wordle doesn't duplicate unless the secret word does. But the rules don't specify, so we assume possible duplication? Actually, in Wordle, duplication is possible.)

 However, our first guess didn't have duplicates and we don't have information about duplicates.

 But feedback for ""crane"": each letter was separate. If the word had duplicate R, then when we guessed R at position 2 and it was correct elsewhere, we might have gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, no: each instance is considered. For example, if the word is ""ROBES"" and you guess ""RISER"", you might get: R(✓) I(x) S(-) E(-) R(x) because the second R is extra? But wait, Wordle uses yellow for wrong position and green for right, and gray for absent. And if a letter appears twice but not twice in the word, it might mark one yellow and one gray? 

 To avoid complexity, I'll assume no duplicates for now, since we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS"" -> but S might be good? However, we also had N and E absent? But we don't know about S? However, ""PARTS"" has T and S.

 We must avoid C, N, E. ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S - none of C, N, E? Okay.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"", we avoid duplicates? 

 Let me decide on ""STRAW"": S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, W at 5.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"" would have B, L, A, S, T. But we don't know about B, L, S, T? However, note: we must include R and A? 

 Important: we must include R and A in our guess because we know they are in the word? No, not mandatory? But if we don't include them, we might miss on confirming their positions? However, we can test other letters? 

 But the goal is to get both the letters and positions. We know R and A are present, so we want to try them again to pin down their positions? 

 So, yes, ideally our guess includes R and A (both) again, plus three new letters to test.

 Therefore, let me choose a word that has R and A and three new consonants (since vowels A is already covered?).

 We can try ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> all not tested except A and R (and we tested R and A in the first guess). Actually, we haven't tested P, T, Y? Yes.

 Or ""STARK"": but S, T, A, R, K -> but A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

 So ""STARK"" would put A at 3? That's invalid because we know A is not in position 3? Actually, not invalid? We are allowed to guess? But it would be known that the feedback for A will be (-) again? But we would be wasting a position? We already know A is not at position 3, so we shouldn't put it there. 

 Similarly, we should use A in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 So, for efficiency, I choose ""STRAW"": 
 Position 1: S (new)
 Position 2: T (new) 
 Position 3: R (we know R is present and not at 2, so we try at 3 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 4: A (we know A is present and not at 3, so we try at 4 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 5: W (new)

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": but we know E is absent? And we don't know about M? But ""STAMP"" has M and P? And it would place A at 2? And M at 4? 

 However, we don't know about M? And we avoid E? Stamp has S, T, A, M, P? And we don't have duplicate? 

 But note: we must include R? 

 The secret word must include R! So if we don't include R, we won't learn about its position? 

 Therefore, we must include R again? And also A? Because we have only two known letters? 

 So guesses without R or A are less informative? 

 Therefore, we include both R and A? 

 But in ""STAMP""? There's no R? So that would be bad because we wouldn't get information about R? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word with R and A? 

 So ""STRAW"" is a candidate: letters S, T, R, A, W.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> also includes R and A.

 Both are fine? 

 Let me choose ""STRAW"": because it uses more common letters? 

 But let me check frequency: S and T are common? 

 Actually, I think ""PARTY"" is a good word? 

 To decide: 
 In ""STRAW"": 
   We test S at position 1, T at position 2, R at position 3, A at position 4, W at position 5.

 In ""PARTY"":
   P at position 1, A at position 2, R at position 3, T at position 4, Y at position 5.

 Which positions do we want to test? 
 We know from first guess: 
   We had R at position 2 -> wrong? So R is somewhere else? 
   We had A at position 3 -> wrong? So A is somewhere else? 

 Since we are moving both R and A to new positions, either word is good? 

 However, we also want to test new letters? 

 We also want to avoid positions that might be impossible? 

 Also, note: we have only 5 positions? 

 I'll go with ""STRAW"" because it tests S and T at positions 1 and 2? Which are common? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""TARTS""? But that has duplicate T? And we avoid? 

 Actually, without duplication? 

 But let me choose ""PARTY"": 
   It has A at position 2 -> which we haven't tried? 
   R at position 3 -> which we haven't tried? 

 We know in the first word, we tried A at position 3 and it was wrong? And R at position 2 was wrong? 

 So why not ""PARTY"": 
   Position 1: P (new)
   Position 2: A -> we know A is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 2? 
   Position 3: R -> we know R is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 3? 

 So we can get information: 
   If A is at position 2, it would be ✓? 
   Or if it's not, it would be (-) meaning in the word but not at 2? Similarly for R at 3? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate.

 However, wait: we also test T at 4 and Y at 5? 

 But also, note that we are putting R at position 3? We don't know if that is correct? 

 Another word: ""PIANO""? But N is absent? And E? But we know N and E are absent? So we cannot use? 

 So ""PARTY"" is safe? 

 Alternatively, ""CARET"" but C is absent? 

 So yes.

 Let me decide: ""PARTY""

 So my second guess is ""PARTY"".

<guess>party</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, N, and E are absent in the secret word (marked as x).
- R is present but not in position 2 (marked as -).
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and A again, but avoid positions tried earlier (R not at position 2, A not at position 3).
- We should avoid letters C, E, and N entirely.
- Ideal choices include new high-frequency letters like T, P, S, L, or Y to gather more information.
- ""PARTY"" is a strong candidate:
  - P (new letter tested at position 1).
  - A placed at position 2 (previously untested position for A).
  - R placed at position 3 (previously untested position for R).
  - T and Y (new letters at positions 4 and 5).

This tests the known letters (R and A) in new positions and introduces three new letters (P, T, Y) efficiently.

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So, the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R is not in position 2 (since our guess had R in position 2 and it's wrong), and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We know:
 - The word has R and A in it.
 - C, N, E are absent.

 We should try to use a word that includes R and A (but in different positions), and avoid C, N, E.
 Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

 Since R must appear in a position other than 2, and A must appear in a position other than 3, we can try to place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for R: it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
 Similarly, A can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Let's think of words that have R and A and don't have C, N, E.

 We also know the word is 5 letters.

 I am considering common letters: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me try a word that has R and A and uses other common letters, and avoids the absent letters.

 Possibilities: words like ""PARTY"", ""TRAIL"", ""STARK"", ""STRAW"", etc.

 But note: we must avoid E, which is absent.

 Let me try ""STARK"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but feedback said A is not at position 3? Wait, no: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.
 In ""STARK"", A would be at position 3. Since we know A is not at position 3, ""STARK"" would put A in the wrong position.

 So we avoid placing A at position 3. Similarly, we avoid R at position 2.

 Let's try ""PARTY"":
 - P at 1
 - A at 2 -> allowed because A was not at 3? Yes, we don't know about position 2 for A yet. Only that it is not at 3.
 - R at position 3 -> but we know R is in the word and not at position 2, but this is position 3. Is that okay? Yes, because we don't know where R is except it's not at 2.
 - T at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new.

 However, let me reconsider: our first guess had R at position 2 and it was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word but not at that position. That doesn't prevent R from being at position 3? Actually, no: position 3 is a different position.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, but in ""PARTY"" A is at 2, which is a different position.

 But wait, we need to avoid the absent letters: we know C, N, E are absent. P, A, R, T, Y are all different and not in the absent list? Yes.

 So ""PARTY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TRAIL"":
 - T at 1
 - R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? From feedback: R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and got (-). So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not good because it has R at position 2 again.

 Similarly, let me think of another word: ""STRAW""
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - R at 3 -> okay, because R wasn't at 2? Yes, and we don't have other constraints on R's position except that it's not 2.
 - A at 4 -> okay because A wasn't at 3? Yes, and we haven't tried position 4 for A.
 - W at 5

 But we don't know if S, T, and W are present? We can use this to test.

 However, note: we have two positions for R: one we know it's not at 2. Similarly, A must be at a position other than 3.

 Both ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"" are possibilities.

 But let me consider the letters: we need to maximize information. We know R and A are in the word. We have two slots left that are either new letters or R/A again? (The word could have duplicate letters? Usually Wordle doesn't duplicate unless the secret word does. But the rules don't specify, so we assume possible duplication?

For example, if the word is ""ROBES"" and you guess ""RISER"", you might get: R(✓) I(x) S(-) E(-) R(x) because the second R is extra? But wait, Wordle uses yellow for wrong position and green for right, and gray for absent. And if a letter appears twice but not twice in the word, it might mark one yellow and one gray? 

 To avoid complexity, I'll assume no duplicates for now, since we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS"" -> but S might be good? However, we also had N and E absent? But we don't know about S? However, ""PARTS"" has T and S.

 We must avoid C, N, E. ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S - none of C, N, E? Okay.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"", we avoid duplicates? 

 Let me decide on ""STRAW"": S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, W at 5.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"" would have B, L, A, S, T. But we don't know about B, L, S, T? However, note: we must include R and A? 

 Important: we must include R and A in our guess because we know they are in the word? No, not mandatory? But if we don't include them, we might miss on confirming their positions? However, we can test other letters?

 Therefore, let me choose a word that has R and A and three new consonants (since vowels A is already covered?).

 We can try ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> all not tested except A and R (and we tested R and A in the first guess). Actually, we haven't tested P, T, Y? Yes.

 Or ""STARK"": but S, T, A, R, K -> but A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

 So ""STARK"" would put A at 3? That's invalid because we know A is not in position 3? Actually, not invalid? We are allowed to guess? But it would be known that the feedback for A will be (-) again? But we would be wasting a position? We already know A is not at position 3, so we shouldn't put it there. 

 Similarly, we should use A in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 So, for efficiency, I choose ""STRAW"": 
 Position 1: S (new)
 Position 2: T (new) 
 Position 3: R (we know R is present and not at 2, so we try at 3 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 4: A (we know A is present and not at 3, so we try at 4 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 5: W (new)

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": but we know E is absent? And we don't know about M? But ""STAMP"" has M and P? And it would place A at 2? And M at 4? 

 However, we don't know about M? And we avoid E? Stamp has S, T, A, M, P? And we don't have duplicate? 

 But note: we must include R? 

 The secret word must include R! So if we don't include R, we won't learn about its position? 

 Therefore, we must include R again? And also A? Because we have only two known letters? 

 So guesses without R or A are less informative? 

 Therefore, we include both R and A? 

 But in ""STAMP""? There's no R? So that would be bad because we wouldn't get information about R? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word with R and A? 

 So ""STRAW"" is a candidate: letters S, T, R, A, W.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> also includes R and A.

 Both are fine? 

 Let me choose ""STRAW"": because it uses more common letters? 

 But let me check frequency: S and T are common? 

 Actually, I think ""PARTY"" is a good word? 

 To decide: 
 In ""STRAW"": 
   We test S at position 1, T at position 2, R at position 3, A at position 4, W at position 5.

 In ""PARTY"":
   P at position 1, A at position 2, R at position 3, T at position 4, Y at position 5.

 Which positions do we want to test? 
 We know from first guess: 
   We had R at position 2 -> wrong? So R is somewhere else? 
   We had A at position 3 -> wrong? So A is somewhere else? 

 Since we are moving both R and A to new positions, either word is good? 

 However, we also want to test new letters? 

 We also want to avoid positions that might be impossible? 

 Also, note: we have only 5 positions? 

 I'll go with ""STRAW"" because it tests S and T at positions 1 and 2? Which are common? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""TARTS""? But that has duplicate T? And we avoid? 

 Actually, without duplication? 

 But let me choose ""PARTY"": 
   It has A at position 2 -> which we haven't tried? 
   R at position 3 -> which we haven't tried? 

 We know in the first word, we tried A at position 3 and it was wrong? And R at position 2 was wrong? 

 So why not ""PARTY"": 
   Position 1: P (new)
   Position 2: A -> we know A is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 2? 
   Position 3: R -> we know R is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 3? 

 So we can get information: 
   If A is at position 2, it would be ✓? 
   Or if it's not, it would be (-) meaning in the word but not at 2? Similarly for R at 3? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate.

 However, wait: we also test T at 4 and Y at 5? 

 But also, note that we are putting R at position 3? We don't know if that is correct? 

 Another word: ""PIANO""? But N is absent? And E? But we know N and E are absent? So we cannot use? 

 So ""PARTY"" is safe? 

 Alternatively, ""CARET"" but C is absent? 

 So yes.

 Let me decide: ""PARTY""

 So my second guess is ""PARTY"".

<guess>party</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, N, and E are absent in the secret word (marked as x).
- R is present but not in position 2 (marked as -).
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and A again, but avoid positions tried earlier (R not at position 2, A not at position 3).
- We should avoid letters C, E, and N entirely.
- Ideal choices include new high-frequency letters like T, P, S, L, or Y to gather more information.
- ""PARTY"" is a strong candidate:
  - P (new letter tested at position 1).
  - A placed at position 2 (previously untested position for A).
  - R placed at position 3 (previously untested position for R).
  - T and Y (new letters at positions 4 and 5).

This tests the known letters (R and A) in new positions and introduces three new letters (P, T, Y) efficiently.",Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,marsh,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 Let's go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the word
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the second position
 A(-) -> A is in the word but not in the third position
 N(x) -> N is not in the word
 E(x) -> E is not in the word

 So, the secret word contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
 Also, R is not in position 2 (since our guess had R in position 2 and it's wrong), and A is not in position 3.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We know:
 - The word has R and A in it.
 - C, N, E are absent.

 We should try to use a word that includes R and A (but in different positions), and avoid C, N, E.
 Also, we should try to include other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

 Since R must appear in a position other than 2, and A must appear in a position other than 3, we can try to place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for R: it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
 Similarly, A can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Let's think of words that have R and A and don't have C, N, E.

 We also know the word is 5 letters.

 I am considering common letters: S, T, L, etc.

 Let me try a word that has R and A and uses other common letters, and avoids the absent letters.

 Possibilities: words like ""PARTY"", ""TRAIL"", ""STARK"", ""STRAW"", etc.

 But note: we must avoid E, which is absent.

 Let me try ""STARK"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but feedback said A is not at position 3? Wait, no: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.
 In ""STARK"", A would be at position 3. Since we know A is not at position 3, ""STARK"" would put A in the wrong position.

 So we avoid placing A at position 3. Similarly, we avoid R at position 2.

 Let's try ""PARTY"":
 - P at 1
 - A at 2 -> allowed because A was not at 3? Yes, we don't know about position 2 for A yet. Only that it is not at 3.
 - R at position 3 -> but we know R is in the word and not at position 2, but this is position 3. Is that okay? Yes, because we don't know where R is except it's not at 2.
 - T at 4, Y at 5.

 But note: we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new.

 However, let me reconsider: our first guess had R at position 2 and it was marked with (-) meaning it is in the word but not at that position. That doesn't prevent R from being at position 3? Actually, no: position 3 is a different position.

 Similarly, A cannot be at position 3, but in ""PARTY"" A is at 2, which is a different position.

 But wait, we need to avoid the absent letters: we know C, N, E are absent. P, A, R, T, Y are all different and not in the absent list? Yes.

 So ""PARTY"" seems okay.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TRAIL"":
 - T at 1
 - R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? From feedback: R was at position 2 in ""crane"" and got (-). So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, if we put R at position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not good because it has R at position 2 again.

 Similarly, let me think of another word: ""STRAW""
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - R at 3 -> okay, because R wasn't at 2? Yes, and we don't have other constraints on R's position except that it's not 2.
 - A at 4 -> okay because A wasn't at 3? Yes, and we haven't tried position 4 for A.
 - W at 5

 But we don't know if S, T, and W are present? We can use this to test.

 However, note: we have two positions for R: one we know it's not at 2. Similarly, A must be at a position other than 3.

 Both ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"" are possibilities.

 But let me consider the letters: we need to maximize information. We know R and A are in the word. We have two slots left that are either new letters or R/A again? (The word could have duplicate letters? Usually Wordle doesn't duplicate unless the secret word does. But the rules don't specify, so we assume possible duplication? Actually, in Wordle, duplication is possible.)

 However, our first guess didn't have duplicates and we don't have information about duplicates.

 But feedback for ""crane"": each letter was separate. If the word had duplicate R, then when we guessed R at position 2 and it was correct elsewhere, we might have gotten one R marked? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, no: each instance is considered. For example, if the word is ""ROBES"" and you guess ""RISER"", you might get: R(✓) I(x) S(-) E(-) R(x) because the second R is extra? But wait, Wordle uses yellow for wrong position and green for right, and gray for absent. And if a letter appears twice but not twice in the word, it might mark one yellow and one gray? 

 To avoid complexity, I'll assume no duplicates for now, since we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Another candidate: ""PARTS"" -> but S might be good? However, we also had N and E absent? But we don't know about S? However, ""PARTS"" has T and S.

 We must avoid C, N, E. ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S - none of C, N, E? Okay.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"" and ""STRAW"", we avoid duplicates? 

 Let me decide on ""STRAW"": S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, W at 5.

 Alternatively, ""BLAST"" would have B, L, A, S, T. But we don't know about B, L, S, T? However, note: we must include R and A? 

 Important: we must include R and A in our guess because we know they are in the word? No, not mandatory? But if we don't include them, we might miss on confirming their positions? However, we can test other letters? 

 But the goal is to get both the letters and positions. We know R and A are present, so we want to try them again to pin down their positions? 

 So, yes, ideally our guess includes R and A (both) again, plus three new letters to test.

 Therefore, let me choose a word that has R and A and three new consonants (since vowels A is already covered?).

 We can try ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> all not tested except A and R (and we tested R and A in the first guess). Actually, we haven't tested P, T, Y? Yes.

 Or ""STARK"": but S, T, A, R, K -> but A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3? So we must avoid putting A at position 3.

 So ""STARK"" would put A at 3? That's invalid because we know A is not in position 3? Actually, not invalid? We are allowed to guess? But it would be known that the feedback for A will be (-) again? But we would be wasting a position? We already know A is not at position 3, so we shouldn't put it there. 

 Similarly, we should use A in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 So, for efficiency, I choose ""STRAW"": 
 Position 1: S (new)
 Position 2: T (new) 
 Position 3: R (we know R is present and not at 2, so we try at 3 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 4: A (we know A is present and not at 3, so we try at 4 -> might be correct? Or if not, then we know)
 Position 5: W (new)

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": but we know E is absent? And we don't know about M? But ""STAMP"" has M and P? And it would place A at 2? And M at 4? 

 However, we don't know about M? And we avoid E? Stamp has S, T, A, M, P? And we don't have duplicate? 

 But note: we must include R? 

 The secret word must include R! So if we don't include R, we won't learn about its position? 

 Therefore, we must include R again? And also A? Because we have only two known letters? 

 So guesses without R or A are less informative? 

 Therefore, we include both R and A? 

 But in ""STAMP""? There's no R? So that would be bad because we wouldn't get information about R? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word with R and A? 

 So ""STRAW"" is a candidate: letters S, T, R, A, W.

 Another candidate: ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> also includes R and A.

 Both are fine? 

 Let me choose ""STRAW"": because it uses more common letters? 

 But let me check frequency: S and T are common? 

 Actually, I think ""PARTY"" is a good word? 

 To decide: 
 In ""STRAW"": 
   We test S at position 1, T at position 2, R at position 3, A at position 4, W at position 5.

 In ""PARTY"":
   P at position 1, A at position 2, R at position 3, T at position 4, Y at position 5.

 Which positions do we want to test? 
 We know from first guess: 
   We had R at position 2 -> wrong? So R is somewhere else? 
   We had A at position 3 -> wrong? So A is somewhere else? 

 Since we are moving both R and A to new positions, either word is good? 

 However, we also want to test new letters? 

 We also want to avoid positions that might be impossible? 

 Also, note: we have only 5 positions? 

 I'll go with ""STRAW"" because it tests S and T at positions 1 and 2? Which are common? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""TARTS""? But that has duplicate T? And we avoid? 

 Actually, without duplication? 

 But let me choose ""PARTY"": 
   It has A at position 2 -> which we haven't tried? 
   R at position 3 -> which we haven't tried? 

 We know in the first word, we tried A at position 3 and it was wrong? And R at position 2 was wrong? 

 So why not ""PARTY"": 
   Position 1: P (new)
   Position 2: A -> we know A is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 2? 
   Position 3: R -> we know R is in the word? It hasn't been tried at position 3? 

 So we can get information: 
   If A is at position 2, it would be ✓? 
   Or if it's not, it would be (-) meaning in the word but not at 2? Similarly for R at 3? 

 I think ""PARTY"" is a good candidate.

 However, wait: we also test T at 4 and Y at 5? 

 But also, note that we are putting R at position 3? We don't know if that is correct? 

 Another word: ""PIANO""? But N is absent? And E? But we know N and E are absent? So we cannot use? 

 So ""PARTY"" is safe? 

 Alternatively, ""CARET"" but C is absent? 

 So yes.

 Let me decide: ""PARTY""

 So my second guess is ""PARTY"".

<guess>party</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, N, and E are absent in the secret word (marked as x).
- R is present but not in position 2 (marked as -).
- A is present but not in position 3 (marked as -).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and A again, but avoid positions tried earlier (R not at position 2, A not at position 3).
- We should avoid letters C, E, and N entirely.
- Ideal choices include new high-frequency letters like T, P, S, L, or Y to gather more information.
- ""PARTY"" is a strong candidate:
  - P (new letter tested at position 1).
  - A placed at position 2 (previously untested position for A).
  - R placed at position 3 (previously untested position for R).
  - T and Y (new letters at positions 4 and 5).

This tests the known letters (R and A) in new positions and introduces three new letters (P, T, Y) efficiently.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Second guess: ""party""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- R: correct position (✓) at position 3
- T: absent (x)
- Y: absent (x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3. So the word is: _ A R _ _

2. The absent letters are: C, E, N, P, T, Y. We must avoid these.

3. We also know that the word contains at least two more letters (since we have two blanks) and they are not among the absent ones.

4. From the first guess, we know that the word has R and A, which we now have placed. Also, we learned that the word does not have C, N, E.

5. From the second guess, we know that P, T, Y are absent.

So, the known absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

We need to fill the first and last two positions (positions 1, 4, and 5).

The word: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]

We must choose a word that fits: _ A R _ _

And the letters we use for positions 1,4,5 must not be in the absent list and must form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Now, what letters are still available? We haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We know that the word has at least two more letters (for positions 1,4,5) and possibly duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: S, L, etc. are common)

But we must form a word that starts with a letter at position 1, then A, then R, and then two more letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern: _ A R _ _

Some possibilities:

- BARGE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- CARDS? But C is absent -> invalid.
- HAREM? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DARK? -> only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
- We need 5-letter words.

Let me list some 5-letter words with pattern _ A R _ _:

- BARGE (invalid because E absent)
- CARGO (C absent -> invalid)
- FARCE (F, but C and E absent -> invalid)
- HARDY (H, D, Y? But Y is absent -> invalid)
- LARVA (L, V, A? But A is already at position 2, and we have two A's? Let's check: L A R V A -> but we have A at position 2 and 5? That might be possible? But we don't know if A is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word had two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A at position 3, it might have been marked as present (yellow) even if one A is at position 2? But in ""crane"", we only had one A. Similarly, in ""party"", we had A at position 2 and it was correct, so if there is another A, we don't know? But in ""party"", we only tested one A.

But let's not assume duplicates unless necessary.

Back to possibilities:

- We need words without C, E, N, P, T, Y.

So, available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z. But A is already used? We can use A again? But we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now? Or consider them.

Possible words:

- Using S: SARS? Not 5 letters. 
  - SARGE? But E absent.
  - SARIS? That's a word? SARIS is 5 letters: S A R I S -> positions: S at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5. But S at 1 and 5? And I at 4. But we don't know about S and I? And S is not in absent list? And I is a vowel? 

But let's check: SARIS is a valid word (plural of sari).

- Other words: 
  - BARMY? B A R M Y -> but Y is absent -> invalid.
  - DARBS? D A R B S -> B and S? D A R B S: D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, B at 4, S at 5. Is DARBS a word? I think it's not common? Darb is a slang? But let's stick to common words.

Better to think of common words.

- HARSH? H A R S H -> H at 1 and 5? But H is not absent? HARSH is a word: positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H. So we have H and S? 

But we don't know about H and S? And S is common.

- Other: 
  - MARRY? M A R R Y -> but Y is absent? And also, R at 3 and 4? But we already have R at 3? And we know R is present? But if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate? But Y is absent -> invalid.
  - FARRY? Not a word? 
  - WARMS? W A R M S -> W at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5. W, M, S are not absent? So possible? WARMS is a word.

But let's list:

- HAREM? E absent -> invalid.
- LARGE? E absent -> invalid.
- MARSH? M A R S H -> M at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, H at 5. Valid word? Yes, marsh. And no absent letters? M, S, H are not in absent list.

So MARSH: M A R S H

Similarly, HARSH: H A R S H

But HARSH has duplicate H? That might be okay.

Another: BARKS? B A R K S -> K and S? But we don't know about K? And S? B A R K S: B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, K at 4, S at 5. Valid word? Yes.

But we have many options.

We need to choose one that tests new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.

Since we know positions 2 and 3 are A and R, we can focus on positions 1,4,5.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

We also know that the word must be valid.

We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested: like S, L, D, M, etc.

But we have to form a word.

Let me think of words ending with S? Because many words are plural or end with S.

For example:

- CARS? Not 5 letters.
- BARNS? But N is absent -> invalid.
- DARNS? N absent -> invalid.
- FARMS? F A R M S -> F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5. F, M, S are not absent? FARMS is a word.

Similarly, HARMS: H A R M S -> H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5.

WARNS: but N absent -> invalid.

So FARMS, HARMS, MARKS (M A R K S), BARKS (B A R K S), etc.

Also, non-S words: like BARON? But O at 4? And N absent -> invalid.

Or CAROL? C absent -> invalid.

So S-words are common.

But we also have: ALARM? A L A R M -> but that would be A at 1, L at 2? But we know position 2 is A? So if we put L at 2, it would be wrong? Because position 2 is fixed as A? 

No, the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A and position 3 is R. So the word must be _ A R _ _

So ALARM is A at 1, L at 2? But position 2 must be A, so if we guess ALARM, it would be A at 1 and A at 2? But position 2 is A, so that might be okay? But let's see: ALARM: positions 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M? No, that's not matching the pattern. The pattern is _ A R _ _, so for ALARM, it would be: if we write A L A R M, then position 2 is L? But we know position 2 must be A? So ALARM doesn't fit because position 2 is L, not A? 

I think I confused myself.

The secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3. So it must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

So ALARM: if we break it: A (position1), L (position2) -> but position2 must be A, so L cannot be there? So ALARM is not of the form _ A R _ _ because the second letter is L, not A.

Therefore, we must have a word where the second letter is A and third is R.

So back to: _ A R _ _

Now, we have to choose a word that fits and uses available letters.

We also want to maximize information? But since we have two positions to fill (1,4,5) and we know two letters, we can try to cover more new letters.

But we have three positions: 1,4,5.

We have 6 absent letters, so many letters left.

I think we should try a word that uses common letters for positions 1,4,5.

For example, S at position 1 is common? Or B? Or H?

Let me list possible words without absent letters:

- BARFS? B A R F S -> F and S? But BARFS is a word? Yes, but not very common? But valid.
- CARDS? C absent -> invalid.
- DARGS? Not a word.
- EARLS? E absent -> invalid.
- FARMS: F A R M S -> F, M, S? All not absent? Valid.
- GARBS? G A R B S -> G, B, S? Valid? GARBS is a word? Garb means clothing, so yes.
- HARKS? H A R K S -> H, K, S? Valid? Hark means to listen, so yes.
- JARLS? J A R L S -> J, L, S? J is less common? But valid word? Jarl is a historical term.
- LARIS? Not common? Lari is a currency? But let's avoid.
- MARKS: M A R K S -> M, K, S? Valid.
- NARKS? N absent -> invalid.
- OARED? O A R E D -> E absent -> invalid.
- PARKS? P absent -> invalid.
- RARER? R at 1? But we have R at 3? And E absent? Also, duplicate R? R A R E R -> but E absent -> invalid.
- SARS? Not 5 letters.
- TARES? T and E absent -> invalid.
- VARAS? V A R A S -> duplicate A? V at 1, A at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. Valid? Vara is a unit of length? But not common.
- WARBS? Not a word.
- YARNS? Y and N absent -> invalid.
- ZARFS? Z A R F S -> Z, F, S? Zarf is a holder for a coffee cup? Valid but rare.

So common words: FARMS, HARKS, MARKS, GARBS, BARKS, etc.

We also have: HARSH? H A R S H -> H at 1 and 5? Valid.

Or MARSH: M A R S H -> M, S, H? Valid.

Now, to choose one, we might want to test letters that are more common? Or we can pick one that covers more possibilities.

Since we have limited information, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested, like S, H, M, etc.

I think MARSH is a good candidate: M A R S H

- M: new letter at position 1
- A: already known at 2
- R: already known at 3
- S: new letter at position 4
- H: new letter at position 5

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, FARMS: F A R M S

But F is less common than M? Or S?

In terms of frequency, S is very common, H is common, M is common.

Another word: BARKS: B A R K S -> B and K? K is less common? But still.

I think MARSH is a solid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that includes a vowel? We haven't tested vowels except A? We know E is absent, but what about I, O, U?

For example, words like FAIRY? But Y absent -> invalid.

HAIR? Not 5 letters.

MAIRS? Not common.

OARED? E absent.

So no common words with other vowels in the pattern? Because the pattern is _ A R _ _, and after R, it might be a vowel? But in 4th position? For example, ARIAS? But that would be A at 1? And A at 2? And I at 4? A R I A S? But we have A at 2, so if we have A at 1, that's duplicate? ARIAS: A at 1, R at 2? But position 2 must be A? So R at 2? But we know position 2 is A? So ARIAS has R at position 2? That's not allowed? Because position 2 is A, not R.

Similarly, we must have A at 2 and R at 3.

So the only vowels we can have are at positions 1,4,5? But position 1 can be a vowel? Like OARED? But E absent.

UNAIS? Not common and N absent.

So it's hard to have a vowel at position 1? Or 4 or 5.

For example, MARSH has no vowel except A? But A is already there? S and H are consonants? So the word is M A R S H, which has only one vowel? But that's possible? Like in ""marsh"", it's pronounced with one vowel sound? But it has A.

Similarly, BARKS has A and the rest consonants.

So it's acceptable.

Another word: LAARI? L A A R I? Not matching pattern? Pattern is _ A R _ _, so L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, then two more? LAARI would be L A A R I? That doesn't fit.

So I think MARSH is a good guess.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was present but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? And it was correct? So that's consistent.

Similarly, R was present but not at 2? Now we have it at 3 and it was correct.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""MARSH"".

But we have to output in the format.

So <guess>marsh</guess>

But let me confirm: M is not absent? A is at 2? R at 3? S not absent? H not absent? Yes.

And it's a valid word.

We might get more information from this.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (present but wrong position), N (absent), E (absent). This reveals that R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P (absent), A (correct position), R (correct position), T (absent), Y (absent). This confirms A is in position 2 and R is in position 3, so the word pattern is `_ A R _ _`. Absent letters now include C, E, N, P, T, and Y.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **position 2 is A, position 3 is R**.
- Absent letters to avoid: **C, E, N, P, T, Y**.
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 4, and 5. These must be filled with letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, S, U, V, W, etc.).
- Goal: Choose a word that fits the pattern, uses high-frequency letters to test new possibilities, and avoids duplicates unless necessary (no evidence of duplicates yet).

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- **Test new common letters**: Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, focus on positions 1, 4, and 5. Prioritize common consonants like S, H, M, L, or B to maximize information gain.
- **Possible words**: Consider valid 5-letter words matching `_ A R _ _` without using absent letters. Examples:
  - `MARSH` (M at 1, S at 4, H at 5): Tests M, S, H—all common and untested.
  - `BARKS` (B at 1, K at 4, S at 5): Tests B and K, but K is less common.
  - `FARMS` (F at 1, M at 4, S at 5): Tests F and M, but F is less common than S or H.
  - `HARSH` (H at 1, S at 4, H at 5): Tests H and S, but has duplicate H (possible but less ideal without evidence of duplicates).
- **Why ""MARSH""?** 
  - It uses high-frequency letters: M (position 1), S (position 4), and H (position 5), all untested and not absent.
  - It's a common English word, reducing the risk of invalidity.
  - Feedback will help narrow down:
    - If M is correct (✓), it reveals position 1.
    - If S or H are correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it reveals their status and positions.
    - If any are absent (x), it expands the absent list for future guesses.

This guess efficiently tests new letters while respecting the known pattern and constraints.

<guess>marsh</guess>",marsh,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: present, but not in position 3 (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Second guess: ""party""
- P: absent (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 2
- R: correct position (✓) at position 3
- T: absent (x)
- Y: absent (x)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3. So the word is: _ A R _ _

2. The absent letters are: C, E, N, P, T, Y. We must avoid these.

3. We also know that the word contains at least two more letters (since we have two blanks) and they are not among the absent ones.

4. From the first guess, we know that the word has R and A, which we now have placed. Also, we learned that the word does not have C, N, E.

5. From the second guess, we know that P, T, Y are absent.

So, the known absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

We need to fill the first and last two positions (positions 1, 4, and 5).

The word: [1] A (2) R (3) [4] [5]

We must choose a word that fits: _ A R _ _

And the letters we use for positions 1,4,5 must not be in the absent list and must form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Now, what letters are still available? We haven't tested many consonants and vowels. We know that the word has at least two more letters (for positions 1,4,5) and possibly duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: S, L, etc. are common)

But we must form a word that starts with a letter at position 1, then A, then R, and then two more letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern: _ A R _ _

Some possibilities:

- BARGE? But E is absent -> invalid.
- CARDS? But C is absent -> invalid.
- HAREM? But E is absent -> invalid.
- DARK? -> only 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
- We need 5-letter words.

Let me list some 5-letter words with pattern _ A R _ _:

- BARGE (invalid because E absent)
- CARGO (C absent -> invalid)
- FARCE (F, but C and E absent -> invalid)
- HARDY (H, D, Y? But Y is absent -> invalid)
- LARVA (L, V, A? But A is already at position 2, and we have two A's? Let's check: L A R V A -> but we have A at position 2 and 5? That might be possible? But we don't know if A is duplicated? However, in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word had two A's, then when we guessed ""crane"" with A at position 3, it might have been marked as present (yellow) even if one A is at position 2? But in ""crane"", we only had one A. Similarly, in ""party"", we had A at position 2 and it was correct, so if there is another A, we don't know? But in ""party"", we only tested one A.

But let's not assume duplicates unless necessary.

Back to possibilities:

- We need words without C, E, N, P, T, Y.

So, available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z. But A is already used? We can use A again? But we don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now? Or consider them.

Possible words:

- Using S: SARS? Not 5 letters. 
  - SARGE? But E absent.
  - SARIS? That's a word? SARIS is 5 letters: S A R I S -> positions: S at 1, A at 2, R at 3, I at 4, S at 5. But S at 1 and 5? And I at 4. But we don't know about S and I? And S is not in absent list? And I is a vowel? 

But let's check: SARIS is a valid word (plural of sari).

- Other words: 
  - BARMY? B A R M Y -> but Y is absent -> invalid.
  - DARBS? D A R B S -> B and S? D A R B S: D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, B at 4, S at 5. Is DARBS a word? I think it's not common? Darb is a slang? But let's stick to common words.

Better to think of common words.

- HARSH? H A R S H -> H at 1 and 5? But H is not absent? HARSH is a word: positions 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H. So we have H and S? 

But we don't know about H and S? And S is common.

- Other: 
  - MARRY? M A R R Y -> but Y is absent? And also, R at 3 and 4? But we already have R at 3? And we know R is present? But if we put R at 4, it might be duplicate? But Y is absent -> invalid.
  - FARRY? Not a word? 
  - WARMS? W A R M S -> W at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5. W, M, S are not absent? So possible? WARMS is a word.

But let's list:

- HAREM? E absent -> invalid.
- LARGE? E absent -> invalid.
- MARSH? M A R S H -> M at 1, A at 2, R at 3, S at 4, H at 5. Valid word? Yes, marsh. And no absent letters? M, S, H are not in absent list.

So MARSH: M A R S H

Similarly, HARSH: H A R S H

But HARSH has duplicate H? That might be okay.

Another: BARKS? B A R K S -> K and S? But we don't know about K? And S? B A R K S: B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, K at 4, S at 5. Valid word? Yes.

But we have many options.

We need to choose one that tests new letters? But we have to fill the pattern.

Since we know positions 2 and 3 are A and R, we can focus on positions 1,4,5.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, Y.

We also know that the word must be valid.

We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested: like S, L, D, M, etc.

But we have to form a word.

Let me think of words ending with S? Because many words are plural or end with S.

For example:

- CARS? Not 5 letters.
- BARNS? But N is absent -> invalid.
- DARNS? N absent -> invalid.
- FARMS? F A R M S -> F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5. F, M, S are not absent? FARMS is a word.

Similarly, HARMS: H A R M S -> H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, M at 4, S at 5.

WARNS: but N absent -> invalid.

So FARMS, HARMS, MARKS (M A R K S), BARKS (B A R K S), etc.

Also, non-S words: like BARON? But O at 4? And N absent -> invalid.

Or CAROL? C absent -> invalid.

So S-words are common.

But we also have: ALARM? A L A R M -> but that would be A at 1, L at 2? But we know position 2 is A? So if we put L at 2, it would be wrong? Because position 2 is fixed as A? 

No, the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A and position 3 is R. So the word must be _ A R _ _

So ALARM is A at 1, L at 2? But position 2 must be A, so if we guess ALARM, it would be A at 1 and A at 2? But position 2 is A, so that might be okay? But let's see: ALARM: positions 1:A, 2:L, 3:A, 4:R, 5:M? No, that's not matching the pattern. The pattern is _ A R _ _, so for ALARM, it would be: if we write A L A R M, then position 2 is L? But we know position 2 must be A? So ALARM doesn't fit because position 2 is L, not A? 

I think I confused myself.

The secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3. So it must be: [letter] A R [letter] [letter]

So ALARM: if we break it: A (position1), L (position2) -> but position2 must be A, so L cannot be there? So ALARM is not of the form _ A R _ _ because the second letter is L, not A.

Therefore, we must have a word where the second letter is A and third is R.

So back to: _ A R _ _

Now, we have to choose a word that fits and uses available letters.

We also want to maximize information? But since we have two positions to fill (1,4,5) and we know two letters, we can try to cover more new letters.

But we have three positions: 1,4,5.

We have 6 absent letters, so many letters left.

I think we should try a word that uses common letters for positions 1,4,5.

For example, S at position 1 is common? Or B? Or H?

Let me list possible words without absent letters:

- BARFS? B A R F S -> F and S? But BARFS is a word? Yes, but not very common? But valid.
- CARDS? C absent -> invalid.
- DARGS? Not a word.
- EARLS? E absent -> invalid.
- FARMS: F A R M S -> F, M, S? All not absent? Valid.
- GARBS? G A R B S -> G, B, S? Valid? GARBS is a word? Garb means clothing, so yes.
- HARKS? H A R K S -> H, K, S? Valid? Hark means to listen, so yes.
- JARLS? J A R L S -> J, L, S? J is less common? But valid word? Jarl is a historical term.
- LARIS? Not common? Lari is a currency? But let's avoid.
- MARKS: M A R K S -> M, K, S? Valid.
- NARKS? N absent -> invalid.
- OARED? O A R E D -> E absent -> invalid.
- PARKS? P absent -> invalid.
- RARER? R at 1? But we have R at 3? And E absent? Also, duplicate R? R A R E R -> but E absent -> invalid.
- SARS? Not 5 letters.
- TARES? T and E absent -> invalid.
- VARAS? V A R A S -> duplicate A? V at 1, A at 2, R at 3, A at 4, S at 5. Valid? Vara is a unit of length? But not common.
- WARBS? Not a word.
- YARNS? Y and N absent -> invalid.
- ZARFS? Z A R F S -> Z, F, S? Zarf is a holder for a coffee cup? Valid but rare.

So common words: FARMS, HARKS, MARKS, GARBS, BARKS, etc.

We also have: HARSH? H A R S H -> H at 1 and 5? Valid.

Or MARSH: M A R S H -> M, S, H? Valid.

Now, to choose one, we might want to test letters that are more common? Or we can pick one that covers more possibilities.

Since we have limited information, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested, like S, H, M, etc.

I think MARSH is a good candidate: M A R S H

- M: new letter at position 1
- A: already known at 2
- R: already known at 3
- S: new letter at position 4
- H: new letter at position 5

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, FARMS: F A R M S

But F is less common than M? Or S?

In terms of frequency, S is very common, H is common, M is common.

Another word: BARKS: B A R K S -> B and K? K is less common? But still.

I think MARSH is a solid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that includes a vowel? We haven't tested vowels except A? We know E is absent, but what about I, O, U?

For example, words like FAIRY? But Y absent -> invalid.

HAIR? Not 5 letters.

MAIRS? Not common.

OARED? E absent.

So no common words with other vowels in the pattern? Because the pattern is _ A R _ _, and after R, it might be a vowel? But in 4th position? For example, ARIAS? But that would be A at 1? And A at 2? And I at 4? A R I A S? But we have A at 2, so if we have A at 1, that's duplicate? ARIAS: A at 1, R at 2? But position 2 must be A? So R at 2? But we know position 2 is A? So ARIAS has R at position 2? That's not allowed? Because position 2 is A, not R.

Similarly, we must have A at 2 and R at 3.

So the only vowels we can have are at positions 1,4,5? But position 1 can be a vowel? Like OARED? But E absent.

UNAIS? Not common and N absent.

So it's hard to have a vowel at position 1? Or 4 or 5.

For example, MARSH has no vowel except A? But A is already there? S and H are consonants? So the word is M A R S H, which has only one vowel? But that's possible? Like in ""marsh"", it's pronounced with one vowel sound? But it has A.

Similarly, BARKS has A and the rest consonants.

So it's acceptable.

Another word: LAARI? L A A R I? Not matching pattern? Pattern is _ A R _ _, so L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, then two more? LAARI would be L A A R I? That doesn't fit.

So I think MARSH is a good guess.

But let's consider: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and A was present but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? And it was correct? So that's consistent.

Similarly, R was present but not at 2? Now we have it at 3 and it was correct.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""MARSH"".

But we have to output in the format.

So <guess>marsh</guess>

But let me confirm: M is not absent? A is at 2? R at 3? S not absent? H not absent? Yes.

And it's a valid word.

We might get more information from this.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present but wrong position), A (present but wrong position), N (absent), E (absent). This reveals that R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
- **Guess 2: ""party""** → P (absent), A (correct position), R (correct position), T (absent), Y (absent). This confirms A is in position 2 and R is in position 3, so the word pattern is `_ A R _ _`. Absent letters now include C, E, N, P, T, and Y.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **position 2 is A, position 3 is R**.
- Absent letters to avoid: **C, E, N, P, T, Y**.
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 4, and 5. These must be filled with letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, S, U, V, W, etc.).
- Goal: Choose a word that fits the pattern, uses high-frequency letters to test new possibilities, and avoids duplicates unless necessary (no evidence of duplicates yet).

### Thought Process for Next Guess:
- **Test new common letters**: Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, focus on positions 1, 4, and 5. Prioritize common consonants like S, H, M, L, or B to maximize information gain.
- **Possible words**: Consider valid 5-letter words matching `_ A R _ _` without using absent letters. Examples:
  - `MARSH` (M at 1, S at 4, H at 5): Tests M, S, H—all common and untested.
  - `BARKS` (B at 1, K at 4, S at 5): Tests B and K, but K is less common.
  - `FARMS` (F at 1, M at 4, S at 5): Tests F and M, but F is less common than S or H.
  - `HARSH` (H at 1, S at 4, H at 5): Tests H and S, but has duplicate H (possible but less ideal without evidence of duplicates).
- **Why ""MARSH""?** 
  - It uses high-frequency letters: M (position 1), S (position 4), and H (position 5), all untested and not absent.
  - It's a common English word, reducing the risk of invalidity.
  - Feedback will help narrow down:
    - If M is correct (✓), it reveals position 1.
    - If S or H are correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it reveals their status and positions.
    - If any are absent (x), it expands the absent list for future guesses.

This guess efficiently tests new letters while respecting the known pattern and constraints.",Guess 3: marsh -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
