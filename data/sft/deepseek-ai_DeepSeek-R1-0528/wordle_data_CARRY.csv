We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Alright, let me tackle this step by step. Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C is both in the word and in the correct position (marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- N is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- E is also not in the word (marked with x).

So, from this, I know that **C** is the first letter of the secret word. The secret word must start with C. Also, **R** and **A** are both somewhere in the word, just not in the positions they were guessed in the first try—so R isn't the second letter, and A isn't the third. Since N and E are out, I shouldn't include those letters in my next guess.

Given C is fixed in position 1, I need to construct a new 5-letter word starting with C, containing R and A, but not containing N or E. Also, I should avoid placing R in the second position or A in the third position because the feedback told me those positions are wrong for those letters.

Looking at the letters I have to include: R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3). Now, I need to fill the remaining positions with other letters that are possible.

I recall that common letters in Wordle often include consonants like T, L, S, and vowels like O, I. Since E is eliminated, I can consider other vowels such as O, I, U, or maybe consonants.

Let me brainstorm possible words that start with C and contain both R and A, avoiding N and E:

- Words like ""CIRCA"" come to mind—it has C, I, R, C, A. Wait, but we have two Cs and C is fixed only in position 1. So C is not necessarily repeated. The secret word might have a C only once since we haven't gotten feedback about duplicate Cs.

Actually, ""CIRCA"" isn't valid since circa is an adverb meaning approximately and might not be a guessable word in Wordle. Alternatively, possible words:

- ""CARAT"": Position 1 C (fixed), Position 2 A—but wait, can Position 2 be A? The feedback for A said it's not in the correct position (which was position 3 in ""crane""), so Position 3 was wrong for A—but Position 2 hasn't been tested yet for A. Similarly, Position 2 hasn't been tested for R.

In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and it got -, meaning it's in the word but not in that position—so R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, A was in position 3 and got -, so it can't be in position 3. Thus, in the next guess, R shouldn't be in position 2, and A shouldn't be in position 3.

For ""CARAT"": 

- Position 1: C (good).
- Position 2: A—now A wasn't tried in position 2 before; it was tried only in position 3. So position 2 could be A? Similarly, position 5: T—we don't know.
- But CARAT has the problem of duplicate letters—R might be doubled? CARAT has two As? Actually ""carat"" has one A: C-A-R-A-T? Wait, five letters: C-A-R-A-T. So positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

But if I guess ""CARAT"":

- Position 1 C: ✓, as fixed.
- Position 2 A: Would it be ✓? We don't know yet—it could be correct or not.
- Position 3 R: Earlier feedback showed that R cannot be in position 2—but what about position 3? We didn't test R in position 3 in the first guess—we had R in position 2. Since R was marked ""-"" in position 2, it means R exists elsewhere. Position 3 hasn't been tested.

If the secret word has R in position 3, then ""CARAT"" would have R in position 3: could be ✓ if R belongs there? Similarly, A in position 4? But we don't know.

I think guessing ""CARAT"" might be suboptimal because it includes duplicate A and R—but Wordle handles duplicates.

Another option: ""CLART"" (a dialect word?), but that's obscure.

Better to choose a word with different letters to maximize information.

Another idea: Since C is fixed at position 1, I should explore R and A in other positions, and include new letters to test.

For R, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. For A, in positions 2, 4, or 5—but excluding position 3.

So words like ""CRAFT"" come to mind:

Position 1: C
Position 2: R—but wait, earlier feedback: R was guessed in position 2 and got -, meaning R cannot be in position 2. Therefore, I shouldn't put R in position 2 again—so CRAFT wouldn't work because it has R in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, avoid words with R in position 2.

What about ""CORAL""? But E is eliminated—though O is fine. But CORAL has O and L; positions: C-O-R-A-L.

But CORAL has O and L, which haven't been tested, and possible duplicates? 

Feedback possibilities for CORAL?

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 O: if O is new, could be x, -, ✓?
Position 3 R: could be ✓? Since R might be in position 3 or elsewhere.
Position 4 A: A hasn't been tried in position 4—could be -, ✓, x? Possible.
Position 5 L: x, -, ✓.

But is CORAL a valid word? Yes.

OR TRACE? But wait, TRACE starts with T, not C—don't want to lose C in position 1.

I need words starting with C, without N/E, and containing R and A.

Other options: CHARM, CHARM starts with C, then H-A-R-M? Positions: C-H-A-R-M.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 H: unknown
Position 3 A: but earlier A was in position 3 in ""crane"" and got -, so A cannot be in position 3—avoid CHARM because it places A in position 3 again—which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, any word putting A in position 3 is bad.

Therefore, I should avoid position 3 for A, as well as position 2 for R.

Now, R must appear in positions 3,4, or 5—but be aware that position 3 R might be fine since we didn't test it.

Similarly, A must be in positions 2,4, or 5.

So let's generate words starting with C, containing A and R, avoiding N/E:

- CAMRA? Not sure that's a word.

More common: ""CARTA""? Not English. ""CAROL""? Positions: C-A-R-O-L. Position 1:C, position2:A, position3:R, ... Wait, put R in position 3—which we suspect might be possible. Also, position 3 R hasn't been tested. Position 2 A: A was tried only in position 3 before—position 2 hasn't been tested for A. Similarly, O and L are new.

CAROL: positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=O, 5=L.

But CARTA? No. How about CARDS? Starts with C-A-R-D-S? Avoid E? Yes.

CARDS: C in 1, A in 2, R in 3, D and S new.

But we have to confirm CARLY? CAROB—C-A-R-O-B, meaning a carob tree? CARBS—carbohydrates? But those are valid words.

Back to CAROL: C-A-R-O-L.

If CAROL:

Position 1 C: ✓ (fixed).
Position 2 A: This is the first time we're testing A in position 2—could be ✓, -, or x? We don't know—but A is in the word according to first guess, just not position 3, so position 2 is possible. Alternatively, it could still be incorrect and A might be in position 4/5.
Position 3 R: Similarly, position 3 R—previously R was in position 2 and wrong, but position 3 R hasn't been tested—could be correct or misplaced.
Position 4 O: new letter—unknown.
Position 5 L: new letter—unknown.

Thus, guessing CAROL might give me more feedback about where A and R belong.

But CAROL has A and R in positions that could be verified.

Another solid word: ""CRAMP""—C-R-A-M-P? Positions: C-R-A-M-P.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 R: Earlier feedback told us that R cannot be in position 2—because it was guessed there and got -. Therefore, if I place R again in position 2, it would get marked as ""-"" again? Or perhaps the symbol would change? Maybe it reiterates that R is misplaced.

But actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, guessing ""CRAMP"" puts R in position 2 again—which is inefficient—we already know that’s invalid.

Thus, I should avoid words with R in positions that are disallowed—in this case, position 2.

Similarly, avoid A in position 3.

Thus, for my next guess, I should place R in position 3,4, or 5—and A in position 2,4, or 5—avoiding position 3 for A.

Position 2 A hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Position 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Now, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.

With C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.

Alternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.

Similarly, place A in positions not tried.

To maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.

Suggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.

Positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn't in position 3.

So discard words with A in position 3.

CHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.

What about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.

CARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

A is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.

But duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.

CARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.

If CARAT:

Position 1: C ✓ (given).
Position 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.
Position 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? 
Position 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? 

But we don't know.

Better to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won't know which one is right.

Instead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.

Ideal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.

Possible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.

CROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, CROWN not good.

CORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.

This seems good:

- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).
- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.
- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn't been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? 
- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.
- Position5: L – new letter, useful.

Also, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.

Word ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.

Plus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.

Thus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CORAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

Therefore:
- The secret word must start with C.
- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- A must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- The word cannot contain N or E.

For the next guess:
- I need a word starting with C, containing R and A, excluding N and E.
- To maximize information, I should test R and A in new untested positions and include new common letters.
- ""CORAL"" fits well: 
  - Starts with C (position 1, correct).
  - Places R in position 3 (new position to test).
  - Places A in position 4 (new position to test).
  - Introduces O (position 2) and L (position 5), common untouched letters.
- This avoids putting R in position 2 or A in position 3 again.

Position 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Now, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.

With C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.

Alternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.

Similarly, place A in positions not tried.

To maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.

Suggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.

Positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn't in position 3.

So discard words with A in position 3.

CHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.

What about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.

CARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

A is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.

But duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.

CARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.

If CARAT:

Position 1: C ✓ (given).
Position 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.
Position 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? 
Position 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? 

But we don't know.

Better to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won't know which one is right.

Instead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.

Ideal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.

Possible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.

CROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, CROWN not good.

CORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.

This seems good:

- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).
- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.
- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn't been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? 
- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.
- Position5: L – new letter, useful.

Also, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.

Word ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.

Plus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.

Thus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

Therefore:
- The secret word must start with C.
- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- A must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- The word cannot contain N or E.

For the next guess:
- I need a word starting with C, containing R and A, excluding N and E.
- To maximize information, I should test R and A in new untested positions and include new common letters.
- ""CORAL"" fits well: 
  - Starts with C (position 1, correct).
  - Places R in position 3 (new position to test).
  - Places A in position 4 (new position to test).
  - Introduces O (position 2) and L (position 5), common untouched letters.
- This avoids putting R in position 2 or A in position 3 again.",Guess 2: coral -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CARRY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me tackle this step by step. Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C is both in the word and in the correct position (marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- N is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- E is also not in the word (marked with x).

So, from this, I know that **C** is the first letter of the secret word. The secret word must start with C. Also, **R** and **A** are both somewhere in the word, just not in the positions they were guessed in the first try—so R isn't the second letter, and A isn't the third. Since N and E are out, I shouldn't include those letters in my next guess.

Given C is fixed in position 1, I need to construct a new 5-letter word starting with C, containing R and A, but not containing N or E. Also, I should avoid placing R in the second position or A in the third position because the feedback told me those positions are wrong for those letters.

Looking at the letters I have to include: R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3). Now, I need to fill the remaining positions with other letters that are possible.

I recall that common letters in Wordle often include consonants like T, L, S, and vowels like O, I. Since E is eliminated, I can consider other vowels such as O, I, U, or maybe consonants.

Let me brainstorm possible words that start with C and contain both R and A, avoiding N and E:

- Words like ""CIRCA"" come to mind—it has C, I, R, C, A. Wait, but we have two Cs and C is fixed only in position 1. So C is not necessarily repeated. The secret word might have a C only once since we haven't gotten feedback about duplicate Cs.

Actually, ""CIRCA"" isn't valid since circa is an adverb meaning approximately and might not be a guessable word in Wordle. Alternatively, possible words:

- ""CARAT"": Position 1 C (fixed), Position 2 A—but wait, can Position 2 be A? The feedback for A said it's not in the correct position (which was position 3 in ""crane""), so Position 3 was wrong for A—but Position 2 hasn't been tested yet for A. Similarly, Position 2 hasn't been tested for R.

In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and it got -, meaning it's in the word but not in that position—so R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, A was in position 3 and got -, so it can't be in position 3. Thus, in the next guess, R shouldn't be in position 2, and A shouldn't be in position 3.

For ""CARAT"": 

- Position 1: C (good).
- Position 2: A—now A wasn't tried in position 2 before; it was tried only in position 3. So position 2 could be A? Similarly, position 5: T—we don't know.
- But CARAT has the problem of duplicate letters—R might be doubled? CARAT has two As? Actually ""carat"" has one A: C-A-R-A-T? Wait, five letters: C-A-R-A-T. So positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

But if I guess ""CARAT"":

- Position 1 C: ✓, as fixed.
- Position 2 A: Would it be ✓? We don't know yet—it could be correct or not.
- Position 3 R: Earlier feedback showed that R cannot be in position 2—but what about position 3? We didn't test R in position 3 in the first guess—we had R in position 2. Since R was marked ""-"" in position 2, it means R exists elsewhere. Position 3 hasn't been tested.

If the secret word has R in position 3, then ""CARAT"" would have R in position 3: could be ✓ if R belongs there? Similarly, A in position 4? But we don't know.

I think guessing ""CARAT"" might be suboptimal because it includes duplicate A and R—but Wordle handles duplicates.

Another option: ""CLART"" (a dialect word?), but that's obscure.

Better to choose a word with different letters to maximize information.

Another idea: Since C is fixed at position 1, I should explore R and A in other positions, and include new letters to test.

For R, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. For A, in positions 2, 4, or 5—but excluding position 3.

So words like ""CRAFT"" come to mind:

Position 1: C
Position 2: R—but wait, earlier feedback: R was guessed in position 2 and got -, meaning R cannot be in position 2. Therefore, I shouldn't put R in position 2 again—so CRAFT wouldn't work because it has R in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, avoid words with R in position 2.

What about ""CORAL""? But E is eliminated—though O is fine. But CORAL has O and L; positions: C-O-R-A-L.

But CORAL has O and L, which haven't been tested, and possible duplicates? 

Feedback possibilities for CORAL?

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 O: if O is new, could be x, -, ✓?
Position 3 R: could be ✓? Since R might be in position 3 or elsewhere.
Position 4 A: A hasn't been tried in position 4—could be -, ✓, x? Possible.
Position 5 L: x, -, ✓.

But is CORAL a valid word? Yes.

OR TRACE? But wait, TRACE starts with T, not C—don't want to lose C in position 1.

I need words starting with C, without N/E, and containing R and A.

Other options: CHARM, CHARM starts with C, then H-A-R-M? Positions: C-H-A-R-M.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 H: unknown
Position 3 A: but earlier A was in position 3 in ""crane"" and got -, so A cannot be in position 3—avoid CHARM because it places A in position 3 again—which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, any word putting A in position 3 is bad.

Therefore, I should avoid position 3 for A, as well as position 2 for R.

Now, R must appear in positions 3,4, or 5—but be aware that position 3 R might be fine since we didn't test it.

Similarly, A must be in positions 2,4, or 5.

So let's generate words starting with C, containing A and R, avoiding N/E:

- CAMRA? Not sure that's a word.

More common: ""CARTA""? Not English. ""CAROL""? Positions: C-A-R-O-L. Position 1:C, position2:A, position3:R, ... Wait, put R in position 3—which we suspect might be possible. Also, position 3 R hasn't been tested. Position 2 A: A was tried only in position 3 before—position 2 hasn't been tested for A. Similarly, O and L are new.

CAROL: positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=O, 5=L.

But CARTA? No. How about CARDS? Starts with C-A-R-D-S? Avoid E? Yes.

CARDS: C in 1, A in 2, R in 3, D and S new.

But we have to confirm CARLY? CAROB—C-A-R-O-B, meaning a carob tree? CARBS—carbohydrates? But those are valid words.

Back to CAROL: C-A-R-O-L.

If CAROL:

Position 1 C: ✓ (fixed).
Position 2 A: This is the first time we're testing A in position 2—could be ✓, -, or x? We don't know—but A is in the word according to first guess, just not position 3, so position 2 is possible. Alternatively, it could still be incorrect and A might be in position 4/5.
Position 3 R: Similarly, position 3 R—previously R was in position 2 and wrong, but position 3 R hasn't been tested—could be correct or misplaced.
Position 4 O: new letter—unknown.
Position 5 L: new letter—unknown.

Thus, guessing CAROL might give me more feedback about where A and R belong.

But CAROL has A and R in positions that could be verified.

Another solid word: ""CRAMP""—C-R-A-M-P? Positions: C-R-A-M-P.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 R: Earlier feedback told us that R cannot be in position 2—because it was guessed there and got -. Therefore, if I place R again in position 2, it would get marked as ""-"" again? Or perhaps the symbol would change? Maybe it reiterates that R is misplaced.

But actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, guessing ""CRAMP"" puts R in position 2 again—which is inefficient—we already know that’s invalid.

Thus, I should avoid words with R in positions that are disallowed—in this case, position 2.

Similarly, avoid A in position 3.

Thus, for my next guess, I should place R in position 3,4, or 5—and A in position 2,4, or 5—avoiding position 3 for A.

Position 2 A hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Position 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Now, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.

With C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.

Alternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.

Similarly, place A in positions not tried.

To maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.

Suggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.

Positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn't in position 3.

So discard words with A in position 3.

CHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.

What about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.

CARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

A is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.

But duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.

CARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.

If CARAT:

Position 1: C ✓ (given).
Position 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.
Position 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? 
Position 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? 

But we don't know.

Better to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won't know which one is right.

Instead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.

Ideal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.

Possible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.

CROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, CROWN not good.

CORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.

This seems good:

- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).
- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.
- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn't been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? 
- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.
- Position5: L – new letter, useful.

Also, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.

Word ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.

Plus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.

Thus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

- The secret word must start with C.
- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).

Yes.\n\nCARDS: C in 1, A in 2, R in 3, D and S new.\n\nBut we have to confirm CARLY? CAROB—C-A-R-O-B, meaning a carob tree? CARBS—carbohydrates? But those are valid words.\n\nBack to CAROL: C-A-R-O-L.\n\nIf CAROL:\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓ (fixed).\nPosition 2 A: This is the first time we\'re testing A in position 2—could be ✓, -, or x? We don\'t know—but A is in the word according to first guess, just not position 3, so position 2 is possible. Alternatively, it could still be incorrect and A might be in position 4/5.\nPosition 3 R: Similarly, position 3 R—previously R was in position 2 and wrong, but position 3 R hasn\'t been tested—could be correct or misplaced.\nPosition 4 O: new letter—unknown.\nPosition 5 L: new letter—unknown.\n\nThus, guessing CAROL might give me more feedback about where A and R belong.\n\nBut CAROL has A and R in positions that could be verified.\n\nAnother solid word: ""CRAMP""—C-R-A-M-P? Positions: C-R-A-M-P.\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓\nPosition 2 R: Earlier feedback told us that R cannot be in position 2—because it was guessed there and got -. Therefore, if I place R again in position 2, it would get marked as ""-"" again? Or perhaps the symbol would change? Maybe it reiterates that R is misplaced.\n\nBut actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, guessing ""CRAMP"" puts R in position 2 again—which is inefficient—we already know that’s invalid.\n\nThus, I should avoid words with R in positions that are disallowed—in this case, position 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A in position 3.\n\nThus, for my next guess, I should place R in position 3,4, or 5—and A in position 2,4, or 5—avoiding position 3 for A.\n\nPosition 2 A hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.\n\nPosition 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.\n\nNow, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.\n\nWith C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.\n\nAlternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.\n\nSimilarly, place A in positions not tried.\n\nTo maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.\n\nSuggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.\n\nPositions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn\'t in position 3.\n\nSo discard words with A in position 3.\n\nCHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.\n\nWhat about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.\n\nCARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.\n\nA is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.\n\nBut duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.\n\nCARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.\n\nIf CARAT:\n\nPosition 1: C ✓ (given).\nPosition 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.\nPosition 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? \nPosition 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? \n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nBetter to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won\'t know which one is right.\n\nInstead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.\n\nIdeal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.\n\nPossible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.\n\nCROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.\n\nAvoid R in position 2.\n\nTherefore, CROWN not good.\n\nCORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.\n\nThis seems good:\n\n- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).\n- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.\n- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn\'t been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? \n- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.\n- Position5: L – new letter, useful.\n\nAlso, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.\n\nWord ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.\n\nPlus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.\n\nThus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- N and E are not in the word (x).\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word must start with C.\n- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).\n- A must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).\n- The word cannot contain N or E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need a word starting with C, containing R and A, excluding N and E.\n- To maximize information, I should test R and A in new untested positions and include new common letters.\n- ""CORAL"" fits well: \n  - Starts with C (position 1, correct).\n  - Places R in position 3 (new position to test).\n  - Places A in position 4 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces O (position 2) and L (position 5), common untouched letters.\n- This avoids putting R in position 2 or A in position 3 again.\n\n<guess>coral</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coral -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; so R is in the word but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""coral""
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 4? But note: we already knew A is in the word and not in position 3, now we also know it's not in position 4)
- L: x (not in the word)

So, combining the information:

1. The word starts with C (position 1).
2. R is in position 3 (from the second guess).
3. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C, and positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
4. The word does not contain: N, E, O, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word has 5 letters and we have accounted for C (pos1), R (pos3), and A (somewhere). So we need to find the remaining two letters and the exact position of A.

Since A is in position 2 or 5, we can consider two cases.

We also need to avoid the letters: N, E, O, L.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the position of A and also get information about the remaining two letters.

We know the word has the form: C _ R _ _ 
But with A in either position 2 or 5.

So two possibilities:
- If A is in position 2: then the word is C A R _ _
- If A is in position 5: then the word is C _ R _ A

We need to find the two missing letters (for positions 4 and 5 in the first case, or positions 2 and 4 in the second case) and they must be letters that are not N, E, O, L.

We should choose a word that can help distinguish between these two cases and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use new letters.

First, if we assume A is in position 2, then the word is C A R _ _. We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. We can try a word like ""CARDS"" but D and S are new, and we avoid E, O, L, N. But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Alternatively, if we assume A is in position 5, then the word is C _ R _ A. We need letters for positions 2 and 4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should design a guess that tests both possibilities.

Idea: use a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct. If we put A in position 5, then we can have a word of the form C _ R _ A.

For example, consider ""CIRCA"". But ""CIRCA"" has C, I, R, C, A? Wait, ""CIRCA"" is spelled C-I-R-C-A. But we have two C's? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know. The feedback for ""crane"" had C in position 1 correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C. Similarly, in ""coral"", C was correct and no other C was present. But we can't rule out duplicates.

However, ""CIRCA"" has C in position 1 and 4. But position 1 is fixed as C, so if we guess ""CIRCA"", then:
- Position 1: C (should be correct)
- Position 2: I (unknown)
- Position 3: R (we know is correct, so ✓)
- Position 4: C (if the secret word has C in position 4? We don't know)
- Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)

But if the secret word doesn't have a second C, then position 4 would be marked as x (if C is not in the word) or - (if C is in the word but not position 4). But we already have C in position 1, so if there is only one C, then position 4 C would be x.

But we are trying to test A in position 5. Also, we are introducing I.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have duplicate C. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARES"" but E is not allowed (from first guess, E is x). So avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Available letters: we have to avoid N, E, O, L.

Common letters left: T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form words for the two cases.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> word: C A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. Possible words: CARTS, CARDS, CARPS, CARPI, etc.

But we don't know which.

Case 2: A in position 5 -> word: C _ R _ A
We need letters for positions 2 and 4. Possible words: CIRCA (but duplicate C), TERRA (but duplicate R and T not tested), or words like CRAWL (but W and L, L is not allowed), etc.

We need to test the position of A. So let's choose a word that has A in position 5. If we do that and A is indeed in position 5, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2.

So, for the next guess, I'll put A in position 5 and use new letters for the other positions.

The word must start with C, have R in position 3 (we know that's fixed, so we can keep it), and A in position 5. Then position 2 and 4 are to be filled with new letters.

So pattern: C _ R _ A

We need to choose two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not N, E, O, L and are common.

Possible words:
- CIRCA (but duplicate C, and we don't know if C is duplicated) -> not ideal.
- CRAVA? Not a word.
- CRUDA? Not common.
- CRWTH? Not common.

Better words:
- CRUSH: but U, S, H. But position 5 is H? We want A in position 5. CRUSH ends with H.

We need to end with A.

Words ending with A: 
- ULTRA? But doesn't start with C.
- Starting with C and ending with A: CAMPA? Not word. 
- CORDA? But O is not allowed (we know O is not in the word).
- COUPA? Not word.

Common words: 
- CIRCA: C-I-R-C-A -> but duplicate C.
- COBRA: but O is not allowed (from coral, O is x).
- CAPSA? Not word.

Perhaps: CRUST? Doesn't end with A.

We need a word that ends with A and has C at start and R at position 3.

List: 
- CHINA: but H, I, N. N is not allowed (from crane, N is x). So no.
- CHERA? Not word.
- CEDAR: but E is not allowed (from crane, E is x). 
- CIGAR: G and A. Position 5 is A? C-I-G-A-R -> positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=G, 4=A, 5=R. But we need R in position 3? Here R is in position 5. So not.

We need R in position 3.

So: position 1: C, position 3: R, position 5: A.

So the word must be of the form: C ? R ? A

Now, what words are there? 
- CIRCA: C I R C A -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:R, 4:C, 5:A -> but duplicate C.
- CURIA: C U R I A -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:A -> this works, and no duplicate. U and I are new.

Is CURIA a word? Yes, it means the papal court.

Also, we avoid N, E, O, L.

So CURIA: C, U, R, I, A.

If we guess CURIA:
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: U -> could be correct or not? We don't know.
- Position 3: R -> ✓ (correct, we know)
- Position 4: I -> could be correct or not?
- Position 5: A -> we are testing if A is in position 5.

If A is in position 5, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2 (the only other possibility).

Also, we get feedback on U and I.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 2. But let's stick with testing position 5.

Another word: ""CURVA"" - but not common, and V is new.

But CURIA is acceptable.

To avoid less common words, is there a more common word?

""CARTA"" - not English.

""CRENA"" - but N is not allowed.

""CRIWA"" - not a word.

So CURIA is a valid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U or I.

Another common word: ""CRYPT"" doesn't end with A.

I think CURIA is acceptable.

But let's consider: if we guess CURIA and A is in position 5, then we get A✓ and we know the word ends with A. Then we only need to find position 2 and 4? But in CURIA, position 2 is U and position 4 is I. If they are correct, we are done. If not, we get feedback.

If A is not in position 5, then we know A must be in position 2, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARTE"" but E is not allowed.

""CARDI"" - not common, and I is new.

""CARTS"" - T and S.

But if we use ""CARTS"", which is C-A-R-T-S:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: A → if A is in position 2, then ✓, else if A is in position 5, then we get - (since A is in the word but not position 2) or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it would be -.

But in ""CARTS"", we have A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get ✓ for A. If not (i.e., if A is in position 5), then we get - for A (since A is in the word but not position 2). Also, we get feedback on T and S.

But we also have R in position 3, which is ✓.

So both approaches are valid.

But with ""CARTS"", we are testing A in position 2, and with ""CURIA"", we are testing A in position 5.

Which one to choose? We don't know which case is more likely, but we can choose based on word frequency or to maximize new letters.

In ""CARTS"", we introduce T and S, which are very common.

In ""CURIA"", we introduce U and I.

T and S are more common than U and I, so ""CARTS"" might be better? But we have to avoid E, O, L, N.

Also, note that in ""CARTS"", if A is not in position 2, we get - for A and then we know A is in position 5. Then we can focus on that.

Similarly, with ""CURIA"", if A is not in position 5, we know A is in position 2.

But with ""CARTS"", we also test T and S, which are common.

Moreover, ""CARTS"" is a common word.

So let's go with ""CARTS"".

But wait, in ""CARTS"", position 2 is A. If A is in position 2, then we get ✓, and we know the word is C A R T S? But we don't know if T and S are correct.

If not, we get feedback.

Also, if A is not in position 2, we get - for A, meaning A is in position 5, and then we know the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? In ""CARTS"", positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:T, 5:S.

So if A is in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, and we have T and S in 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5.

But we get feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? No, we can omit A to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we need to find A's position.

We must include A because it's in the word? Not necessarily, but if we don't include A, we might not get information about its position. But we can include it to get the position.

I think including A is better.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's confirm: ""CARTS"" uses T and S, which are common and not excluded.

Also, it tests A in position 2.

If we get A✓, then we know the word is C A R _ _, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if they are correct.

If we get A-, then we know A is in position 5, and the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5, so S would be x or -? And T in position 4.

But we get feedback.

Another word: ""CAMPY"" but M, P, Y and A in position 2? But we don't know about M, P, Y.

But ""CAMPY"" is not as common.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But wait, in the first guess, we had N and E excluded, and in the second, O and L excluded. So available letters: A, C, R (known), and others except N,E,O,L.

So T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

""CARTS"" uses T and S.

We can also consider ""CARDS"", but D and S.

But ""CARTS"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, to avoid putting A in a position that might be wrong, we could use a word that has A in a position we haven't tested and also has other letters.

But we have only two positions left for A: 2 or 5.

So testing one of them is good.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters. For example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and doesn't have A.

""CRUST"" doesn't end with A.

I think ""CURIA"" is acceptable, but let's go with ""CARTS"" for simplicity.

But ""CARTS"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So guess: ""CARTS""

But note: in ""CARTS"", we have S at the end. If the secret word has A in position 5, then S would be in position 5, which is not A, so S would be marked as x (if S not in word) or - (if S is in word but not position 5). But we don't know about S.

Similarly, T in position 4.

But we can get information.

Perhaps a better word: ""CATTY"" but duplicate T and A in position 2? Not good.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But let's see if there's a word that has A in position 5 and is common. ""PIZZA"" doesn't start with C.

""ULTRA"" doesn't start with C.

""EXTRA"" doesn't start with C and has E.

""ZEBRA"" has E and Z, not C.

Not many common words ending with A and starting with C with R in position 3.

""CORNU"" doesn't end with A.

So I think ""CARTS"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CARTS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - N and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O is not in the word.  
  - R is correct and in position 3 (now confirmed).  
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - L is not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **R** in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.  
- Excluded letters: **N, E, O, L** (not in the word).  
- The word structure is:  
  - **C _ R _ _** (with A in position 2 or 5).  
- Remaining positions (2, 4, and 5) need to be filled, but position 2 or 5 will be A if not tested elsewhere.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **A in position 2** to resolve its location (if A is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it must be in position 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters (N, E, O, L).  
- ""CARTS"" is a good choice:  
  - Starts with C (position 1 ✓).  
  - Places A in position 2 (to test if A is here).  
  - Keeps R in position 3 (✓, confirmed).  
  - Uses T (position 4) and S (position 5), which are common and not excluded.  
- If A is in position 2, feedback will confirm, and we focus on positions 4–5. If A is not in position 2 (feedback: A(-)), then A must be in position 5, and we can adjust accordingly.  

<guess>carts</guess>",carts,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; so R is in the word but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""coral""
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 4? But note: we already knew A is in the word and not in position 3, now we also know it's not in position 4)
- L: x (not in the word)

So, combining the information:

1. The word starts with C (position 1).
2. R is in position 3 (from the second guess).
3. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C, and positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
4. The word does not contain: N, E, O, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word has 5 letters and we have accounted for C (pos1), R (pos3), and A (somewhere). So we need to find the remaining two letters and the exact position of A.

Since A is in position 2 or 5, we can consider two cases.

We also need to avoid the letters: N, E, O, L.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the position of A and also get information about the remaining two letters.

We know the word has the form: C _ R _ _ 
But with A in either position 2 or 5.

So two possibilities:
- If A is in position 2: then the word is C A R _ _
- If A is in position 5: then the word is C _ R _ A

We need to find the two missing letters (for positions 4 and 5 in the first case, or positions 2 and 4 in the second case) and they must be letters that are not N, E, O, L.

We should choose a word that can help distinguish between these two cases and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use new letters.

First, if we assume A is in position 2, then the word is C A R _ _. We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. We can try a word like ""CARDS"" but D and S are new, and we avoid E, O, L, N. But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Alternatively, if we assume A is in position 5, then the word is C _ R _ A. We need letters for positions 2 and 4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should design a guess that tests both possibilities.

Idea: use a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct. If we put A in position 5, then we can have a word of the form C _ R _ A.

For example, consider ""CIRCA"". But ""CIRCA"" has C, I, R, C, A? Wait, ""CIRCA"" is spelled C-I-R-C-A. But we have two C's? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know. The feedback for ""crane"" had C in position 1 correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C. Similarly, in ""coral"", C was correct and no other C was present. But we can't rule out duplicates.

However, ""CIRCA"" has C in position 1 and 4. But position 1 is fixed as C, so if we guess ""CIRCA"", then:
- Position 1: C (should be correct)
- Position 2: I (unknown)
- Position 3: R (we know is correct, so ✓)
- Position 4: C (if the secret word has C in position 4? We don't know)
- Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)

But if the secret word doesn't have a second C, then position 4 would be marked as x (if C is not in the word) or - (if C is in the word but not position 4). But we already have C in position 1, so if there is only one C, then position 4 C would be x.

But we are trying to test A in position 5. Also, we are introducing I.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have duplicate C. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARES"" but E is not allowed (from first guess, E is x). So avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Available letters: we have to avoid N, E, O, L.

Common letters left: T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form words for the two cases.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> word: C A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. Possible words: CARTS, CARDS, CARPS, CARPI, etc.

But we don't know which.

Case 2: A in position 5 -> word: C _ R _ A
We need letters for positions 2 and 4. Possible words: CIRCA (but duplicate C), TERRA (but duplicate R and T not tested), or words like CRAWL (but W and L, L is not allowed), etc.

We need to test the position of A. So let's choose a word that has A in position 5. If we do that and A is indeed in position 5, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2.

So, for the next guess, I'll put A in position 5 and use new letters for the other positions.

The word must start with C, have R in position 3 (we know that's fixed, so we can keep it), and A in position 5. Then position 2 and 4 are to be filled with new letters.

So pattern: C _ R _ A

We need to choose two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not N, E, O, L and are common.

Possible words:
- CIRCA (but duplicate C, and we don't know if C is duplicated) -> not ideal.
- CRAVA? Not a word.
- CRUDA? Not common.
- CRWTH? Not common.

Better words:
- CRUSH: but U, S, H. But position 5 is H? We want A in position 5. CRUSH ends with H.

We need to end with A.

Words ending with A: 
- ULTRA? But doesn't start with C.
- Starting with C and ending with A: CAMPA? Not word. 
- CORDA? But O is not allowed (we know O is not in the word).
- COUPA? Not word.

Common words: 
- CIRCA: C-I-R-C-A -> but duplicate C.
- COBRA: but O is not allowed (from coral, O is x).
- CAPSA? Not word.

Perhaps: CRUST? Doesn't end with A.

We need a word that ends with A and has C at start and R at position 3.

List: 
- CHINA: but H, I, N. N is not allowed (from crane, N is x). So no.
- CHERA? Not word.
- CEDAR: but E is not allowed (from crane, E is x). 
- CIGAR: G and A. Position 5 is A? C-I-G-A-R -> positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=G, 4=A, 5=R. But we need R in position 3? Here R is in position 5. So not.

We need R in position 3.

So: position 1: C, position 3: R, position 5: A.

So the word must be of the form: C ? R ? A

Now, what words are there? 
- CIRCA: C I R C A -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:R, 4:C, 5:A -> but duplicate C.
- CURIA: C U R I A -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:A -> this works, and no duplicate. U and I are new.

Is CURIA a word? Yes, it means the papal court.

Also, we avoid N, E, O, L.

So CURIA: C, U, R, I, A.

If we guess CURIA:
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: U -> could be correct or not? We don't know.
- Position 3: R -> ✓ (correct, we know)
- Position 4: I -> could be correct or not?
- Position 5: A -> we are testing if A is in position 5.

If A is in position 5, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2 (the only other possibility).

Also, we get feedback on U and I.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 2. But let's stick with testing position 5.

Another word: ""CURVA"" - but not common, and V is new.

But CURIA is acceptable.

To avoid less common words, is there a more common word?

""CARTA"" - not English.

""CRENA"" - but N is not allowed.

""CRIWA"" - not a word.

So CURIA is a valid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U or I.

Another common word: ""CRYPT"" doesn't end with A.

I think CURIA is acceptable.

But let's consider: if we guess CURIA and A is in position 5, then we get A✓ and we know the word ends with A. Then we only need to find position 2 and 4? But in CURIA, position 2 is U and position 4 is I. If they are correct, we are done. If not, we get feedback.

If A is not in position 5, then we know A must be in position 2, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARTE"" but E is not allowed.

""CARDI"" - not common, and I is new.

""CARTS"" - T and S.

But if we use ""CARTS"", which is C-A-R-T-S:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: A → if A is in position 2, then ✓, else if A is in position 5, then we get - (since A is in the word but not position 2) or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it would be -.

But in ""CARTS"", we have A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get ✓ for A. If not (i.e., if A is in position 5), then we get - for A (since A is in the word but not position 2). Also, we get feedback on T and S.

But we also have R in position 3, which is ✓.

So both approaches are valid.

But with ""CARTS"", we are testing A in position 2, and with ""CURIA"", we are testing A in position 5.

Which one to choose? We don't know which case is more likely, but we can choose based on word frequency or to maximize new letters.

In ""CARTS"", we introduce T and S, which are very common.

In ""CURIA"", we introduce U and I.

T and S are more common than U and I, so ""CARTS"" might be better? But we have to avoid E, O, L, N.

Also, note that in ""CARTS"", if A is not in position 2, we get - for A and then we know A is in position 5. Then we can focus on that.

Similarly, with ""CURIA"", if A is not in position 5, we know A is in position 2.

But with ""CARTS"", we also test T and S, which are common.

Moreover, ""CARTS"" is a common word.

So let's go with ""CARTS"".

But wait, in ""CARTS"", position 2 is A. If A is in position 2, then we get ✓, and we know the word is C A R T S? But we don't know if T and S are correct.

If not, we get feedback.

Also, if A is not in position 2, we get - for A, meaning A is in position 5, and then we know the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? In ""CARTS"", positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:T, 5:S.

So if A is in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, and we have T and S in 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5.

But we get feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? No, we can omit A to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we need to find A's position.

We must include A because it's in the word? Not necessarily, but if we don't include A, we might not get information about its position. But we can include it to get the position.

I think including A is better.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's confirm: ""CARTS"" uses T and S, which are common and not excluded.

Also, it tests A in position 2.

If we get A✓, then we know the word is C A R _ _, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if they are correct.

If we get A-, then we know A is in position 5, and the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5, so S would be x or -? And T in position 4.

But we get feedback.

Another word: ""CAMPY"" but M, P, Y and A in position 2? But we don't know about M, P, Y.

But ""CAMPY"" is not as common.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But wait, in the first guess, we had N and E excluded, and in the second, O and L excluded. So available letters: A, C, R (known), and others except N,E,O,L.

So T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

""CARTS"" uses T and S.

We can also consider ""CARDS"", but D and S.

But ""CARTS"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, to avoid putting A in a position that might be wrong, we could use a word that has A in a position we haven't tested and also has other letters.

But we have only two positions left for A: 2 or 5.

So testing one of them is good.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters. For example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and doesn't have A.

""CRUST"" doesn't end with A.

I think ""CURIA"" is acceptable, but let's go with ""CARTS"" for simplicity.

But ""CARTS"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So guess: ""CARTS""

But note: in ""CARTS"", we have S at the end. If the secret word has A in position 5, then S would be in position 5, which is not A, so S would be marked as x (if S not in word) or - (if S is in word but not position 5). But we don't know about S.

Similarly, T in position 4.

But we can get information.

Perhaps a better word: ""CATTY"" but duplicate T and A in position 2? Not good.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But let's see if there's a word that has A in position 5 and is common. ""PIZZA"" doesn't start with C.

""ULTRA"" doesn't start with C.

""EXTRA"" doesn't start with C and has E.

""ZEBRA"" has E and Z, not C.

Not many common words ending with A and starting with C with R in position 3.

""CORNU"" doesn't end with A.

So I think ""CARTS"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CARTS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - N and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O is not in the word.  
  - R is correct and in position 3 (now confirmed).  
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - L is not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **R** in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.  
- Excluded letters: **N, E, O, L** (not in the word).  
- The word structure is:  
  - **C _ R _ _** (with A in position 2 or 5).  
- Remaining positions (2, 4, and 5) need to be filled, but position 2 or 5 will be A if not tested elsewhere.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **A in position 2** to resolve its location (if A is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it must be in position 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters (N, E, O, L).  
- ""CARTS"" is a good choice:  
  - Starts with C (position 1 ✓).  
  - Places A in position 2 (to test if A is here).  
  - Keeps R in position 3 (✓, confirmed).  
  - Uses T (position 4) and S (position 5), which are common and not excluded.  
- If A is in position 2, feedback will confirm, and we focus on positions 4–5. If A is not in position 2 (feedback: A(-)), then A must be in position 5, and we can adjust accordingly.",Guess 3: carts -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let me tackle this step by step. Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C is both in the word and in the correct position (marked with ✓).
- R is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).
- N is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- E is also not in the word (marked with x).

So, from this, I know that **C** is the first letter of the secret word. The secret word must start with C. Also, **R** and **A** are both somewhere in the word, just not in the positions they were guessed in the first try—so R isn't the second letter, and A isn't the third. Since N and E are out, I shouldn't include those letters in my next guess.

Given C is fixed in position 1, I need to construct a new 5-letter word starting with C, containing R and A, but not containing N or E. Also, I should avoid placing R in the second position or A in the third position because the feedback told me those positions are wrong for those letters.

Looking at the letters I have to include: R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in position 3). Now, I need to fill the remaining positions with other letters that are possible.

I recall that common letters in Wordle often include consonants like T, L, S, and vowels like O, I. Since E is eliminated, I can consider other vowels such as O, I, U, or maybe consonants.

Let me brainstorm possible words that start with C and contain both R and A, avoiding N and E:

- Words like ""CIRCA"" come to mind—it has C, I, R, C, A. Wait, but we have two Cs and C is fixed only in position 1. So C is not necessarily repeated. The secret word might have a C only once since we haven't gotten feedback about duplicate Cs.

Actually, ""CIRCA"" isn't valid since circa is an adverb meaning approximately and might not be a guessable word in Wordle. Alternatively, possible words:

- ""CARAT"": Position 1 C (fixed), Position 2 A—but wait, can Position 2 be A? The feedback for A said it's not in the correct position (which was position 3 in ""crane""), so Position 3 was wrong for A—but Position 2 hasn't been tested yet for A. Similarly, Position 2 hasn't been tested for R.

In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and it got -, meaning it's in the word but not in that position—so R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, A was in position 3 and got -, so it can't be in position 3. Thus, in the next guess, R shouldn't be in position 2, and A shouldn't be in position 3.

For ""CARAT"": 

- Position 1: C (good).
- Position 2: A—now A wasn't tried in position 2 before; it was tried only in position 3. So position 2 could be A? Similarly, position 5: T—we don't know.
- But CARAT has the problem of duplicate letters—R might be doubled? CARAT has two As? Actually ""carat"" has one A: C-A-R-A-T? Wait, five letters: C-A-R-A-T. So positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

But if I guess ""CARAT"":

- Position 1 C: ✓, as fixed.
- Position 2 A: Would it be ✓? We don't know yet—it could be correct or not.
- Position 3 R: Earlier feedback showed that R cannot be in position 2—but what about position 3? We didn't test R in position 3 in the first guess—we had R in position 2. Since R was marked ""-"" in position 2, it means R exists elsewhere. Position 3 hasn't been tested.

If the secret word has R in position 3, then ""CARAT"" would have R in position 3: could be ✓ if R belongs there? Similarly, A in position 4? But we don't know.

I think guessing ""CARAT"" might be suboptimal because it includes duplicate A and R—but Wordle handles duplicates.

Another option: ""CLART"" (a dialect word?), but that's obscure.

Better to choose a word with different letters to maximize information.

Another idea: Since C is fixed at position 1, I should explore R and A in other positions, and include new letters to test.

For R, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. For A, in positions 2, 4, or 5—but excluding position 3.

So words like ""CRAFT"" come to mind:

Position 1: C
Position 2: R—but wait, earlier feedback: R was guessed in position 2 and got -, meaning R cannot be in position 2. Therefore, I shouldn't put R in position 2 again—so CRAFT wouldn't work because it has R in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Similarly, avoid words with R in position 2.

What about ""CORAL""? But E is eliminated—though O is fine. But CORAL has O and L; positions: C-O-R-A-L.

But CORAL has O and L, which haven't been tested, and possible duplicates? 

Feedback possibilities for CORAL?

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 O: if O is new, could be x, -, ✓?
Position 3 R: could be ✓? Since R might be in position 3 or elsewhere.
Position 4 A: A hasn't been tried in position 4—could be -, ✓, x? Possible.
Position 5 L: x, -, ✓.

But is CORAL a valid word? Yes.

OR TRACE? But wait, TRACE starts with T, not C—don't want to lose C in position 1.

I need words starting with C, without N/E, and containing R and A.

Other options: CHARM, CHARM starts with C, then H-A-R-M? Positions: C-H-A-R-M.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 H: unknown
Position 3 A: but earlier A was in position 3 in ""crane"" and got -, so A cannot be in position 3—avoid CHARM because it places A in position 3 again—which we know is incorrect.

Similarly, any word putting A in position 3 is bad.

Therefore, I should avoid position 3 for A, as well as position 2 for R.

Now, R must appear in positions 3,4, or 5—but be aware that position 3 R might be fine since we didn't test it.

Similarly, A must be in positions 2,4, or 5.

So let's generate words starting with C, containing A and R, avoiding N/E:

- CAMRA? Not sure that's a word.

More common: ""CARTA""? Not English. ""CAROL""? Positions: C-A-R-O-L. Position 1:C, position2:A, position3:R, ... Wait, put R in position 3—which we suspect might be possible. Also, position 3 R hasn't been tested. Position 2 A: A was tried only in position 3 before—position 2 hasn't been tested for A. Similarly, O and L are new.

CAROL: positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=O, 5=L.

But CARTA? No. How about CARDS? Starts with C-A-R-D-S? Avoid E? Yes.

CARDS: C in 1, A in 2, R in 3, D and S new.

But we have to confirm CARLY? CAROB—C-A-R-O-B, meaning a carob tree? CARBS—carbohydrates? But those are valid words.

Back to CAROL: C-A-R-O-L.

If CAROL:

Position 1 C: ✓ (fixed).
Position 2 A: This is the first time we're testing A in position 2—could be ✓, -, or x? We don't know—but A is in the word according to first guess, just not position 3, so position 2 is possible. Alternatively, it could still be incorrect and A might be in position 4/5.
Position 3 R: Similarly, position 3 R—previously R was in position 2 and wrong, but position 3 R hasn't been tested—could be correct or misplaced.
Position 4 O: new letter—unknown.
Position 5 L: new letter—unknown.

Thus, guessing CAROL might give me more feedback about where A and R belong.

But CAROL has A and R in positions that could be verified.

Another solid word: ""CRAMP""—C-R-A-M-P? Positions: C-R-A-M-P.

Position 1 C: ✓
Position 2 R: Earlier feedback told us that R cannot be in position 2—because it was guessed there and got -. Therefore, if I place R again in position 2, it would get marked as ""-"" again? Or perhaps the symbol would change? Maybe it reiterates that R is misplaced.

But actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, guessing ""CRAMP"" puts R in position 2 again—which is inefficient—we already know that’s invalid.

Thus, I should avoid words with R in positions that are disallowed—in this case, position 2.

Similarly, avoid A in position 3.

Thus, for my next guess, I should place R in position 3,4, or 5—and A in position 2,4, or 5—avoiding position 3 for A.

Position 2 A hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Position 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.

Now, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.

With C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.

Alternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.

Similarly, place A in positions not tried.

To maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.

Suggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.

Positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn't in position 3.

So discard words with A in position 3.

CHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.

What about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.

CARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.

A is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.

But duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.

CARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.

If CARAT:

Position 1: C ✓ (given).
Position 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.
Position 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? 
Position 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? 

But we don't know.

Better to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won't know which one is right.

Instead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.

Ideal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.

Possible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.

CROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.

Avoid R in position 2.

Therefore, CROWN not good.

CORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.

This seems good:

- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).
- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.
- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn't been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? 
- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.
- Position5: L – new letter, useful.

Also, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.

Word ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.

Plus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.

Thus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

Therefore:
- The secret word must start with C.
- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).
- A must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).
- The word cannot contain N or E.

For the next guess:
- I need a word starting with C, containing R and A, excluding N and E.
- To maximize information, I should test R and A in new untested positions and include new common letters.
- ""CORAL"" fits well: 
  - Starts with C (position 1, correct).
  - Places R in position 3 (new position to test).
  - Places A in position 4 (new position to test).
  - Introduces O (position 2) and L (position 5), common untouched letters.
- This avoids putting R in position 2 or A in position 3 again.

- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 4? But note: we already knew A is in the word and not in position 3, now we also know it's not in position 4)
- L: x (not in the word)

So, combining the information:

1. The word starts with C (position 1).
2. R is in position 3 (from the second guess).
3. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C, and positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
4. The word does not contain: N, E, O, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the word has 5 letters and we have accounted for C (pos1), R (pos3), and A (somewhere). So we need to find the remaining two letters and the exact position of A.

Since A is in position 2 or 5, we can consider two cases.

We also need to avoid the letters: N, E, O, L.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the position of A and also get information about the remaining two letters.

We know the word has the form: C _ R _ _ 
But with A in either position 2 or 5.

So two possibilities:
- If A is in position 2: then the word is C A R _ _
- If A is in position 5: then the word is C _ R _ A

We need to find the two missing letters (for positions 4 and 5 in the first case, or positions 2 and 4 in the second case) and they must be letters that are not N, E, O, L.

We should choose a word that can help distinguish between these two cases and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit one of the patterns and use new letters.

First, if we assume A is in position 2, then the word is C A R _ _. We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. We can try a word like ""CARDS"" but D and S are new, and we avoid E, O, L, N. But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Alternatively, if we assume A is in position 5, then the word is C _ R _ A. We need letters for positions 2 and 4.

But we don't know which case it is. So we should design a guess that tests both possibilities.

Idea: use a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct. If we put A in position 5, then we can have a word of the form C _ R _ A.

For example, consider ""CIRCA"". But ""CIRCA"" has C, I, R, C, A? Wait, ""CIRCA"" is spelled C-I-R-C-A. But we have two C's? The secret word might have only one C? We don't know. The feedback for ""crane"" had C in position 1 correct, but that doesn't say anything about duplicate C. Similarly, in ""coral"", C was correct and no other C was present. But we can't rule out duplicates.

However, ""CIRCA"" has C in position 1 and 4. But position 1 is fixed as C, so if we guess ""CIRCA"", then:
- Position 1: C (should be correct)
- Position 2: I (unknown)
- Position 3: R (we know is correct, so ✓)
- Position 4: C (if the secret word has C in position 4? We don't know)
- Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)

But if the secret word doesn't have a second C, then position 4 would be marked as x (if C is not in the word) or - (if C is in the word but not position 4). But we already have C in position 1, so if there is only one C, then position 4 C would be x.

But we are trying to test A in position 5. Also, we are introducing I.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have duplicate C. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARES"" but E is not allowed (from first guess, E is x). So avoid E.

We cannot use E.

Available letters: we have to avoid N, E, O, L.

Common letters left: T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form words for the two cases.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> word: C A R _ _
We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. Possible words: CARTS, CARDS, CARPS, CARPI, etc.

But we don't know which.

Case 2: A in position 5 -> word: C _ R _ A
We need letters for positions 2 and 4. Possible words: CIRCA (but duplicate C), TERRA (but duplicate R and T not tested), or words like CRAWL (but W and L, L is not allowed), etc.

We need to test the position of A. So let's choose a word that has A in position 5. If we do that and A is indeed in position 5, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2.

So, for the next guess, I'll put A in position 5 and use new letters for the other positions.

The word must start with C, have R in position 3 (we know that's fixed, so we can keep it), and A in position 5. Then position 2 and 4 are to be filled with new letters.

So pattern: C _ R _ A

We need to choose two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not N, E, O, L and are common.

Possible words:
- CIRCA (but duplicate C, and we don't know if C is duplicated) -> not ideal.
- CRAVA? Not a word.
- CRUDA? Not common.
- CRWTH? Not common.

Better words:
- CRUSH: but U, S, H. But position 5 is H? We want A in position 5. CRUSH ends with H.

We need to end with A.

Words ending with A: 
- ULTRA? But doesn't start with C.
- Starting with C and ending with A: CAMPA? Not word. 
- CORDA? But O is not allowed (we know O is not in the word).
- COUPA? Not word.

Common words: 
- CIRCA: C-I-R-C-A -> but duplicate C.
- COBRA: but O is not allowed (from coral, O is x).
- CAPSA? Not word.

Perhaps: CRUST? Doesn't end with A.

We need a word that ends with A and has C at start and R at position 3.

List: 
- CHINA: but H, I, N. N is not allowed (from crane, N is x). So no.
- CHERA? Not word.
- CEDAR: but E is not allowed (from crane, E is x). 
- CIGAR: G and A. Position 5 is A? C-I-G-A-R -> positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=G, 4=A, 5=R. But we need R in position 3? Here R is in position 5. So not.

We need R in position 3.

So: position 1: C, position 3: R, position 5: A.

So the word must be of the form: C ? R ? A

Now, what words are there? 
- CIRCA: C I R C A -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:R, 4:C, 5:A -> but duplicate C.
- CURIA: C U R I A -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:A -> this works, and no duplicate. U and I are new.

Is CURIA a word? Yes, it means the papal court.

Also, we avoid N, E, O, L.

So CURIA: C, U, R, I, A.

If we guess CURIA:
- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: U -> could be correct or not? We don't know.
- Position 3: R -> ✓ (correct, we know)
- Position 4: I -> could be correct or not?
- Position 5: A -> we are testing if A is in position 5.

If A is in position 5, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2 (the only other possibility).

Also, we get feedback on U and I.

Alternatively, we could test A in position 2. But let's stick with testing position 5.

Another word: ""CURVA"" - but not common, and V is new.

But CURIA is acceptable.

To avoid less common words, is there a more common word?

""CARTA"" - not English.

""CRENA"" - but N is not allowed.

""CRIWA"" - not a word.

So CURIA is a valid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U or I.

Another common word: ""CRYPT"" doesn't end with A.

I think CURIA is acceptable.

But let's consider: if we guess CURIA and A is in position 5, then we get A✓ and we know the word ends with A. Then we only need to find position 2 and 4? But in CURIA, position 2 is U and position 4 is I. If they are correct, we are done. If not, we get feedback.

If A is not in position 5, then we know A must be in position 2, and we can focus on that.

So it's a good test.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARTE"" but E is not allowed.

""CARDI"" - not common, and I is new.

""CARTS"" - T and S.

But if we use ""CARTS"", which is C-A-R-T-S:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: A → if A is in position 2, then ✓, else if A is in position 5, then we get - (since A is in the word but not position 2) or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it would be -.

But in ""CARTS"", we have A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get ✓ for A. If not (i.e., if A is in position 5), then we get - for A (since A is in the word but not position 2). Also, we get feedback on T and S.

But we also have R in position 3, which is ✓.

So both approaches are valid.

But with ""CARTS"", we are testing A in position 2, and with ""CURIA"", we are testing A in position 5.

Which one to choose? We don't know which case is more likely, but we can choose based on word frequency or to maximize new letters.

In ""CARTS"", we introduce T and S, which are very common.

In ""CURIA"", we introduce U and I.

T and S are more common than U and I, so ""CARTS"" might be better? But we have to avoid E, O, L, N.

Also, note that in ""CARTS"", if A is not in position 2, we get - for A and then we know A is in position 5. Then we can focus on that.

Similarly, with ""CURIA"", if A is not in position 5, we know A is in position 2.

But with ""CARTS"", we also test T and S, which are common.

Moreover, ""CARTS"" is a common word.

So let's go with ""CARTS"".

But wait, in ""CARTS"", position 2 is A. If A is in position 2, then we get ✓, and we know the word is C A R T S? But we don't know if T and S are correct.

If not, we get feedback.

Also, if A is not in position 2, we get - for A, meaning A is in position 5, and then we know the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? In ""CARTS"", positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:T, 5:S.

So if A is in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, and we have T and S in 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5.

But we get feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? No, we can omit A to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we need to find A's position.

We must include A because it's in the word? Not necessarily, but if we don't include A, we might not get information about its position. But we can include it to get the position.

I think including A is better.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's confirm: ""CARTS"" uses T and S, which are common and not excluded.

Also, it tests A in position 2.

If we get A✓, then we know the word is C A R _ _, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if they are correct.

If we get A-, then we know A is in position 5, and the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5, so S would be x or -? And T in position 4.

But we get feedback.

Another word: ""CAMPY"" but M, P, Y and A in position 2? But we don't know about M, P, Y.

But ""CAMPY"" is not as common.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But wait, in the first guess, we had N and E excluded, and in the second, O and L excluded. So available letters: A, C, R (known), and others except N,E,O,L.

So T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.

""CARTS"" uses T and S.

We can also consider ""CARDS"", but D and S.

But ""CARTS"" is more common.

So I'll go with ""CARTS"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, to avoid putting A in a position that might be wrong, we could use a word that has A in a position we haven't tested and also has other letters.

But we have only two positions left for A: 2 or 5.

So testing one of them is good.

Another idea: use a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters. For example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and doesn't have A.

""CRUST"" doesn't end with A.

I think ""CURIA"" is acceptable, but let's go with ""CARTS"" for simplicity.

But ""CARTS"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So guess: ""CARTS""

But note: in ""CARTS"", we have S at the end. If the secret word has A in position 5, then S would be in position 5, which is not A, so S would be marked as x (if S not in word) or - (if S is in word but not position 5). But we don't know about S.

Similarly, T in position 4.

But we can get information.

Perhaps a better word: ""CATTY"" but duplicate T and A in position 2? Not good.

I think ""CARTS"" is fine.

But let's see if there's a word that has A in position 5 and is common. ""PIZZA"" doesn't start with C.

""ULTRA"" doesn't start with C.

""EXTRA"" doesn't start with C and has E.

""ZEBRA"" has E and Z, not C.

Not many common words ending with A and starting with C with R in position 3.

""CORNU"" doesn't end with A.

So I think ""CARTS"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CARTS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - N and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O is not in the word.  
  - R is correct and in position 3 (now confirmed).  
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - L is not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **R** in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.  
- Excluded letters: **N, E, O, L** (not in the word).  
- The word structure is:  
  - **C _ R _ _** (with A in position 2 or 5).  
- Remaining positions (2, 4, and 5) need to be filled, but position 2 or 5 will be A if not tested elsewhere.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **A in position 2** to resolve its location (if A is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it must be in position 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters (N, E, O, L).  
- ""CARTS"" is a good choice:  
  - Starts with C (position 1 ✓).  
  - Places A in position 2 (to test if A is here).  
  - Keeps R in position 3 (✓, confirmed).  
  - Uses T (position 4) and S (position 5), which are common and not excluded.  
- If A is in position 2, feedback will confirm, and we focus on positions 4–5. If A is not in position 2 (feedback: A(-)), then A must be in position 5, and we can adjust accordingly.

Based on the previous feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n\n- C is both in the word and in the correct position (marked with ✓).\n- R is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).\n- A is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).\n- N is not in the word at all (marked with x).\n- E is also not in the word (marked with x).\n\nSo, from this, I know that **C** is the first letter of the secret word. The secret word must start with C. Also, **R** and **A** are both somewhere in the word, just not in the positions they were guessed in the first try—so R isn\'t the second letter, and A isn\'t the third. Since N and E are out, I shouldn\'t include those letters in my next guess.\n\nGiven C is fixed in position 1, I need to construct a new 5-letter word starting with C, containing R and A, but not containing N or E. Also, I should avoid placing R in the second position or A in the third position because the feedback told me those positions are wrong for those letters.\n\nLooking at the letters I have to include: R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can\'t be in position 3). Now, I need to fill the remaining positions with other letters that are possible.\n\nI recall that common letters in Wordle often include consonants like T, L, S, and vowels like O, I. Since E is eliminated, I can consider other vowels such as O, I, U, or maybe consonants.\n\nLet me brainstorm possible words that start with C and contain both R and A, avoiding N and E:\n\n- Words like ""CIRCA"" come to mind—it has C, I, R, C, A. Wait, but we have two Cs and C is fixed only in position 1. So C is not necessarily repeated. The secret word might have a C only once since we haven\'t gotten feedback about duplicate Cs.\n\nActually, ""CIRCA"" isn\'t valid since circa is an adverb meaning approximately and might not be a guessable word in Wordle. Alternatively, possible words:\n\n- ""CARAT"": Position 1 C (fixed), Position 2 A—but wait, can Position 2 be A? The feedback for A said it\'s not in the correct position (which was position 3 in ""crane""), so Position 3 was wrong for A—but Position 2 hasn\'t been tested yet for A. Similarly, Position 2 hasn\'t been tested for R.\n\nIn ""crane"", R was in position 2 and it got -, meaning it\'s in the word but not in that position—so R cannot be in position 2. Similarly, A was in position 3 and got -, so it can\'t be in position 3. Thus, in the next guess, R shouldn\'t be in position 2, and A shouldn\'t be in position 3.\n\nFor ""CARAT"": \n\n- Position 1: C (good).\n- Position 2: A—now A wasn\'t tried in position 2 before; it was tried only in position 3. So position 2 could be A? Similarly, position 5: T—we don\'t know.\n- But CARAT has the problem of duplicate letters—R might be doubled? CARAT has two As? Actually ""carat"" has one A: C-A-R-A-T? Wait, five letters: C-A-R-A-T. So positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.\n\nBut if I guess ""CARAT"":\n\n- Position 1 C: ✓, as fixed.\n- Position 2 A: Would it be ✓? We don\'t know yet—it could be correct or not.\n- Position 3 R: Earlier feedback showed that R cannot be in position 2—but what about position 3? We didn\'t test R in position 3 in the first guess—we had R in position 2. Since R was marked ""-"" in position 2, it means R exists elsewhere. Position 3 hasn\'t been tested.\n\nIf the secret word has R in position 3, then ""CARAT"" would have R in position 3: could be ✓ if R belongs there? Similarly, A in position 4? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think guessing ""CARAT"" might be suboptimal because it includes duplicate A and R—but Wordle handles duplicates.\n\nAnother option: ""CLART"" (a dialect word?), but that\'s obscure.\n\nBetter to choose a word with different letters to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: Since C is fixed at position 1, I should explore R and A in other positions, and include new letters to test.\n\nFor R, it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. For A, in positions 2, 4, or 5—but excluding position 3.\n\nSo words like ""CRAFT"" come to mind:\n\nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: R—but wait, earlier feedback: R was guessed in position 2 and got -, meaning R cannot be in position 2. Therefore, I shouldn\'t put R in position 2 again—so CRAFT wouldn\'t work because it has R in position 2, which we know is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, avoid words with R in position 2.\n\nWhat about ""CORAL""? But E is eliminated—though O is fine. But CORAL has O and L; positions: C-O-R-A-L.\n\nBut CORAL has O and L, which haven\'t been tested, and possible duplicates? \n\nFeedback possibilities for CORAL?\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓\nPosition 2 O: if O is new, could be x, -, ✓?\nPosition 3 R: could be ✓? Since R might be in position 3 or elsewhere.\nPosition 4 A: A hasn\'t been tried in position 4—could be -, ✓, x? Possible.\nPosition 5 L: x, -, ✓.\n\nBut is CORAL a valid word? Yes.\n\nOR TRACE? But wait, TRACE starts with T, not C—don\'t want to lose C in position 1.\n\nI need words starting with C, without N/E, and containing R and A.\n\nOther options: CHARM, CHARM starts with C, then H-A-R-M? Positions: C-H-A-R-M.\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓\nPosition 2 H: unknown\nPosition 3 A: but earlier A was in position 3 in ""crane"" and got -, so A cannot be in position 3—avoid CHARM because it places A in position 3 again—which we know is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, any word putting A in position 3 is bad.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid position 3 for A, as well as position 2 for R.\n\nNow, R must appear in positions 3,4, or 5—but be aware that position 3 R might be fine since we didn\'t test it.\n\nSimilarly, A must be in positions 2,4, or 5.\n\nSo let\'s generate words starting with C, containing A and R, avoiding N/E:\n\n- CAMRA? Not sure that\'s a word.\n\nMore common: ""CARTA""? Not English. ""CAROL""? Positions: C-A-R-O-L. Position 1:C, position2:A, position3:R, ... Wait, put R in position 3—which we suspect might be possible. Also, position 3 R hasn\'t been tested. Position 2 A: A was tried only in position 3 before—position 2 hasn\'t been tested for A. Similarly, O and L are new.\n\nCAROL: positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=O, 5=L.\n\nBut CARTA? No. How about CARDS? Starts with C-A-R-D-S? Avoid E? Yes.\n\nCARDS: C in 1, A in 2, R in 3, D and S new.\n\nBut we have to confirm CARLY? CAROB—C-A-R-O-B, meaning a carob tree? CARBS—carbohydrates? But those are valid words.\n\nBack to CAROL: C-A-R-O-L.\n\nIf CAROL:\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓ (fixed).\nPosition 2 A: This is the first time we\'re testing A in position 2—could be ✓, -, or x? We don\'t know—but A is in the word according to first guess, just not position 3, so position 2 is possible. Alternatively, it could still be incorrect and A might be in position 4/5.\nPosition 3 R: Similarly, position 3 R—previously R was in position 2 and wrong, but position 3 R hasn\'t been tested—could be correct or misplaced.\nPosition 4 O: new letter—unknown.\nPosition 5 L: new letter—unknown.\n\nThus, guessing CAROL might give me more feedback about where A and R belong.\n\nBut CAROL has A and R in positions that could be verified.\n\nAnother solid word: ""CRAMP""—C-R-A-M-P? Positions: C-R-A-M-P.\n\nPosition 1 C: ✓\nPosition 2 R: Earlier feedback told us that R cannot be in position 2—because it was guessed there and got -. Therefore, if I place R again in position 2, it would get marked as ""-"" again? Or perhaps the symbol would change? Maybe it reiterates that R is misplaced.\n\nBut actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, guessing ""CRAMP"" puts R in position 2 again—which is inefficient—we already know that’s invalid.\n\nThus, I should avoid words with R in positions that are disallowed—in this case, position 2.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A in position 3.\n\nThus, for my next guess, I should place R in position 3,4, or 5—and A in position 2,4, or 5—avoiding position 3 for A.\n\nPosition 2 A hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.\n\nPosition 3 R hasn’t been tried—could be correct? Unknown.\n\nNow, optimizing for new letters: include common consonants like T, L, S, etc., and vowels not eliminated—since E is out, O and I and U are possible.\n\nWith C fixed, word starting with C, second letter being A (untested position), third being R (untested) BUT R could actually be in third position? Or elsewhere.\n\nAlternative: Place R in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits.\n\nSimilarly, place A in positions not tried.\n\nTo maximize information, pick a word that tests possible positions.\n\nSuggested word: ""CHAIR"" — starts with C, then H-A-I-R? Chair has H, A, I, R.\n\nPositions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=A — but wait! Position 3: A. Earlier we know A was misplaced in position 3—so avoid putting A in position 3. Guess chair has A in position 3—invalid move? Because it violates the feedback—we know A isn\'t in position 3.\n\nSo discard words with A in position 3.\n\nCHAIR: positions C-H-A-I-R—A is in position 3—avoid.\n\nWhat about CHART? C-H-A-R-T—A in position 3—avoid.\n\nCARAT: C-A-R-A-T—positions:1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A, 5=T.\n\nA is in position 2 and position 4. Position 2 A: not tested before? Position 3 R: not tested? Position 5 T: not tested.\n\nBut duplicate A? Wordle hints—if the word has two A’s? Possible.\n\nCARAT: valid word meaning unit of mass for gems.\n\nIf CARAT:\n\nPosition 1: C ✓ (given).\nPosition 2: A – possible? Since position 3 A was -, meaning A should exist elsewhere—could be position 2 or 4 or 5.\nPosition 3: R – previously R was in position 2 and got -, meaning R exists elsewhere—so could be position 3? If R is in position 3 for CARAT, could be ✓? \nPosition 4: A – also possible? Position 5: T – x? \n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nBetter to guess CARAT? Not ideal; it has two As and we won\'t know which one is right.\n\nInstead, pick a word without duplicates and test new letters.\n\nIdeal word: Starts with C (pos1 ✓), includes R (pos3-5), A (pos2,4,5), and other letters like T, L, O.\n\nPossible: CASTS? Duplicate S—no.\n\nCROWN? Starts C-R-O-W-N—but R in position 2—avoid because position 2 R was incorrect.\n\nAvoid R in position 2.\n\nTherefore, CROWN not good.\n\nCORAL: C-O-R-A-L—positions: C in1, O in2, R in3, A in4, L in5.\n\nThis seems good:\n\n- Position1: C ✓ (definitely).\n- Position2: O – new letter! Could be useful.\n- Position3: R – testing R in position 3—since it hasn\'t been tested there. Previously, R was in position 2 and got -, meaning it’s misplaced—so position 3 R could be ✓? \n- Position4: A – testing A in position 4—new position compared to position 3 in crane.\n- Position5: L – new letter, useful.\n\nAlso, avoids disallowed positions: no R in position 2, and no A in position 3.\n\nWord ""CORAL"" is valid English—meaning an organism in the ocean.\n\nPlus, letters: O, R, A, L — O and L are fresh letters to test.\n\nThus, guessing CORAL maximizes information: tests O in position 2, R in position 3, A in position 4, L in position 5—which are all new positions for these letters, except the fixed C.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""CORAL"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- N and E are not in the word (x).\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word must start with C.\n- R must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is incorrect).\n- A must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is incorrect).\n- The word cannot contain N or E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need a word starting with C, containing R and A, excluding N and E.\n- To maximize information, I should test R and A in new untested positions and include new common letters.\n- ""CORAL"" fits well: \n  - Starts with C (position 1, correct).\n  - Places R in position 3 (new position to test).\n  - Places A in position 4 (new position to test).\n  - Introduces O (position 2) and L (position 5), common untouched letters.\n- This avoids putting R in position 2 or A in position 3 again.\n\n<guess>coral</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coral -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position; so R is in the word but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""coral""\n- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position; so A is in the word but not in position 4? But note: we already knew A is in the word and not in position 3, now we also know it\'s not in position 4)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\n1. The word starts with C (position 1).\n2. R is in position 3 (from the second guess).\n3. A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by C, and positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).\n4. The word does not contain: N, E, O, L.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know that the word has 5 letters and we have accounted for C (pos1), R (pos3), and A (somewhere). So we need to find the remaining two letters and the exact position of A.\n\nSince A is in position 2 or 5, we can consider two cases.\n\nWe also need to avoid the letters: N, E, O, L.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to test the position of A and also get information about the remaining two letters.\n\nWe know the word has the form: C _ R _ _ \nBut with A in either position 2 or 5.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n- If A is in position 2: then the word is C A R _ _\n- If A is in position 5: then the word is C _ R _ A\n\nWe need to find the two missing letters (for positions 4 and 5 in the first case, or positions 2 and 4 in the second case) and they must be letters that are not N, E, O, L.\n\nWe should choose a word that can help distinguish between these two cases and also test new common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit one of the patterns and use new letters.\n\nFirst, if we assume A is in position 2, then the word is C A R _ _. We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. We can try a word like ""CARDS"" but D and S are new, and we avoid E, O, L, N. But we don\'t know if D and S are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume A is in position 5, then the word is C _ R _ A. We need letters for positions 2 and 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which case it is. So we should design a guess that tests both possibilities.\n\nIdea: use a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct. If we put A in position 5, then we can have a word of the form C _ R _ A.\n\nFor example, consider ""CIRCA"". But ""CIRCA"" has C, I, R, C, A? Wait, ""CIRCA"" is spelled C-I-R-C-A. But we have two C\'s? The secret word might have only one C? We don\'t know. The feedback for ""crane"" had C in position 1 correct, but that doesn\'t say anything about duplicate C. Similarly, in ""coral"", C was correct and no other C was present. But we can\'t rule out duplicates.\n\nHowever, ""CIRCA"" has C in position 1 and 4. But position 1 is fixed as C, so if we guess ""CIRCA"", then:\n- Position 1: C (should be correct)\n- Position 2: I (unknown)\n- Position 3: R (we know is correct, so ✓)\n- Position 4: C (if the secret word has C in position 4? We don\'t know)\n- Position 5: A (we are testing if A is in position 5)\n\nBut if the secret word doesn\'t have a second C, then position 4 would be marked as x (if C is not in the word) or - (if C is in the word but not position 4). But we already have C in position 1, so if there is only one C, then position 4 C would be x.\n\nBut we are trying to test A in position 5. Also, we are introducing I.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t have duplicate C. Let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARES"" but E is not allowed (from first guess, E is x). So avoid E.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nAvailable letters: we have to avoid N, E, O, L.\n\nCommon letters left: T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me try to form words for the two cases.\n\nCase 1: A in position 2 -> word: C A R _ _\nWe need two letters for positions 4 and 5. Possible words: CARTS, CARDS, CARPS, CARPI, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know which.\n\nCase 2: A in position 5 -> word: C _ R _ A\nWe need letters for positions 2 and 4. Possible words: CIRCA (but duplicate C), TERRA (but duplicate R and T not tested), or words like CRAWL (but W and L, L is not allowed), etc.\n\nWe need to test the position of A. So let\'s choose a word that has A in position 5. If we do that and A is indeed in position 5, then we get a ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2.\n\nSo, for the next guess, I\'ll put A in position 5 and use new letters for the other positions.\n\nThe word must start with C, have R in position 3 (we know that\'s fixed, so we can keep it), and A in position 5. Then position 2 and 4 are to be filled with new letters.\n\nSo pattern: C _ R _ A\n\nWe need to choose two letters for positions 2 and 4 that are not N, E, O, L and are common.\n\nPossible words:\n- CIRCA (but duplicate C, and we don\'t know if C is duplicated) -> not ideal.\n- CRAVA? Not a word.\n- CRUDA? Not common.\n- CRWTH? Not common.\n\nBetter words:\n- CRUSH: but U, S, H. But position 5 is H? We want A in position 5. CRUSH ends with H.\n\nWe need to end with A.\n\nWords ending with A: \n- ULTRA? But doesn\'t start with C.\n- Starting with C and ending with A: CAMPA? Not word. \n- CORDA? But O is not allowed (we know O is not in the word).\n- COUPA? Not word.\n\nCommon words: \n- CIRCA: C-I-R-C-A -> but duplicate C.\n- COBRA: but O is not allowed (from coral, O is x).\n- CAPSA? Not word.\n\nPerhaps: CRUST? Doesn\'t end with A.\n\nWe need a word that ends with A and has C at start and R at position 3.\n\nList: \n- CHINA: but H, I, N. N is not allowed (from crane, N is x). So no.\n- CHERA? Not word.\n- CEDAR: but E is not allowed (from crane, E is x). \n- CIGAR: G and A. Position 5 is A? C-I-G-A-R -> positions: 1=C, 2=I, 3=G, 4=A, 5=R. But we need R in position 3? Here R is in position 5. So not.\n\nWe need R in position 3.\n\nSo: position 1: C, position 3: R, position 5: A.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: C ? R ? A\n\nNow, what words are there? \n- CIRCA: C I R C A -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:R, 4:C, 5:A -> but duplicate C.\n- CURIA: C U R I A -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:I, 5:A -> this works, and no duplicate. U and I are new.\n\nIs CURIA a word? Yes, it means the papal court.\n\nAlso, we avoid N, E, O, L.\n\nSo CURIA: C, U, R, I, A.\n\nIf we guess CURIA:\n- Position 1: C -> ✓ (correct)\n- Position 2: U -> could be correct or not? We don\'t know.\n- Position 3: R -> ✓ (correct, we know)\n- Position 4: I -> could be correct or not?\n- Position 5: A -> we are testing if A is in position 5.\n\nIf A is in position 5, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be in position 2 (the only other possibility).\n\nAlso, we get feedback on U and I.\n\nAlternatively, we could test A in position 2. But let\'s stick with testing position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""CURVA"" - but not common, and V is new.\n\nBut CURIA is acceptable.\n\nTo avoid less common words, is there a more common word?\n\n""CARTA"" - not English.\n\n""CRENA"" - but N is not allowed.\n\n""CRIWA"" - not a word.\n\nSo CURIA is a valid choice.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has U or I.\n\nAnother common word: ""CRYPT"" doesn\'t end with A.\n\nI think CURIA is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if we guess CURIA and A is in position 5, then we get A✓ and we know the word ends with A. Then we only need to find position 2 and 4? But in CURIA, position 2 is U and position 4 is I. If they are correct, we are done. If not, we get feedback.\n\nIf A is not in position 5, then we know A must be in position 2, and we can focus on that.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has A in position 2 to test that case. For example, ""CARTE"" but E is not allowed.\n\n""CARDI"" - not common, and I is new.\n\n""CARTS"" - T and S.\n\nBut if we use ""CARTS"", which is C-A-R-T-S:\n- Position 1: C ✓\n- Position 2: A → if A is in position 2, then ✓, else if A is in position 5, then we get - (since A is in the word but not position 2) or x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it would be -.\n\nBut in ""CARTS"", we have A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, then we get ✓ for A. If not (i.e., if A is in position 5), then we get - for A (since A is in the word but not position 2). Also, we get feedback on T and S.\n\nBut we also have R in position 3, which is ✓.\n\nSo both approaches are valid.\n\nBut with ""CARTS"", we are testing A in position 2, and with ""CURIA"", we are testing A in position 5.\n\nWhich one to choose? We don\'t know which case is more likely, but we can choose based on word frequency or to maximize new letters.\n\nIn ""CARTS"", we introduce T and S, which are very common.\n\nIn ""CURIA"", we introduce U and I.\n\nT and S are more common than U and I, so ""CARTS"" might be better? But we have to avoid E, O, L, N.\n\nAlso, note that in ""CARTS"", if A is not in position 2, we get - for A and then we know A is in position 5. Then we can focus on that.\n\nSimilarly, with ""CURIA"", if A is not in position 5, we know A is in position 2.\n\nBut with ""CARTS"", we also test T and S, which are common.\n\nMoreover, ""CARTS"" is a common word.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CARTS"".\n\nBut wait, in ""CARTS"", position 2 is A. If A is in position 2, then we get ✓, and we know the word is C A R T S? But we don\'t know if T and S are correct.\n\nIf not, we get feedback.\n\nAlso, if A is not in position 2, we get - for A, meaning A is in position 5, and then we know the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? In ""CARTS"", positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:T, 5:S.\n\nSo if A is in position 5, then position 2 must be something else, and we have T and S in 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5.\n\nBut we get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? No, we can omit A to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we need to find A\'s position.\n\nWe must include A because it\'s in the word? Not necessarily, but if we don\'t include A, we might not get information about its position. But we can include it to get the position.\n\nI think including A is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CARTS"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""CARTS"" uses T and S, which are common and not excluded.\n\nAlso, it tests A in position 2.\n\nIf we get A✓, then we know the word is C A R _ _, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But we don\'t know if they are correct.\n\nIf we get A-, then we know A is in position 5, and the word is C _ R _ A, and we have T and S in positions 4 and 5? But position 5 is S, which would be wrong if A is in position 5, so S would be x or -? And T in position 4.\n\nBut we get feedback.\n\nAnother word: ""CAMPY"" but M, P, Y and A in position 2? But we don\'t know about M, P, Y.\n\nBut ""CAMPY"" is not as common.\n\nI think ""CARTS"" is fine.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had N and E excluded, and in the second, O and L excluded. So available letters: A, C, R (known), and others except N,E,O,L.\n\nSo T, S, I, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n""CARTS"" uses T and S.\n\nWe can also consider ""CARDS"", but D and S.\n\nBut ""CARTS"" is more common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CARTS"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid putting A in a position that might be wrong, we could use a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested and also has other letters.\n\nBut we have only two positions left for A: 2 or 5.\n\nSo testing one of them is good.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters. For example, ""CRWTH"" is not common and doesn\'t have A.\n\n""CRUST"" doesn\'t end with A.\n\nI think ""CURIA"" is acceptable, but let\'s go with ""CARTS"" for simplicity.\n\nBut ""CARTS"" has A in position 2, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nSo guess: ""CARTS""\n\nBut note: in ""CARTS"", we have S at the end. If the secret word has A in position 5, then S would be in position 5, which is not A, so S would be marked as x (if S not in word) or - (if S is in word but not position 5). But we don\'t know about S.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 4.\n\nBut we can get information.\n\nPerhaps a better word: ""CATTY"" but duplicate T and A in position 2? Not good.\n\nI think ""CARTS"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that has A in position 5 and is common. ""PIZZA"" doesn\'t start with C.\n\n""ULTRA"" doesn\'t start with C.\n\n""EXTRA"" doesn\'t start with C and has E.\n\n""ZEBRA"" has E and Z, not C.\n\nNot many common words ending with A and starting with C with R in position 3.\n\n""CORNU"" doesn\'t end with A.\n\nSo I think ""CARTS"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CARTS"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n  - C is correct and in position 1.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - N and E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**  \n  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  \n  - O is not in the word.  \n  - R is correct and in position 3 (now confirmed).  \n  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - L is not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **C** (position 1) and has **R** in **position 3**.  \n- **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, **A must be in position 2 or 5**.  \n- Excluded letters: **N, E, O, L** (not in the word).  \n- The word structure is:  \n  - **C _ R _ _** (with A in position 2 or 5).  \n- Remaining positions (2, 4, and 5) need to be filled, but position 2 or 5 will be A if not tested elsewhere.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test **A in position 2** to resolve its location (if A is in position 2, it will be ✓; if not, it must be in position 5).  \n- Introduce new common letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters (N, E, O, L).  \n- ""CARTS"" is a good choice:  \n  - Starts with C (position 1 ✓).  \n  - Places A in position 2 (to test if A is here).  \n  - Keeps R in position 3 (✓, confirmed).  \n  - Uses T (position 4) and S (position 5), which are common and not excluded.  \n- If A is in position 2, feedback will confirm, and we focus on positions 4–5. If A is not in position 2 (feedback: A(-)), then A must be in position 5, and we can adjust accordingly.\n\n<guess>carts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coral -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: carts -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is C)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""coral""
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 4)
- L: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""carts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct position, as we know)
- T: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining all information:

1. The word starts with C (position 1) and has A in position 2 and R in position 3. So the word is of the form: C A R _ _
2. We know the following letters are not in the word: N, E, O, L, T, S.
3. We need to find the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).

Since we have three letters confirmed and only two positions left, we can list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.

The word is: C A R ? ?

Excluded letters: N, E, O, L, T, S.

We need to choose two letters for positions 4 and 5 that are valid and form a real word.

Common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CARBY? Not a word.
- CARD: But CARD is 4 letters, we need 5.
- CARDI: Not common, but could be a root? Not standard.
- CARDS: But S is excluded (from guess 3, S is x).
- CARED: E is excluded.
- CARET: E and T excluded.
- CARGO: O excluded.
- CARRY: This is a word. C-A-R-R-Y. But we have R in position 3, and if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate R? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. In previous guesses, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

In ""carts"", we had no duplicate, but that doesn't rule out duplicates.

If we consider ""CARRY"":
- Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y
- But we have R in position 3 and 4. Is that allowed? The feedback from guess 1 had R in position 2 marked as ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not position 2. It didn't say anything about multiple R's. Similarly, in guess 2, R was in position 3 and marked ""✓"", which is consistent.

But in ""CARRY"", there are two R's. We need to see if it fits the feedback.

From guess 1: when we guessed ""crane"", R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", which is consistent with ""CARRY"" because R is in the word but not in position 2 (it's in 3 and 4). Similarly, in guess 2, ""coral"" had R in position 3, which is correct, and in ""CARRY"" position 3 is R, so that matches.

In guess 3, ""carts"" had R in position 3, correct.

Now, for A: in guess 1, A was in position 3 and marked ""-"", which is correct for ""CARRY"" because A is in position 2, not 3. In guess 2, A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which is also correct for ""CARRY"" because A is in position 2, not 4.

Excluded letters: N, E, O, L, T, S. ""CARRY"" has Y, which is not excluded.

So ""CARRY"" is a candidate.

Other possibilities:

- CARVY? Not a word.
- CARVY is not standard.
- CARPI: P and I. CARPI is a word (plural of carpus). C-A-R-P-I.
- CARPY? Not common.
- CAROM: O excluded.
- CAROB: O excluded.
- CAROL: O and L excluded.
- CARKS: K and S, but S excluded.
- CARK? Not 5 letters.
- CARBY not word.
- CARDS: S excluded.
- CARED: E excluded.
- CARET: E and T excluded.
- CARID: Not common.
- CARNY: N excluded.

Another common word: ""CARPY"" not word.

""CARDI"" not standard.

""CARGO"" O excluded.

""CARPE"" E excluded.

""CARPS"": S excluded? But S is excluded, so no.

""CARBO"": O excluded.

""CARDO"": O excluded.

""CARTA"": T excluded? T is excluded from guess 3.

In guess 3, T is x, so T is not in the word.

Similarly, S is x.

So ""CARTA"" has T, excluded.

""CARVY"" not word.

""CARZY"" not word.

""CARMY"" not word.

""CARHY"" not word.

""CARWY"" not word.

""CARVY"" not word.

Perhaps ""CARRY"" is the most common.

Another possibility: ""CABBY"" but B and Y, and position 3 is R? ""CABBY"" is C-A-B-B-Y, so position 3 is B, not R. We need position 3 to be R.

The word must have R in position 3.

So only position 4 and 5 are unknown.

Pattern: C A R ? ?

With ? not being N,E,O,L,T,S.

Possible combinations:

- Position 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

But they must form a valid English word.

Common words:

- CARRY: as above, with R in position 4? C-A-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R, position 5 is Y.

Is there another word? CARDI is not common.

CARPI: C-A-R-P-I. This is a valid word, meaning the plural of carpus (wrist bones). Or in botany, a part of a fruit.

CARPI: positions 4:P, 5:I.

P and I are not excluded.

Similarly, CARKS: but S excluded, and K is allowed, but CARKS has S? C-A-R-K-S, so S is excluded.

CARK: not 5 letters.

CARNS: N and S excluded.

CARNY: N excluded.

CAROB: O excluded.

CAROL: O and L excluded.

CAROM: O excluded.

CARPE: E excluded.

CARPS: S excluded.

CARED: E excluded.

CARET: E and T excluded.

CARTY: T excluded? T is excluded, and in ""carts"" T is x, so T not in word.

CARTY has T.

CARVY: not a word.

CABIN: N excluded, and position 3 is B, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So only possibilities: CARRY and CARPI.

CARPI is less common, but valid.

Another one: CARDS, but S excluded.

CARDI could be a root, but not a standalone word.

CARDO: O excluded.

CARID: not common.

CARAP: not 5 letters.

So likely candidates: CARRY and CARPI.

Now, we need to guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess one of them.

But we have 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 now.

We can guess ""CARRY"" because it's more common.

But let's see if we can get more information.

We know the word is C A R ? ?

We can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we only have two positions, so we can guess one candidate.

If we guess ""CARRY"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback and know it's ""CARPI"" or something else.

But what if there are more words?

Another word: ""CARVY""? Not word.

""CAREX"" E and X? E excluded.

""CARUM"" U and M? Not common word.

""CARNS"" N and S excluded.

I think CARRY and CARPI are the main options.

Perhaps ""CARBY"" not word.

""CARHY"" not word.

So let's go with ""CARRY"".

But in ""CARRY"", we have a duplicate R. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, as per feedback.

We can check the feedback consistency.

In guess 1: ""crane"" had R in position 2, marked ""-"", which is fine because in ""CARRY"", R is in positions 3 and 4, so position 2 is not R.

In guess 2: ""coral"" had R in position 3, marked ""✓"", correct.

In guess 3: ""carts"" had R in position 3, ""✓"", correct.

For A: in guess 1, A in position 3, marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

In guess 2, A in position 4, marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

Also, excluded letters are avoided.

So ""CARRY"" is a valid candidate.

Similarly, ""CARPI"": C-A-R-P-I.

Check feedback:

Guess 1: A in position 3, marked ""-"", but in CARPI, A is in position 2, so that's fine.

Guess 2: A in position 4, marked ""-"", and in CARPI, A is in position 2, so not position 4, fine.

R in position 3, correct.

Excluded letters: P and I are not excluded.

So both are possible.

But ""CARRY"" is more common, so I'll guess that.

We can also consider the frequency.

Since we have to guess, I'll go with ""CARRY"".

So the next guess is ""CARRY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - N and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - O is not in the word.  
  - R is correct and in position 3 (confirmed).  
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - L is not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""carts"" → C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).  
  - A is correct and in position 2 (newly confirmed).  
  - R is correct and in position 3 (confirmed).  
  - T is not in the word.  
  - S is not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **C A R _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as C, A, R).  
- Excluded letters: **N, E, O, L, T, S** (not in the word).  
- Only positions 4 and 5 need to be solved, with letters that are not excluded.  
- Possible candidates include ""CARRY"" (Y in position 5, with a duplicate R in position 4) or ""CARPI"" (P in position 4, I in position 5), but ""CARRY"" is more common and fits all feedback.  
- ""CARRY"" is tested as the next guess to potentially solve the word efficiently.  

<guess>carry</guess>",carry,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so first letter is C)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""coral""
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is in position 3)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 4)
- L: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""carts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct position, as we know)
- T: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

Now, combining all information:

1. The word starts with C (position 1) and has A in position 2 and R in position 3. So the word is of the form: C A R _ _
2. We know the following letters are not in the word: N, E, O, L, T, S.
3. We need to find the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).

Since we have three letters confirmed and only two positions left, we can list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters.

The word is: C A R ? ?

Excluded letters: N, E, O, L, T, S.

We need to choose two letters for positions 4 and 5 that are valid and form a real word.

Common letters that are not excluded: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CARBY? Not a word.
- CARD: But CARD is 4 letters, we need 5.
- CARDI: Not common, but could be a root? Not standard.
- CARDS: But S is excluded (from guess 3, S is x).
- CARED: E is excluded.
- CARET: E and T excluded.
- CARGO: O excluded.
- CARRY: This is a word. C-A-R-R-Y. But we have R in position 3, and if we put R in position 4, that would be a duplicate R? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. In previous guesses, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

In ""carts"", we had no duplicate, but that doesn't rule out duplicates.

If we consider ""CARRY"":
- Positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:R, 5:Y
- But we have R in position 3 and 4. Is that allowed? The feedback from guess 1 had R in position 2 marked as ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not position 2. It didn't say anything about multiple R's. Similarly, in guess 2, R was in position 3 and marked ""✓"", which is consistent.

But in ""CARRY"", there are two R's. We need to see if it fits the feedback.

From guess 1: when we guessed ""crane"", R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", which is consistent with ""CARRY"" because R is in the word but not in position 2 (it's in 3 and 4). Similarly, in guess 2, ""coral"" had R in position 3, which is correct, and in ""CARRY"" position 3 is R, so that matches.

In guess 3, ""carts"" had R in position 3, correct.

Now, for A: in guess 1, A was in position 3 and marked ""-"", which is correct for ""CARRY"" because A is in position 2, not 3. In guess 2, A was in position 4 and marked ""-"", which is also correct for ""CARRY"" because A is in position 2, not 4.

Excluded letters: N, E, O, L, T, S. ""CARRY"" has Y, which is not excluded.

So ""CARRY"" is a candidate.

Other possibilities:

- CARVY? Not a word.
- CARVY is not standard.
- CARPI: P and I. CARPI is a word (plural of carpus). C-A-R-P-I.
- CARPY? Not common.
- CAROM: O excluded.
- CAROB: O excluded.
- CAROL: O and L excluded.
- CARKS: K and S, but S excluded.
- CARK? Not 5 letters.
- CARBY not word.
- CARDS: S excluded.
- CARED: E excluded.
- CARET: E and T excluded.
- CARID: Not common.
- CARNY: N excluded.

Another common word: ""CARPY"" not word.

""CARDI"" not standard.

""CARGO"" O excluded.

""CARPE"" E excluded.

""CARPS"": S excluded? But S is excluded, so no.

""CARBO"": O excluded.

""CARDO"": O excluded.

""CARTA"": T excluded? T is excluded from guess 3.

In guess 3, T is x, so T is not in the word.

Similarly, S is x.

So ""CARTA"" has T, excluded.

""CARVY"" not word.

""CARZY"" not word.

""CARMY"" not word.

""CARHY"" not word.

""CARWY"" not word.

""CARVY"" not word.

Perhaps ""CARRY"" is the most common.

Another possibility: ""CABBY"" but B and Y, and position 3 is R? ""CABBY"" is C-A-B-B-Y, so position 3 is B, not R. We need position 3 to be R.

The word must have R in position 3.

So only position 4 and 5 are unknown.

Pattern: C A R ? ?

With ? not being N,E,O,L,T,S.

Possible combinations:

- Position 4: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

But they must form a valid English word.

Common words:

- CARRY: as above, with R in position 4? C-A-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R, position 5 is Y.

Is there another word? CARDI is not common.

CARPI: C-A-R-P-I. This is a valid word, meaning the plural of carpus (wrist bones). Or in botany, a part of a fruit.

CARPI: positions 4:P, 5:I.

P and I are not excluded.

Similarly, CARKS: but S excluded, and K is allowed, but CARKS has S? C-A-R-K-S, so S is excluded.

CARK: not 5 letters.

CARNS: N and S excluded.

CARNY: N excluded.

CAROB: O excluded.

CAROL: O and L excluded.

CAROM: O excluded.

CARPE: E excluded.

CARPS: S excluded.

CARED: E excluded.

CARET: E and T excluded.

CARTY: T excluded? T is excluded, and in ""carts"" T is x, so T not in word.

CARTY has T.

CARVY: not a word.

CABIN: N excluded, and position 3 is B, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So only possibilities: CARRY and CARPI.

CARPI is less common, but valid.

Another one: CARDS, but S excluded.

CARDI could be a root, but not a standalone word.

CARDO: O excluded.

CARID: not common.

CARAP: not 5 letters.

So likely candidates: CARRY and CARPI.

Now, we need to guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess one of them.

But we have 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 now.

We can guess ""CARRY"" because it's more common.

But let's see if we can get more information.

We know the word is C A R ? ?

We can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we only have two positions, so we can guess one candidate.

If we guess ""CARRY"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback and know it's ""CARPI"" or something else.

But what if there are more words?

Another word: ""CARVY""? Not word.

""CAREX"" E and X? E excluded.

""CARUM"" U and M? Not common word.

""CARNS"" N and S excluded.

I think CARRY and CARPI are the main options.

Perhaps ""CARBY"" not word.

""CARHY"" not word.

So let's go with ""CARRY"".

But in ""CARRY"", we have a duplicate R. Is that a problem? Not necessarily, as per feedback.

We can check the feedback consistency.

In guess 1: ""crane"" had R in position 2, marked ""-"", which is fine because in ""CARRY"", R is in positions 3 and 4, so position 2 is not R.

In guess 3: ""carts"" had R in position 3, ""✓"", correct.

For A: in guess 1, A in position 3, marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

In guess 2, A in position 4, marked ""-"", correct because A is in position 2.

Also, excluded letters are avoided.

So ""CARRY"" is a valid candidate.

Similarly, ""CARPI"": C-A-R-P-I.

Check feedback:

Guess 1: A in position 3, marked ""-"", but in CARPI, A is in position 2, so that's fine.

Guess 2: A in position 4, marked ""-"", and in CARPI, A is in position 2, so not position 4, fine.

R in position 3, correct.

Excluded letters: P and I are not excluded.

So both are possible.

But ""CARRY"" is more common, so I'll guess that.

We can also consider the frequency.

Since we have to guess, I'll go with ""CARRY"".

So the next guess is ""CARRY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.

  - N and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coral"" → C(✓) O(x) R(✓) A(-) L(x)**

  - L is not in the word.
