We're starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior feedback. 
 We want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, starting words have common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. They include common letters.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E.

 This gives us a good mix: two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Also, these letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to gather maximum information. The goal is to cover frequent vowels and consonants. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- None of these letters repeat, maximizing unique letter coverage.

This guess will likely reveal whether any of these 5 important letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. Though other words like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also strong, ""CRANE"" is a well-balanced choice for initial feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For our next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common letters in English that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible while placing 'A' in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A': since it was in position 3 in the first guess and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

Some ideas:
- We could try 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- We need to avoid E, so let's think of words without E.

Another idea: try 'A' in the second position? Or fourth?

We also want to test other vowels and common consonants.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try to put 'A' in a position we haven't tested, such as position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have only tried position 3 for 'A'. So we can try a different position.

Let me list some candidate words:

- With 'A' in position 1: 
  - ""APPLE"" -> but has P and L, but also E (which is invalid) -> not allowed because E is out.
  - ""ALPHA"" -> has H and P, but also A twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try. However, we have to avoid E, R, N, C. So ""ALPHA"" uses A, L, P, H. That seems okay? But we don't know if H is in the word. Also, we are testing L, P, H.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> has U, D, I, O. But we haven't tested these. However, it has O and I which are common. But note: we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But ""AUDIO"" has 'A' in first position and then U, D, I, O.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A' that is not in position 3. It could be in position 1? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try 'A' in position 2.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has S, A, L, D. But also two A's and two D's? And it has L and D. But we also have S. However, ""SALAD"" has an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are testing S, A, L, D.

But note: we are limited by the fact that we cannot use C, R, N, E.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" -> has P, A, S, T. And two A's? But again, we don't know. But it avoids forbidden letters.

But let's think about maximizing information. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

We should try to include several of these.

A good candidate might be ""SLATE"" but that has E -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

So avoid E.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but has N and T. But N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's think of words without these.

We can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

I am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is common.

Another idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.

But we are also placing 'A' in the second position.

Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's, but it's possible.

But we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.

But we only know that there is at least one 'A'. If the word has two A's, that's fine.

But we are using two A's in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had 'A' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put 'A' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting 'A' in position 3.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has 'A' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""PLAIT"" has 'A' in position 3 -> not good.

How about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no 'A'. We must include 'A' because we know it's in the word.

So we must include 'A'.

Let me try to form a word with 'A' in position 1: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A's and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.
- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that's possible.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it's there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.

Another: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.

So avoid E.

Position 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.

""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z's.

""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.

So we must avoid R.

Therefore, let's list some words that:
- Include 'A' (not in position 3)
- Do not include C, R, N, E
- Use common letters

Some options:

1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).

2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.

3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.

4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.

5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). This is good.

6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.

Among these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.

But we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven't tested.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.

Alternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so if the word only has one A, we might get a '-' for one A and an 'x' for the other? But that's okay.

But to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.

Similarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.

But we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.

In terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.

In ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.

In ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.

The difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.

Since we don't have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.

But let's look at letter frequencies in English:

- S, T, L, O, I are very common.

In ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.

In ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.

In ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so we are only testing three new letters.

I think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.

Another word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.

So avoid N.

How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.

""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.

""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.

""MAILS"" seems good: 
- M: new
- A: known, in position 2 (new position)
- I: new
- L: new
- S: new

And it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.

But ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.

Both are good.

""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.

But we can choose one.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.

But Y is less common.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.

But let's see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.

We could also try position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 2 is a common position for A.

So I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.

But ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.

""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.

B is not very common.

Whereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.

I think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.

But both are fine.

Let me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.

This way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.

And we avoid C, R, N, E.

So I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.

Similarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked 'x').
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' (since it's in the secret word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.
- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:
  - It includes 'A' in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
  - It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct position of 'A' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)

- The letter 'A' is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).

We can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

I am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is common.

Another idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.

But we are also placing 'A' in the second position.

Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's, but it's possible.

But we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.

But we only know that there is at least one 'A'. If the word has two A's, that's fine.

But we are using two A's in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had 'A' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put 'A' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting 'A' in position 3.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has 'A' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""PLAIT"" has 'A' in position 3 -> not good.

How about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no 'A'. We must include 'A' because we know it's in the word.

So we must include 'A'.

Let me try to form a word with 'A' in position 1: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A's and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.
- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that's possible.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it's there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.

Another: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.

So avoid E.

Position 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.

""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z's.

""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.

So we must avoid R.

Therefore, let's list some words that:
- Include 'A' (not in position 3)
- Do not include C, R, N, E
- Use common letters

Some options:

1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).

2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.

3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.

4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.

5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). This is good.

6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.

Among these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.

But we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven't tested.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.

Alternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so if the word only has one A, we might get a '-' for one A and an 'x' for the other? But that's okay.

But to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.

Similarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.

But we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.

In terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.

In ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.

In ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.

The difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.

Since we don't have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.

But let's look at letter frequencies in English:

- S, T, L, O, I are very common.

In ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.

In ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.

In ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so we are only testing three new letters.

I think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.

Another word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.

So avoid N.

How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.

""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.

""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.

""MAILS"" seems good: 
- M: new
- A: known, in position 2 (new position)
- I: new
- L: new
- S: new

And it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.

But ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.

Both are good.

""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.

But we can choose one.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.

But Y is less common.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.

But let's see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.

We could also try position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 2 is a common position for A.

So I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.

But ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.

""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.

B is not very common.

Whereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.

I think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.

But both are fine.

Let me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.

This way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.

And we avoid C, R, N, E.

So I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.

Similarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked 'x').
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' (since it's in the secret word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.
- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:
  - It includes 'A' in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
  - It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct position of 'A' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.",Guess 2: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(x) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We're starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior feedback. 
 We want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, starting words have common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. They include common letters.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E.

 This gives us a good mix: two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Also, these letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to gather maximum information. The goal is to cover frequent vowels and consonants. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- None of these letters repeat, maximizing unique letter coverage.

This guess will likely reveal whether any of these 5 important letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. Though other words like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also strong, ""CRANE"" is a well-balanced choice for initial feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For our next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common letters in English that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible while placing 'A' in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A': since it was in position 3 in the first guess and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

Some ideas:
- We could try 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- We need to avoid E, so let's think of words without E.

Another idea: try 'A' in the second position? Or fourth?

We also want to test other vowels and common consonants.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try to put 'A' in a position we haven't tested, such as position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have only tried position 3 for 'A'. So we can try a different position.

Let me list some candidate words:

- With 'A' in position 1: 
  - ""APPLE"" -> but has P and L, but also E (which is invalid) -> not allowed because E is out.
  - ""ALPHA"" -> has H and P, but also A twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try. However, we have to avoid E, R, N, C. So ""ALPHA"" uses A, L, P, H. That seems okay? But we don't know if H is in the word. Also, we are testing L, P, H.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> has U, D, I, O. But we haven't tested these. However, it has O and I which are common. But note: we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But ""AUDIO"" has 'A' in first position and then U, D, I, O.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A' that is not in position 3. It could be in position 1? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try 'A' in position 2.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has S, A, L, D. But also two A's and two D's? And it has L and D. But we also have S. However, ""SALAD"" has an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are testing S, A, L, D.

But note: we are limited by the fact that we cannot use C, R, N, E.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" -> has P, A, S, T. And two A's? But again, we don't know. But it avoids forbidden letters.

But let's think about maximizing information. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

We should try to include several of these.

A good candidate might be ""SLATE"" but that has E -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

So avoid E.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but has N and T. But N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's think of words without these.

We can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

I am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is common.

Another idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.

But we are also placing 'A' in the second position.

Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's, but it's possible.

But we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.

But we only know that there is at least one 'A'. If the word has two A's, that's fine.

But we are using two A's in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had 'A' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put 'A' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting 'A' in position 3.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has 'A' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""PLAIT"" has 'A' in position 3 -> not good.

How about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no 'A'. We must include 'A' because we know it's in the word.

So we must include 'A'.

Let me try to form a word with 'A' in position 1: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A's and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.
- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that's possible.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it's there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.

Another: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.

So avoid E.

Position 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.

""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z's.

""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.

So we must avoid R.

Therefore, let's list some words that:
- Include 'A' (not in position 3)
- Do not include C, R, N, E
- Use common letters

Some options:

1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).

2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.

3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.

4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.

5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). This is good.

6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.

Among these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.

But we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven't tested.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.

Alternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so if the word only has one A, we might get a '-' for one A and an 'x' for the other? But that's okay.

But to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.

Similarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.

But we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.

In terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.

In ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.

In ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.

The difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.

Since we don't have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.

But let's look at letter frequencies in English:

- S, T, L, O, I are very common.

In ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.

In ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.

In ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so we are only testing three new letters.

I think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.

Another word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.

So avoid N.

How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.

""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.

""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.

""MAILS"" seems good: 
- M: new
- A: known, in position 2 (new position)
- I: new
- L: new
- S: new

And it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.

But ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.

Both are good.

""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.

But we can choose one.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.

But Y is less common.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.

But let's see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.

We could also try position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 2 is a common position for A.

So I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.

But ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.

""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.

B is not very common.

Whereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.

I think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.

But both are fine.

Let me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.

This way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.

And we avoid C, R, N, E.

So I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.

Similarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked 'x').
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' (since it's in the secret word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.
- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:
  - It includes 'A' in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
  - It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct position of 'A' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.

Include the letter \'A\' (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position.\n2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nCommon letters in English that we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible while placing \'A\' in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for \'A\': since it was in position 3 in the first guess and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have \'A\' and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSome ideas:\n- We could try \'A\' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.\n- We need to avoid E, so let\'s think of words without E.\n\nAnother idea: try \'A\' in the second position? Or fourth?\n\nWe also want to test other vowels and common consonants.\n\nSince we know \'A\' is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try to put \'A\' in a position we haven\'t tested, such as position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we have only tried position 3 for \'A\'. So we can try a different position.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- With \'A\' in position 1: \n  - ""APPLE"" -> but has P and L, but also E (which is invalid) -> not allowed because E is out.\n  - ""ALPHA"" -> has H and P, but also A twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try. However, we have to avoid E, R, N, C. So ""ALPHA"" uses A, L, P, H. That seems okay? But we don\'t know if H is in the word. Also, we are testing L, P, H.\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" -> has U, D, I, O. But we haven\'t tested these. However, it has O and I which are common. But note: we are avoiding E, so that\'s okay. But ""AUDIO"" has \'A\' in first position and then U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has an \'A\' that is not in position 3. It could be in position 1? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try \'A\' in position 2.\n\nFor example: ""SALAD"" -> but has S, A, L, D. But also two A\'s and two D\'s? And it has L and D. But we also have S. However, ""SALAD"" has an \'A\' in position 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are testing S, A, L, D.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the fact that we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" -> has P, A, S, T. And two A\'s? But again, we don\'t know. But it avoids forbidden letters.\n\nBut let\'s think about maximizing information. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\nWe should try to include several of these.\n\nA good candidate might be ""SLATE"" but that has E -> not allowed because E is not in the word.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but has N and T. But N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s think of words without these.\n\nWe can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nI am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is common.\n\nAnother idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T\'s. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.\n\nBut we are also placing \'A\' in the second position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting \'A\' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.\n\nBut we only know that there is at least one \'A\'. If the word has two A\'s, that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are using two A\'s in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting \'A\' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had \'A\' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put \'A\' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid putting \'A\' in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that has \'A\' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" has \'A\' in position 3 -> not good.\n\nHow about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no \'A\'. We must include \'A\' because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo we must include \'A\'.\n\nLet me try to form a word with \'A\' in position 1: \n- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A\'s and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.\n- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that\'s possible.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has an \'A\', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it\'s there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with \'A\' in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.\n\nAnother: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nPosition 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.\n\n""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z\'s.\n\n""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.\n\nSo we must avoid R.\n\nTherefore, let\'s list some words that:\n- Include \'A\' (not in position 3)\n- Do not include C, R, N, E\n- Use common letters\n\nSome options:\n\n1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).\n\n2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.\n\n3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.\n\n4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.\n\n5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested). This is good.\n\n6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.\n\nAmong these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.\n\nHowever, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven\'t tested.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has two A\'s, so if the word only has one A, we might get a \'-\' for one A and an \'x\' for the other? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.\n\nIn terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.\n\nIn ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.\n\nThe difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.\n\nBut let\'s look at letter frequencies in English:\n\n- S, T, L, O, I are very common.\n\nIn ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.\n\nIn ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has two A\'s, so we are only testing three new letters.\n\nI think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nHow about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.\n\n""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.\n\n""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.\n\n""MAILS"" seems good: \n- M: new\n- A: known, in position 2 (new position)\n- I: new\n- L: new\n- S: new\n\nAnd it\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.\n\nBut ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.\n\nBoth are good.\n\n""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.\n\nBut we can choose one.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.\n\nWe could also try position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nBut position 2 is a common position for A.\n\nSo I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.\n\n""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.\n\nB is not very common.\n\nWhereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.\n\nI think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nLet me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nThis way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TAILS"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked \'x\').\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked \'-\').\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include \'A\' (since it\'s in the secret word) but avoid position 3.\n- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.\n- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:\n  - It includes \'A\' in position 2 (a new position to test).\n  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n  - It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify the correct position of \'A\' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""tails""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, the 'A' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We have used 9 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We know the word has an 'A' in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes 'A' in one of the positions 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We can use A, and other letters not in the forbidden set. The forbidden set is {C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S}.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters, and we know one of them is A.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ _ _ A

We should try to test A in a position we haven't tried before. We've tried position 2 and 3, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A in position 1, 4, or 5 and use common available letters.

Option 1: A in position 1.
- Example: ""ABOUT"" — but we have T and we know T is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""ADOBE"" — has E, which is forbidden. Also, E is not in the word.
- ""ADAPT"" — has T, forbidden.
- ""AGAPE"" — has E, forbidden.
- ""ALARM"" — has L and R, both forbidden.

We must avoid T, I, L, S, etc.

So for position 1: 
- ""ABHOR"" — has B, H, O, R. But R is forbidden. Invalid.
- ""ABYSS"" — has S and S, but S is forbidden.
- ""ADMIT"" — has D, M, I, T. But I and T are forbidden.
- ""ADOPT"" — has D, O, P, T. T is forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 1 without using forbidden letters.

Try A in position 4:
- Example: ""FOCAL"" — has C and L, both forbidden.
- ""VITAL"" — has T and L, both forbidden.
- ""OPTAL"" — not a word.
- ""MANGA"" — has M, A, N, G, A. But N is forbidden. Also, two A's? But N is out.
- ""DELTA"" — has D, E, L, T, A. But E, L, T are forbidden.

A in position 5:
- ""PIZZA"" — has P, I, Z, Z, A. But I is forbidden.
- ""KARMA"" — has K, A, R, M, A. But R is forbidden.
- ""DOGMA"" — has D, O, G, M, A. This might work? Letters: D, O, G, M, A. None of these are in the forbidden list? 
  Forbidden: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S. So D, O, G, M are allowed.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word. It has A in position 5.

We can also try other words.

Another word: ""MAGMA"" — has M, A, G, M, A. But we are testing M, A, G. And A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is not in position 2 (from second guess). So if we put A in position 2, it would be wrong. But in ""MAGMA"", we have A in position 2 and 5. We know A is not in position 2, so that would be a waste. We should avoid putting A in position 2.

So ""DOGMA"" has A only in position 5, which is good.

Another option: ""PAGAN"" — has P, A, G, A, N. But N is forbidden.

""DOGMA"" seems good: D, O, G, M, A.

We are testing D, O, G, M, and A in position 5.

We know A is in the word, so we are using one spot for A and testing four new letters.

But we are putting A in position 5, which is a new position (we haven't tried 5 before).

We could also try A in position 4.

For example: ""VOILA"" — but has V, O, I, L, A. I and L are forbidden.

""GUAVA"" — has G, U, A, V, A. But A is in position 3 and 5? We know position 3 is invalid for A, so position 3 would be wrong. Also, we are testing G, U, V. But we have two A's.

But we can try.

However, ""DOGMA"" seems better because it uses more common letters? G and M are medium, D and O are common.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" — not common, and has S? No, A, B, Y, S, M. S is forbidden.

""JUMBO"" — no A.

We need A.

""COMA"" is 4 letters.

""DOGMA"" is 5 letters.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" — has Z, E, N. E and N are forbidden.

""DOGMA"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can get a word with A in position 1 without forbidden letters.

""AGLOW"" — has G, L, O, W. But L is forbidden.

""AGONE"" — has G, O, N, E. N and E forbidden.

""AHOLD"" — has H, O, L, D. L is forbidden.

It's difficult. So position 1 might not be easy.

Position 4: ""ULTRA"" — has U, L, T, R, A. L, T, R forbidden.

""OMEGA"" — has M, E, G, A. E forbidden.

""DELTA"" — forbidden letters.

So position 4 is also hard.

Therefore, position 5 might be the easiest for now.

Another word: ""MAMBA"" — has M, A, M, B, A. A in position 2 and 5. But we know position 2 is wrong for A, so we would get a '-' for position 2? But we already know A is not in position 2, so it would be a waste. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""MAMBA"", A is in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are effectively only testing position 5 for A, and the other letters M and B.

But we are using two spots for A, which might not be efficient.

""DOGMA"" has only one A, in position 5.

Similarly, ""DOUMA"" — not a common word.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOULA"" — has O, U, L, A. But L is forbidden.

""DIARY"" — has D, I, A, R, Y. I and R forbidden.

""DAISY"" — has D, A, I, S, Y. I and S forbidden.

So ""DOGMA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""GAMMA"" — but A in position 2 and 5? We know position 2 is wrong, so same issue.

""PHASE"" — has P, H, A, S, E. S and E forbidden.

So I think ""DOGMA"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, we'll guess ""DOGMA"".

But let's confirm the letters: D, O, G, M, A.

- D: new
- O: new
- G: new
- M: new
- A: known, in position 5 (new position)

And we avoid all forbidden letters.

This should give us good information.

So the next guess is ""DOGMA"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1, where it was not in position 3).  
  - T, I, L, S are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - The secret word contains the letter **A**, but it is **not in position 2 or 3**. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
   - All other letters from previous guesses (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S) are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - The forbidden letters are: **C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S** (8 letters eliminated).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **A** in position 1, 4, or 5 (new positions to test).  
   - Avoid all excluded letters.  
   - Prioritize common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, O, G, M, P, U, Y).  
   - Focus on words with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.  

### Selection of Next Guess:
- **Chosen Guess: ""DOGMA""**  
  - **Why this word?**  
    - Includes **A in position 5** (a new position to test, as positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
    - Uses new common letters: **D, O, G, M** (all high-frequency and not previously tested).  
    - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S).  
    - Tests four new letters while leveraging the known presence of A.  
  - **Expected Information Gain**:  
    - Confirms if A is in position 5 (or rules it out).  
    - Reveals if D, O, G, or M are in the secret word and their positions.  
    - Narrows down possibilities significantly for subsequent guesses.  

<guess>dogma</guess>",dogma,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""tails""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, the 'A' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We have used 9 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We know the word has an 'A' in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes 'A' in one of the positions 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We can use A, and other letters not in the forbidden set. The forbidden set is {C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S}.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters, and we know one of them is A.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ _ _ A

We should try to test A in a position we haven't tried before. We've tried position 2 and 3, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A in position 1, 4, or 5 and use common available letters.

Option 1: A in position 1.
- Example: ""ABOUT"" — but we have T and we know T is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""ADOBE"" — has E, which is forbidden. Also, E is not in the word.
- ""ADAPT"" — has T, forbidden.
- ""AGAPE"" — has E, forbidden.
- ""ALARM"" — has L and R, both forbidden.

We must avoid T, I, L, S, etc.

So for position 1: 
- ""ABHOR"" — has B, H, O, R. But R is forbidden. Invalid.
- ""ABYSS"" — has S and S, but S is forbidden.
- ""ADMIT"" — has D, M, I, T. But I and T are forbidden.
- ""ADOPT"" — has D, O, P, T. T is forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 1 without using forbidden letters.

Try A in position 4:
- Example: ""FOCAL"" — has C and L, both forbidden.
- ""VITAL"" — has T and L, both forbidden.
- ""OPTAL"" — not a word.
- ""MANGA"" — has M, A, N, G, A. But N is forbidden. Also, two A's? But N is out.
- ""DELTA"" — has D, E, L, T, A. But E, L, T are forbidden.

A in position 5:
- ""PIZZA"" — has P, I, Z, Z, A. But I is forbidden.
- ""KARMA"" — has K, A, R, M, A. But R is forbidden.
- ""DOGMA"" — has D, O, G, M, A. This might work? Letters: D, O, G, M, A. None of these are in the forbidden list? 
  Forbidden: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S. So D, O, G, M are allowed.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word. It has A in position 5.

We can also try other words.

Another word: ""MAGMA"" — has M, A, G, M, A. But we are testing M, A, G. And A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is not in position 2 (from second guess). So if we put A in position 2, it would be wrong. But in ""MAGMA"", we have A in position 2 and 5. We know A is not in position 2, so that would be a waste. We should avoid putting A in position 2.

So ""DOGMA"" has A only in position 5, which is good.

Another option: ""PAGAN"" — has P, A, G, A, N. But N is forbidden.

""DOGMA"" seems good: D, O, G, M, A.

We are testing D, O, G, M, and A in position 5.

We know A is in the word, so we are using one spot for A and testing four new letters.

But we are putting A in position 5, which is a new position (we haven't tried 5 before).

We could also try A in position 4.

For example: ""VOILA"" — but has V, O, I, L, A. I and L are forbidden.

""GUAVA"" — has G, U, A, V, A. But A is in position 3 and 5? We know position 3 is invalid for A, so position 3 would be wrong. Also, we are testing G, U, V. But we have two A's.

But we can try.

However, ""DOGMA"" seems better because it uses more common letters? G and M are medium, D and O are common.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" — not common, and has S? No, A, B, Y, S, M. S is forbidden.

""JUMBO"" — no A.

We need A.

""COMA"" is 4 letters.

""DOGMA"" is 5 letters.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" — has Z, E, N. E and N are forbidden.

""DOGMA"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can get a word with A in position 1 without forbidden letters.

""AGLOW"" — has G, L, O, W. But L is forbidden.

""AGONE"" — has G, O, N, E. N and E forbidden.

""AHOLD"" — has H, O, L, D. L is forbidden.

It's difficult. So position 1 might not be easy.

Position 4: ""ULTRA"" — has U, L, T, R, A. L, T, R forbidden.

""OMEGA"" — has M, E, G, A. E forbidden.

""DELTA"" — forbidden letters.

So position 4 is also hard.

Therefore, position 5 might be the easiest for now.

Another word: ""MAMBA"" — has M, A, M, B, A. A in position 2 and 5. But we know position 2 is wrong for A, so we would get a '-' for position 2? But we already know A is not in position 2, so it would be a waste. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""MAMBA"", A is in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are effectively only testing position 5 for A, and the other letters M and B.

But we are using two spots for A, which might not be efficient.

""DOGMA"" has only one A, in position 5.

Similarly, ""DOUMA"" — not a common word.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOULA"" — has O, U, L, A. But L is forbidden.

""DIARY"" — has D, I, A, R, Y. I and R forbidden.

""DAISY"" — has D, A, I, S, Y. I and S forbidden.

So ""DOGMA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""GAMMA"" — but A in position 2 and 5? We know position 2 is wrong, so same issue.

""PHASE"" — has P, H, A, S, E. S and E forbidden.

So I think ""DOGMA"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, we'll guess ""DOGMA"".

But let's confirm the letters: D, O, G, M, A.

- D: new
- O: new
- G: new
- M: new
- A: known, in position 5 (new position)

And we avoid all forbidden letters.

This should give us good information.

So the next guess is ""DOGMA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1, where it was not in position 3).  
  - T, I, L, S are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - The secret word contains the letter **A**, but it is **not in position 2 or 3**. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
   - All other letters from previous guesses (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S) are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - The forbidden letters are: **C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S** (8 letters eliminated).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **A** in position 1, 4, or 5 (new positions to test).  
   - Avoid all excluded letters.  
   - Prioritize common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, O, G, M, P, U, Y).  
   - Focus on words with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.  

### Selection of Next Guess:
- **Chosen Guess: ""DOGMA""**  
  - **Why this word?**  
    - Includes **A in position 5** (a new position to test, as positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
    - Uses new common letters: **D, O, G, M** (all high-frequency and not previously tested).  
    - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S).  
    - Tests four new letters while leveraging the known presence of A.  
  - **Expected Information Gain**:  
    - Confirms if A is in position 5 (or rules it out).  
    - Reveals if D, O, G, or M are in the secret word and their positions.  
    - Narrows down possibilities significantly for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: dogma -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) G(x) M(x) A(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We're starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior feedback. 
 We want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, starting words have common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc. They include common letters.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E.

 This gives us a good mix: two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N). Also, these letters are among the most common in English.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common letters to gather maximum information. The goal is to cover frequent vowels and consonants. A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it contains:

- Common vowels: A, E
- Common consonants: C, R, N
- None of these letters repeat, maximizing unique letter coverage.

This guess will likely reveal whether any of these 5 important letters are in the secret word and their potential positions. Though other words like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also strong, ""CRANE"" is a well-balanced choice for initial feedback.
</thinking>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter 'A' is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' and does not contain C, R, N, or E.

For our next guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter 'A' (since we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.

We also want to maximize information by trying new common letters that we haven't tested yet.

Common letters in English that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible while placing 'A' in a different position.

Possible positions for 'A': since it was in position 3 in the first guess and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

Some ideas:
- We could try 'A' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.
- We need to avoid E, so let's think of words without E.

Another idea: try 'A' in the second position? Or fourth?

We also want to test other vowels and common consonants.

Since we know 'A' is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try to put 'A' in a position we haven't tested, such as position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have only tried position 3 for 'A'. So we can try a different position.

Let me list some candidate words:

- With 'A' in position 1: 
  - ""APPLE"" -> but has P and L, but also E (which is invalid) -> not allowed because E is out.
  - ""ALPHA"" -> has H and P, but also A twice? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try. However, we have to avoid E, R, N, C. So ""ALPHA"" uses A, L, P, H. That seems okay? But we don't know if H is in the word. Also, we are testing L, P, H.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> has U, D, I, O. But we haven't tested these. However, it has O and I which are common. But note: we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But ""AUDIO"" has 'A' in first position and then U, D, I, O.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A' that is not in position 3. It could be in position 1? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try 'A' in position 2.

For example: ""SALAD"" -> but has S, A, L, D. But also two A's and two D's? And it has L and D. But we also have S. However, ""SALAD"" has an 'A' in position 2 and 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are testing S, A, L, D.

But note: we are limited by the fact that we cannot use C, R, N, E.

Another common word: ""PASTA"" -> has P, A, S, T. And two A's? But again, we don't know. But it avoids forbidden letters.

But let's think about maximizing information. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

We should try to include several of these.

A good candidate might be ""SLATE"" but that has E -> not allowed because E is not in the word.

So avoid E.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but has N and T. But N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So let's think of words without these.

We can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

I am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is common.

Another idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.

But we are also placing 'A' in the second position.

Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. We don't know if the word has two A's, but it's possible.

But we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.

But we only know that there is at least one 'A'. If the word has two A's, that's fine.

But we are using two A's in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting 'A' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had 'A' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put 'A' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting 'A' in position 3.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has 'A' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""PLAIT"" has 'A' in position 3 -> not good.

How about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no 'A'. We must include 'A' because we know it's in the word.

So we must include 'A'.

Let me try to form a word with 'A' in position 1: 
- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A's and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.
- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that's possible.

But we know that the secret word has an 'A', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it's there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word with 'A' in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.

Another: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.

So avoid E.

Position 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.

""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.

Similarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z's.

""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.

So we must avoid R.

Therefore, let's list some words that:
- Include 'A' (not in position 3)
- Do not include C, R, N, E
- Use common letters

Some options:

1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).

2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.

3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.

4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.

5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven't tested). This is good.

6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.

Among these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.

However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.

But we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven't tested.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.

Alternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.

Similarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so if the word only has one A, we might get a '-' for one A and an 'x' for the other? But that's okay.

But to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.

Similarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.

But we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.

In terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.

In ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.

In ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.

The difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.

Since we don't have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.

But let's look at letter frequencies in English:

- S, T, L, O, I are very common.

In ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.

In ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.

In ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.

But ""PASTA"" has two A's, so we are only testing three new letters.

I think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.

Another word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.

So avoid N.

How about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.

""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.

""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.

""MAILS"" seems good: 
- M: new
- A: known, in position 2 (new position)
- I: new
- L: new
- S: new

And it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.

But ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.

Both are good.

""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.

But we can choose one.

Alternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.

But Y is less common.

I think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.

But let's see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.

We could also try position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 2 is a common position for A.

So I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.

Another option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.

But ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.

""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.

B is not very common.

Whereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.

Similarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.

I think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.

But both are fine.

Let me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.

This way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.

And we avoid C, R, N, E.

So I'll go with ""TAILS"".

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.

Similarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked 'x').
- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' (since it's in the secret word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.
- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:
  - It includes 'A' in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
  - It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct position of 'A' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""tails""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 2)
- I: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter 'A', but it is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, the 'A' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We have used 9 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.

We know the word has an 'A' in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.

We need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes 'A' in one of the positions 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We can use A, and other letters not in the forbidden set. The forbidden set is {C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S}.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters, and we know one of them is A.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: e.g., _ _ _ _ A

We should try to test A in a position we haven't tried before. We've tried position 2 and 3, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.

Additionally, we want to test other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A in position 1, 4, or 5 and use common available letters.

Option 1: A in position 1.
- Example: ""ABOUT"" — but we have T and we know T is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""ADOBE"" — has E, which is forbidden. Also, E is not in the word.
- ""ADAPT"" — has T, forbidden.
- ""AGAPE"" — has E, forbidden.
- ""ALARM"" — has L and R, both forbidden.

We must avoid T, I, L, S, etc.

So for position 1: 
- ""ABHOR"" — has B, H, O, R. But R is forbidden. Invalid.
- ""ABYSS"" — has S and S, but S is forbidden.
- ""ADMIT"" — has D, M, I, T. But I and T are forbidden.
- ""ADOPT"" — has D, O, P, T. T is forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 1 without using forbidden letters.

Try A in position 4:
- Example: ""FOCAL"" — has C and L, both forbidden.
- ""VITAL"" — has T and L, both forbidden.
- ""OPTAL"" — not a word.
- ""MANGA"" — has M, A, N, G, A. But N is forbidden. Also, two A's? But N is out.
- ""DELTA"" — has D, E, L, T, A. But E, L, T are forbidden.

A in position 5:
- ""PIZZA"" — has P, I, Z, Z, A. But I is forbidden.
- ""KARMA"" — has K, A, R, M, A. But R is forbidden.
- ""DOGMA"" — has D, O, G, M, A. This might work? Letters: D, O, G, M, A. None of these are in the forbidden list? 
  Forbidden: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S. So D, O, G, M are allowed.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word. It has A in position 5.

We can also try other words.

Another word: ""MAGMA"" — has M, A, G, M, A. But we are testing M, A, G. And A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is not in position 2 (from second guess). So if we put A in position 2, it would be wrong. But in ""MAGMA"", we have A in position 2 and 5. We know A is not in position 2, so that would be a waste. We should avoid putting A in position 2.

So ""DOGMA"" has A only in position 5, which is good.

Another option: ""PAGAN"" — has P, A, G, A, N. But N is forbidden.

""DOGMA"" seems good: D, O, G, M, A.

We are testing D, O, G, M, and A in position 5.

We know A is in the word, so we are using one spot for A and testing four new letters.

But we are putting A in position 5, which is a new position (we haven't tried 5 before).

We could also try A in position 4.

For example: ""VOILA"" — but has V, O, I, L, A. I and L are forbidden.

""GUAVA"" — has G, U, A, V, A. But A is in position 3 and 5? We know position 3 is invalid for A, so position 3 would be wrong. Also, we are testing G, U, V. But we have two A's.

But we can try.

However, ""DOGMA"" seems better because it uses more common letters? G and M are medium, D and O are common.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" — not common, and has S? No, A, B, Y, S, M. S is forbidden.

""JUMBO"" — no A.

We need A.

""COMA"" is 4 letters.

""DOGMA"" is 5 letters.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" — has Z, E, N. E and N are forbidden.

""DOGMA"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can get a word with A in position 1 without forbidden letters.

""AGLOW"" — has G, L, O, W. But L is forbidden.

""AGONE"" — has G, O, N, E. N and E forbidden.

""AHOLD"" — has H, O, L, D. L is forbidden.

It's difficult. So position 1 might not be easy.

Position 4: ""ULTRA"" — has U, L, T, R, A. L, T, R forbidden.

""OMEGA"" — has M, E, G, A. E forbidden.

""DELTA"" — forbidden letters.

So position 4 is also hard.

Therefore, position 5 might be the easiest for now.

Another word: ""MAMBA"" — has M, A, M, B, A. A in position 2 and 5. But we know position 2 is wrong for A, so we would get a '-' for position 2? But we already know A is not in position 2, so it would be a waste. We want to test a new position for A.

In ""MAMBA"", A is in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are effectively only testing position 5 for A, and the other letters M and B.

But we are using two spots for A, which might not be efficient.

""DOGMA"" has only one A, in position 5.

Similarly, ""DOUMA"" — not a common word.

""DOGMA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOULA"" — has O, U, L, A. But L is forbidden.

""DIARY"" — has D, I, A, R, Y. I and R forbidden.

""DAISY"" — has D, A, I, S, Y. I and S forbidden.

So ""DOGMA"" seems a good choice.

We can also consider ""GAMMA"" — but A in position 2 and 5? We know position 2 is wrong, so same issue.

""PHASE"" — has P, H, A, S, E. S and E forbidden.

So I think ""DOGMA"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, we'll guess ""DOGMA"".

But let's confirm the letters: D, O, G, M, A.

- D: new
- O: new
- G: new
- M: new
- A: known, in position 5 (new position)

And we avoid all forbidden letters.

This should give us good information.

So the next guess is ""DOGMA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - A is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1, where it was not in position 3).  
  - T, I, L, S are not in the secret word.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters**:  
   - The secret word contains the letter **A**, but it is **not in position 2 or 3**. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
   - All other letters from previous guesses (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S) are **absent** from the secret word.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - The forbidden letters are: **C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S** (8 letters eliminated).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include **A** in position 1, 4, or 5 (new positions to test).  
   - Avoid all excluded letters.  
   - Prioritize common unused letters to maximize information gain (e.g., D, O, G, M, P, U, Y).  
   - Focus on words with high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.  

### Selection of Next Guess:
- **Chosen Guess: ""DOGMA""**  
  - **Why this word?**  
    - Includes **A in position 5** (a new position to test, as positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).  
    - Uses new common letters: **D, O, G, M** (all high-frequency and not previously tested).  
    - Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S).  
    - Tests four new letters while leveraging the known presence of A.  
  - **Expected Information Gain**:  
    - Confirms if A is in position 5 (or rules it out).  
    - Reveals if D, O, G, or M are in the secret word and their positions.  
    - Narrows down possibilities significantly for subsequent guesses.

Include the letter \'A\' (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position.\n2. Avoid using the letters C, R, N, E.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by trying new common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nCommon letters in English that we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible while placing \'A\' in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for \'A\': since it was in position 3 in the first guess and was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have \'A\' and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSome ideas:\n- We could try \'A\' in the first position: e.g., ""ADIEU"" but that has E and we know E is not in the word. So avoid E.\n- We need to avoid E, so let\'s think of words without E.\n\nAnother idea: try \'A\' in the second position? Or fourth?\n\nWe also want to test other vowels and common consonants.\n\nSince we know \'A\' is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try to put \'A\' in a position we haven\'t tested, such as position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we have only tried position 3 for \'A\'. So we can try a different position.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\n- With \'A\' in position 1: \n  - ""APPLE"" -> but has P and L, but also E (which is invalid) -> not allowed because E is out.\n  - ""ALPHA"" -> has H and P, but also A twice? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try. However, we have to avoid E, R, N, C. So ""ALPHA"" uses A, L, P, H. That seems okay? But we don\'t know if H is in the word. Also, we are testing L, P, H.\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" -> has U, D, I, O. But we haven\'t tested these. However, it has O and I which are common. But note: we are avoiding E, so that\'s okay. But ""AUDIO"" has \'A\' in first position and then U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has an \'A\' that is not in position 3. It could be in position 1? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try \'A\' in position 2.\n\nFor example: ""SALAD"" -> but has S, A, L, D. But also two A\'s and two D\'s? And it has L and D. But we also have S. However, ""SALAD"" has an \'A\' in position 2 and 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are testing S, A, L, D.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the fact that we cannot use C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother common word: ""PASTA"" -> has P, A, S, T. And two A\'s? But again, we don\'t know. But it avoids forbidden letters.\n\nBut let\'s think about maximizing information. We want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\nWe should try to include several of these.\n\nA good candidate might be ""SLATE"" but that has E -> not allowed because E is not in the word.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but has N and T. But N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo let\'s think of words without these.\n\nWe can use: A, and then other letters from B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nI am considering ""SAULT"" but that might not be common. Or ""SALTY"" -> has S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is common.\n\nAnother idea: ""TASTY"" -> has T, A, S, T, Y -> two T\'s. But again, we are testing T, A, S, Y.\n\nBut we are also placing \'A\' in the second position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" as I thought earlier: P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut we are testing P, A, S, T. And we are putting \'A\' in position 2 and 5? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5.\n\nBut we only know that there is at least one \'A\'. If the word has two A\'s, that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are using two A\'s in our guess, which might not be efficient if the word only has one A. However, we are testing multiple positions.\n\nBut we have limited guesses, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PLAIT"" -> has P, L, A, I, T. This uses five new letters: P, L, A, I, T. And we are putting \'A\' in position 3? But wait, in the first guess we had \'A\' in position 3 and it was wrong position. So if we put \'A\' in position 3 again, it would be the same position and we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid putting \'A\' in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that has \'A\' in a new position: 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" has \'A\' in position 3 -> not good.\n\nHow about ""PILOT""? But that has O and T, but no \'A\'. We must include \'A\' because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo we must include \'A\'.\n\nLet me try to form a word with \'A\' in position 1: \n- ""ALPHA"" -> A, L, P, H, A -> but two A\'s and H. We are testing L, P, H. And we avoid forbidden letters.\n- ""ABOUT"" -> has B, O, U, T, but no A? Wait, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? No, ""ABOUT"" is A, B, O, U, T? Actually, ""ABOUT"" is A in position 1, then B, O, U, T. But we are testing A, B, O, U, T. And we avoid C, R, N, E. So that\'s possible.\n\nBut we know that the secret word has an \'A\', so we are confirming its presence again? But we already know it\'s there, so we might be wasting a spot. However, we are testing new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with \'A\' in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but has F, O, C, A, L -> but C is forbidden! We cannot use C.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo ""FOCAL"" is invalid because of C.\n\nAnother: ""MEDAL"" -> has M, E, D, A, L -> but E is forbidden.\n\nSo avoid E.\n\nPosition 4: ""OPTAL"" - not a word.\n\n""VITAL"" -> V, I, T, A, L -> has A in position 4. And letters V, I, T, A, L. All new, and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> has Z, which is less common, and two Z\'s.\n\n""KARMA"" -> has K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden! We cannot use R.\n\nSo we must avoid R.\n\nTherefore, let\'s list some words that:\n- Include \'A\' (not in position 3)\n- Do not include C, R, N, E\n- Use common letters\n\nSome options:\n\n1. ""AUDIO"" - A in pos1, U in pos2, D in pos3, I in pos4, O in pos5. Tests A, U, D, I, O. All new letters. And we are putting A in a new position (1). This is a good candidate because it tests four new vowels and a consonant (D).\n\n2. ""PASTA"" - P in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, A in pos5. Tests P, A, S, T. And we are testing A in two positions (2 and 5). But we are reusing A, so we are only testing three new letters: P, S, T.\n\n3. ""SALAD"" - S in pos1, A in pos2, L in pos3, A in pos4, D in pos5. Tests S, A, L, D. But reuses A, so three new letters: S, L, D.\n\n4. ""TASTY"" - T in pos1, A in pos2, S in pos3, T in pos4, Y in pos5. Tests T, A, S, Y. And reuses T? So we are testing T, S, Y and A. But T is repeated, so we are testing three new letters: T, S, Y.\n\n5. ""VITAL"" - V in pos1, I in pos2, T in pos3, A in pos4, L in pos5. Tests V, I, T, A, L. All new, and A in position 4 (which we haven\'t tested). This is good.\n\n6. ""ABOUT"" - A in pos1, B in pos2, O in pos3, U in pos4, T in pos5. Tests A, B, O, U, T. All new.\n\nAmong these, ""AUDIO"" and ""ABOUT"" are very common starting words for Wordle when you know A is in the word. But ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, which might be useful.\n\nHowever, we already know that the word has at least one vowel (A). But there might be more vowels.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have consonants we haven\'t tested.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests four new vowels and one consonant (D). But if the secret word has more consonants, we might not get much information about consonants.\n\nAlternatively, ""VITAL"" tests V, I, T, A, L -> which includes both vowels (I, A) and consonants (V, T, L). This might be better.\n\nSimilarly, ""PASTA"" tests P, A, S, T -> all common consonants except A.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has two A\'s, so if the word only has one A, we might get a \'-\' for one A and an \'x\' for the other? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, ""VITAL"" has five distinct new letters: V, I, T, A, L.\n\nSimilarly, ""AUDIO"" has five distinct new letters: A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word, so in ""AUDIO"", we are using one spot for a known letter. But we are testing it in a new position.\n\nIn terms of information, testing A in position 1 is new.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we have only one known letter (A) and we must include it. So we are going to use one spot for A in a new position and the other four for new letters.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", we are testing four new letters (U, D, I, O) and one known (A) in a new position.\n\nIn ""VITAL"", we are testing four new letters (V, I, T, L) and one known (A) in a new position.\n\nThe difference is the set of letters: ""AUDIO"" tests more vowels, ""VITAL"" tests a mix.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about other vowels or consonants, I think testing a mix might be better.\n\nBut let\'s look at letter frequencies in English:\n\n- S, T, L, O, I are very common.\n\nIn ""VITAL"": T, I, L are common. V is less common.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"": O, I are common, U and D are medium.\n\nIn ""PASTA"": P, S, T are common.\n\nBut ""PASTA"" has two A\'s, so we are only testing three new letters.\n\nI think ""PASTA"" is acceptable, but we are not testing as many new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SLANT"" -> but has S, L, A, N, T -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\nHow about ""PLAIT"" but we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n""PLAIT"" has A in position 3 -> avoid.\n\n""PAINT"" has N -> avoid.\n\n""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. Tests M, A, I, L, S. All new and common letters. And avoids forbidden letters.\n\n""MAILS"" seems good: \n- M: new\n- A: known, in position 2 (new position)\n- I: new\n- L: new\n- S: new\n\nAnd it\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TAILS"" -> T, A, I, L, S -> same idea.\n\nBut ""TAILS"" has T, A, I, L, S.\n\nBoth are good.\n\n""MAILS"" and ""TAILS"" are similar.\n\nBut we can choose one.\n\nAlternatively, ""SALTY"" -> S, A, L, T, Y -> A in position 2.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\nI think ""MAILS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the position of A: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are trying position 2.\n\nWe could also try position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nBut position 2 is a common position for A.\n\nSo I think ""MAILS"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother option: ""ABOUT"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut ""ABOUT"" has B and O, which are less common than S and T? Actually, T is very common.\n\n""ABOUT"" tests A, B, O, U, T.\n\nB is not very common.\n\nWhereas ""MAILS"" tests M, A, I, L, S -> all of which are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""TAILS"" tests T, A, I, L, S -> T is very common.\n\nI think ""TAILS"" might be slightly better because T is more common than M.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nLet me choose ""TAILS"": T in position 1, A in position 2, I in position 3, L in position 4, S in position 5.\n\nThis way, we are testing T, A, I, L, S.\n\nAnd we avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""TAILS"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know A is in the word, so if not in position 2, it will be a minus.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T, I, L, S in other positions.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is ""TAILS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word (marked \'x\').\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (marked \'-\').\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include \'A\' (since it\'s in the secret word) but avoid position 3.\n- Exclude C, R, N, E entirely.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I) to maximize information gain.\n- ""TAILS"" is chosen because:\n  - It includes \'A\' in position 2 (a new position to test).\n  - It introduces four new common letters: T, I, L, S.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n  - It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify the correct position of \'A\' and reveal whether T, I, L, or S are present in the secret word.\n\n<guess>tails</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: tails -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) I(x) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""tails""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see A is in the word but not in the position we guessed (position 2)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains the letter \'A\', but it is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, the \'A\' must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.\n\nWe have used 9 letters that are not in the word: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.\n\nWe know the word has an \'A\' in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to choose a new guess that:\n- Includes \'A\' in one of the positions 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S.\n- Uses new common letters to maximize information.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use A, and other letters not in the forbidden set. The forbidden set is {C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S}.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nWe want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nWe also note that the word must have 5 letters, and we know one of them is A.\n\nPossible positions for A:\n- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _\n- Position 4: e.g., _ _ _ A _\n- Position 5: e.g., _ _ _ _ A\n\nWe should try to test A in a position we haven\'t tried before. We\'ve tried position 2 and 3, so we can try position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 1, 4, or 5 and use common available letters.\n\nOption 1: A in position 1.\n- Example: ""ABOUT"" — but we have T and we know T is not in the word. So invalid.\n- ""ADOBE"" — has E, which is forbidden. Also, E is not in the word.\n- ""ADAPT"" — has T, forbidden.\n- ""AGAPE"" — has E, forbidden.\n- ""ALARM"" — has L and R, both forbidden.\n\nWe must avoid T, I, L, S, etc.\n\nSo for position 1: \n- ""ABHOR"" — has B, H, O, R. But R is forbidden. Invalid.\n- ""ABYSS"" — has S and S, but S is forbidden.\n- ""ADMIT"" — has D, M, I, T. But I and T are forbidden.\n- ""ADOPT"" — has D, O, P, T. T is forbidden.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 1 without using forbidden letters.\n\nTry A in position 4:\n- Example: ""FOCAL"" — has C and L, both forbidden.\n- ""VITAL"" — has T and L, both forbidden.\n- ""OPTAL"" — not a word.\n- ""MANGA"" — has M, A, N, G, A. But N is forbidden. Also, two A\'s? But N is out.\n- ""DELTA"" — has D, E, L, T, A. But E, L, T are forbidden.\n\nA in position 5:\n- ""PIZZA"" — has P, I, Z, Z, A. But I is forbidden.\n- ""KARMA"" — has K, A, R, M, A. But R is forbidden.\n- ""DOGMA"" — has D, O, G, M, A. This might work? Letters: D, O, G, M, A. None of these are in the forbidden list? \n  Forbidden: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S. So D, O, G, M are allowed.\n\n""DOGMA"" is a valid word. It has A in position 5.\n\nWe can also try other words.\n\nAnother word: ""MAGMA"" — has M, A, G, M, A. But we are testing M, A, G. And A is in position 2 and 5? But we know A is not in position 2 (from second guess). So if we put A in position 2, it would be wrong. But in ""MAGMA"", we have A in position 2 and 5. We know A is not in position 2, so that would be a waste. We should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nSo ""DOGMA"" has A only in position 5, which is good.\n\nAnother option: ""PAGAN"" — has P, A, G, A, N. But N is forbidden.\n\n""DOGMA"" seems good: D, O, G, M, A.\n\nWe are testing D, O, G, M, and A in position 5.\n\nWe know A is in the word, so we are using one spot for A and testing four new letters.\n\nBut we are putting A in position 5, which is a new position (we haven\'t tried 5 before).\n\nWe could also try A in position 4.\n\nFor example: ""VOILA"" — but has V, O, I, L, A. I and L are forbidden.\n\n""GUAVA"" — has G, U, A, V, A. But A is in position 3 and 5? We know position 3 is invalid for A, so position 3 would be wrong. Also, we are testing G, U, V. But we have two A\'s.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nHowever, ""DOGMA"" seems better because it uses more common letters? G and M are medium, D and O are common.\n\nAnother word: ""ABYSM"" — not common, and has S? No, A, B, Y, S, M. S is forbidden.\n\n""JUMBO"" — no A.\n\nWe need A.\n\n""COMA"" is 4 letters.\n\n""DOGMA"" is 5 letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZEN"" — has Z, E, N. E and N are forbidden.\n\n""DOGMA"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can get a word with A in position 1 without forbidden letters.\n\n""AGLOW"" — has G, L, O, W. But L is forbidden.\n\n""AGONE"" — has G, O, N, E. N and E forbidden.\n\n""AHOLD"" — has H, O, L, D. L is forbidden.\n\nIt\'s difficult. So position 1 might not be easy.\n\nPosition 4: ""ULTRA"" — has U, L, T, R, A. L, T, R forbidden.\n\n""OMEGA"" — has M, E, G, A. E forbidden.\n\n""DELTA"" — forbidden letters.\n\nSo position 4 is also hard.\n\nTherefore, position 5 might be the easiest for now.\n\nAnother word: ""MAMBA"" — has M, A, M, B, A. A in position 2 and 5. But we know position 2 is wrong for A, so we would get a \'-\' for position 2? But we already know A is not in position 2, so it would be a waste. We want to test a new position for A.\n\nIn ""MAMBA"", A is in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are effectively only testing position 5 for A, and the other letters M and B.\n\nBut we are using two spots for A, which might not be efficient.\n\n""DOGMA"" has only one A, in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUMA"" — not a common word.\n\n""DOGMA"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""DOULA"" — has O, U, L, A. But L is forbidden.\n\n""DIARY"" — has D, I, A, R, Y. I and R forbidden.\n\n""DAISY"" — has D, A, I, S, Y. I and S forbidden.\n\nSo ""DOGMA"" seems a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""GAMMA"" — but A in position 2 and 5? We know position 2 is wrong, so same issue.\n\n""PHASE"" — has P, H, A, S, E. S and E forbidden.\n\nSo I think ""DOGMA"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll guess ""DOGMA"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: D, O, G, M, A.\n\n- D: new\n- O: new\n- G: new\n- M: new\n- A: known, in position 5 (new position)\n\nAnd we avoid all forbidden letters.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo the next guess is ""DOGMA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is in the secret word but not in position 3.  \n  - C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  \n  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - A is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1, where it was not in position 3).  \n  - T, I, L, S are not in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**:  \n   - The secret word contains the letter **A**, but it is **not in position 2 or 3**.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""dogma"":
- D: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position)
- G: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'O' is in the secret word and in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and it's correct).
2. The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the fifth position (we guessed it in position 5 and it's correct).
3. The letter 'D' is in the secret word but not in the first position (since we guessed it in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position).
4. The letters G and M are not in the secret word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word contains 'A' (now confirmed in position 5) and 'O' (in position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

Now, we have the following constraints:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: A (fixed)
- The letter 'D' is in the word but not in position 1.
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two of them: O in position 2 and A in position 5.

Also, we know the word has at least one more letter: D, which is present but not in position 1.

Moreover, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

So the available letters are: A, D, O (but we already know their presence) and other letters not eliminated. We need to find the remaining letters.

Available letters (excluding known and eliminated): 
B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but we focus on common ones.

We know the word has D, O, A. And O is in position 2, A in position 5.

The word structure: _ O _ _ A

We also know D is in the word but not in position 1. So D must be in position 3 or 4.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4. But note: D is in one of positions 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters that are not eliminated and not O or A (since we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now? But we must be cautious).

However, we have only one D, and we know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 3 or 4.

Now, for position 1: it cannot be D (because D is not in position 1), and cannot be any eliminated letter. So we need a letter from the available set.

Similarly, for position 3 and 4: one of them is D (if D is in position 3 or 4) and the other is a new letter.

But note: we don't know if there are more letters. We have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is D (in 3 or 4) and the other two are new letters.

We also know the word has exactly these five letters? We don't know, but we have to form a valid word.

So let's list possible words.

The pattern: _ O _ _ A

With D in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: D in position 3.
Then the word is: _ O D _ A

Case 2: D in position 4.
Then the word is: _ O _ D A

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters not in the eliminated set and not O, A (unless duplicates, but we have no indication of duplicates so we avoid for now).

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

Available common letters: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

We can try to think of words that fit these patterns.

First, case 1: _ O D _ A

Possible words:
- BODKA? Not a word.
- PODGY? But G is eliminated.
- FODDA? Not a word.
- HODAD? H, O, D, A, D -> but two D's? And A is already in position 5. But we have D in position 3 and then another D? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, ""HODAD"" is a word? It means a boringly conventional person. But let's check: positions: H in 1, O in 2, D in 3, A in 4, D in 5? But we have A in position 5, so if we put A in 5, then position 4 must be something else. The pattern is _ O D _ A, so position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is A.

So for _ O D _ A, we need a letter for position 1 and position 4.

Examples:
- ""JODHA"" - not common, and J might be available? But we haven't eliminated J. But let's see: J, O, D, H, A? But we don't know if H is in the word. And is ""JODHA"" a word? Not really, it's a name.
- ""FODDA"" - not a word.
- ""YODHA"" - not common.

Common words: 
- ""PODIA"" - but P, O, D, I, A. I is eliminated. Invalid.
- ""BODYA"" - not a word.

This pattern seems difficult.

Case 2: _ O _ D A

This seems more promising.

Examples:
- ""FORD A"" but we have two words? No, we need one word. ""FORDA"" is not a word.
- ""BOWDA"" - not a word.
- ""HOODA"" - not a word.
- ""VOID A"" -> ""VOIDA"" not a word.
- ""WOADA"" - not a word.

Common words:
- ""VOLTA"" - but V, O, L, T, A. L and T are eliminated. Invalid.
- ""BOOZA"" - not common.
- ""POODA"" - not a word.

But we have a common word: ""KODAK"" - but K, O, D, A, K. But we have A in position 5? ""KODAK"" is K, O, D, A, K -> positions: 1:K, 2:O, 3:D, 4:A, 5:K -> but we need position 5 to be A, so that doesn't match. Our pattern requires position 5 to be A, so ""KODAK"" has A in position 4.

We need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be A.

So the pattern is _ O _ D A.

Let me think of words ending with ""DA"" and having O in the second position.

For example:
- ""BODDA"" - not a word.
- ""GODDA"" - not a word.
- ""PODDA"" - not a word.

Another idea: ""JUDOA"" - not a word.

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but that has E and L, and doesn't end with A.

We might be missing something.

Another possibility: the word ""ABO"" something, but we have O in position 2 and A in position 5.

List of words: how about ""ABOUT"" but we have eliminated T and U is not in the pattern.

Perhaps we should consider that D might not be the only letter? We have to fill position 1, 3, and 4, but D is in one of 3 or 4, and we have two more letters.

But we know the word has D, O, A, and two more letters.

We also have the feedback that D is not in position 1, and we have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with D in 3 or 4 and two other letters.

But in the pattern _ O _ _ A, if D is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 to fill. If D is in position 4, we have position 1 and 3 to fill.

Now, let's think of common words that have O in the second position and A in the fifth.

For example:
- ""FOCAL"" - but C and L eliminated, and A is not in fifth? F O C A L -> A in fourth, not fifth.
- ""LOCAL"" - L and C eliminated.
- ""VODKA"" - V, O, D, K, A -> this fits the pattern: position 1:V, 2:O, 3:D, 4:K, 5:A. But we have D in position 3? And we are allowed V and K.

But in our feedback, for ""DOGMA"", we have D marked as present but wrong position. In ""VODKA"", D is in position 3, which is not position 1, so that matches.

Also, V and K are not eliminated.

So ""VODKA"" is a possible candidate.

But is ""VODKA"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Now, check the letters: V, O, D, K, A.

- O is in position 2 (correct as per feedback).
- A is in position 5 (correct).
- D is in position 3 (and we know D is not in position 1, so position 3 is possible).

And we avoid eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

So ""VODKA"" is a valid guess.

But we are not sure if it's the secret word, but we can guess it to check.

Another possibility: what if D is in position 4?

Then the pattern is _ O _ D A.

For example, ""BOFDA"" not a word.

""COWED"" has E and W, but E eliminated, and doesn't end with A.

""ROWED"" has R, E, eliminated.

""POWDER"" is 6 letters.

""JOWAR"" - J, O, W, A, R -> but R eliminated, and A is in position 4, not 5.

So it seems difficult to find a word with D in position 4.

Therefore, the most plausible is ""VODKA"".

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" but has E and N, eliminated.

""DOGMA"" we already guessed.

""DOULA"" has L, eliminated.

""DOUMA"" not common.

""VODKA"" seems the best candidate.

But we have to make sure that V and K are allowed. We haven't used them, and they are not eliminated.

So I think ""VODKA"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we'll guess ""VODKA"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""A"" is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""A"" is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - T, I, L, S are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""dogma""**  
  Feedback: D(-), O(✓), G(x), M(x), A(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""O"" is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - ""A"" is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.  
  - ""D"" is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - G and M are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 5: **A**  
   - **D** is present but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 3 or 4).  

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   - C, R, N, E (from Guess 1)  
   - T, I, L, S (from Guess 2)  
   - G, M (from Guess 3)  
   - Total eliminated: **C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M** (10 letters).  

3. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word follows the pattern: `_ O _ _ A`  
   - ""D"" must occupy position 3 or 4.  
   - Positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled with new letters (excluding eliminated letters and the confirmed O and A).  

4. **Available Letters**:  
   - Focus on high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
   - Given the pattern, ""D"" in position 3 or 4 is likely, with position 1 and the remaining middle slot filled by new letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize testing ""D"" in position 3 or 4** while covering new common letters.  
- **""VODKA""** fits perfectly:  
  - `V O D K A` → Tests ""D"" in position 3 (a possible location).  
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: V (position 1), K (position 4).  
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  
- If correct, this guess could solve the puzzle. If not, it will reveal critical info about ""D"" and other letters.  

<guess>vodka</guess>",vodka,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""dogma"":
- D: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position)
- G: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter 'O' is in the secret word and in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and it's correct).
2. The letter 'A' is in the secret word and in the fifth position (we guessed it in position 5 and it's correct).
3. The letter 'D' is in the secret word but not in the first position (since we guessed it in position 1 and it's marked as wrong position).
4. The letters G and M are not in the secret word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word contains 'A' (now confirmed in position 5) and 'O' (in position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

Now, we have the following constraints:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 5: A (fixed)
- The letter 'D' is in the word but not in position 1.
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two of them: O in position 2 and A in position 5.

Also, we know the word has at least one more letter: D, which is present but not in position 1.

Moreover, we have eliminated: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

So the available letters are: A, D, O (but we already know their presence) and other letters not eliminated. We need to find the remaining letters.

Available letters (excluding known and eliminated): 
B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but we focus on common ones.

We know the word has D, O, A. And O is in position 2, A in position 5.

The word structure: _ O _ _ A

We also know D is in the word but not in position 1. So D must be in position 3 or 4.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4. But note: D is in one of positions 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters that are not eliminated and not O or A (since we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now? But we must be cautious).

However, we have only one D, and we know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 3 or 4.

Now, for position 1: it cannot be D (because D is not in position 1), and cannot be any eliminated letter. So we need a letter from the available set.

Similarly, for position 3 and 4: one of them is D (if D is in position 3 or 4) and the other is a new letter.

But note: we don't know if there are more letters. We have three positions to fill (1,3,4) and we know one of them is D (in 3 or 4) and the other two are new letters.

We also know the word has exactly these five letters? We don't know, but we have to form a valid word.

So let's list possible words.

The pattern: _ O _ _ A

With D in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: D in position 3.
Then the word is: _ O D _ A

Case 2: D in position 4.
Then the word is: _ O _ D A

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters not in the eliminated set and not O, A (unless duplicates, but we have no indication of duplicates so we avoid for now).

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

Available common letters: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

We can try to think of words that fit these patterns.

First, case 1: _ O D _ A

Possible words:
- BODKA? Not a word.
- PODGY? But G is eliminated.
- FODDA? Not a word.
- HODAD? H, O, D, A, D -> but two D's? And A is already in position 5. But we have D in position 3 and then another D? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, ""HODAD"" is a word? It means a boringly conventional person. But let's check: positions: H in 1, O in 2, D in 3, A in 4, D in 5? But we have A in position 5, so if we put A in 5, then position 4 must be something else. The pattern is _ O D _ A, so position 4 is the fourth letter and position 5 is A.

So for _ O D _ A, we need a letter for position 1 and position 4.

Examples:
- ""JODHA"" - not common, and J might be available? But we haven't eliminated J. But let's see: J, O, D, H, A? But we don't know if H is in the word. And is ""JODHA"" a word? Not really, it's a name.
- ""FODDA"" - not a word.
- ""YODHA"" - not common.

Common words: 
- ""PODIA"" - but P, O, D, I, A. I is eliminated. Invalid.
- ""BODYA"" - not a word.

This pattern seems difficult.

Case 2: _ O _ D A

This seems more promising.

Examples:
- ""FORD A"" but we have two words? No, we need one word. ""FORDA"" is not a word.
- ""BOWDA"" - not a word.
- ""HOODA"" - not a word.
- ""VOID A"" -> ""VOIDA"" not a word.
- ""WOADA"" - not a word.

Common words:
- ""VOLTA"" - but V, O, L, T, A. L and T are eliminated. Invalid.
- ""BOOZA"" - not common.
- ""POODA"" - not a word.

But we have a common word: ""KODAK"" - but K, O, D, A, K. But we have A in position 5? ""KODAK"" is K, O, D, A, K -> positions: 1:K, 2:O, 3:D, 4:A, 5:K -> but we need position 5 to be A, so that doesn't match. Our pattern requires position 5 to be A, so ""KODAK"" has A in position 4.

We need position 4 to be D and position 5 to be A.

So the pattern is _ O _ D A.

Let me think of words ending with ""DA"" and having O in the second position.

For example:
- ""BODDA"" - not a word.
- ""GODDA"" - not a word.
- ""PODDA"" - not a word.

Another idea: ""JUDOA"" - not a word.

Perhaps ""YODEL"" but that has E and L, and doesn't end with A.

We might be missing something.

Another possibility: the word ""ABO"" something, but we have O in position 2 and A in position 5.

List of words: how about ""ABOUT"" but we have eliminated T and U is not in the pattern.

Perhaps we should consider that D might not be the only letter? We have to fill position 1, 3, and 4, but D is in one of 3 or 4, and we have two more letters.

But we know the word has D, O, A, and two more letters.

We also have the feedback that D is not in position 1, and we have positions 1, 3, 4 to fill with D in 3 or 4 and two other letters.

But in the pattern _ O _ _ A, if D is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 to fill. If D is in position 4, we have position 1 and 3 to fill.

Now, let's think of common words that have O in the second position and A in the fifth.

For example:
- ""FOCAL"" - but C and L eliminated, and A is not in fifth? F O C A L -> A in fourth, not fifth.
- ""LOCAL"" - L and C eliminated.
- ""VODKA"" - V, O, D, K, A -> this fits the pattern: position 1:V, 2:O, 3:D, 4:K, 5:A. But we have D in position 3? And we are allowed V and K.

But in our feedback, for ""DOGMA"", we have D marked as present but wrong position. In ""VODKA"", D is in position 3, which is not position 1, so that matches.

Also, V and K are not eliminated.

So ""VODKA"" is a possible candidate.

But is ""VODKA"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Now, check the letters: V, O, D, K, A.

- O is in position 2 (correct as per feedback).
- A is in position 5 (correct).
- D is in position 3 (and we know D is not in position 1, so position 3 is possible).

And we avoid eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M.

So ""VODKA"" is a valid guess.

But we are not sure if it's the secret word, but we can guess it to check.

Another possibility: what if D is in position 4?

Then the pattern is _ O _ D A.

For example, ""BOFDA"" not a word.

""COWED"" has E and W, but E eliminated, and doesn't end with A.

""ROWED"" has R, E, eliminated.

""POWDER"" is 6 letters.

""JOWAR"" - J, O, W, A, R -> but R eliminated, and A is in position 4, not 5.

So it seems difficult to find a word with D in position 4.

Therefore, the most plausible is ""VODKA"".

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" but has E and N, eliminated.

""DOGMA"" we already guessed.

""DOULA"" has L, eliminated.

""DOUMA"" not common.

""VODKA"" seems the best candidate.

But we have to make sure that V and K are allowed. We haven't used them, and they are not eliminated.

So I think ""VODKA"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we'll guess ""VODKA"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""A"" is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are absent from the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""tails""**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), I(x), L(x), S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""A"" is still in the secret word but not in position 2 (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - T, I, L, S are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""dogma""**  
  Feedback: D(-), O(✓), G(x), M(x), A(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - ""O"" is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 2.  
  - ""A"" is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 5.  
  - ""D"" is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - G and M are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
   - Position 2: **O**  
   - Position 5: **A**  
   - **D** is present but not in position 1 (so it must be in position 3 or 4).  

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   - C, R, N, E (from Guess 1)  
   - T, I, L, S (from Guess 2)  
   - G, M (from Guess 3)  
   - Total eliminated: **C, R, N, E, T, I, L, S, G, M** (10 letters).  

3. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word follows the pattern: `_ O _ _ A`  
   - ""D"" must occupy position 3 or 4.  
   - Positions 1, 3, and 4 need to be filled with new letters (excluding eliminated letters and the confirmed O and A).  

4. **Available Letters**:  
   - Focus on high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
   - Given the pattern, ""D"" in position 3 or 4 is likely, with position 1 and the remaining middle slot filled by new letters.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Prioritize testing ""D"" in position 3 or 4** while covering new common letters.  
- **""VODKA""** fits perfectly:  
  - `V O D K A` → Tests ""D"" in position 3 (a possible location).  
  - Uses new high-frequency letters: V (position 1), K (position 4).  
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  
- If correct, this guess could solve the puzzle. If not, it will reveal critical info about ""D"" and other letters.",Guess 4: vodka -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) O(✓) D(✓) K(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
