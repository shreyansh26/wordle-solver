First, the previous feedback was for my guess ""crane"". The feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it's the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, in the secret word:
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.

Also, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

Now, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Not contain C, R, or N.

Since A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.

I need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.

Possible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.

Common vowels: A and E are already placed, but there might be more vowels. A and E are used, but I might include I, O, U.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.

I should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.

Letters I haven't tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.

In position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.

So words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.

Now, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.

Possible words: Let me brainstorm.

- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Plate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.

But I don't know if L, P, T are in the word or not.

Instead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.

For example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.

""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.

Common words:

- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.

Whale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.

But I have no information about H or L yet.

Similarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

Share has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.

Similarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.

So back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E

S, H, D are new letters.

""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E

P, L, T, new.

""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.

""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.

""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.

""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.

I need to choose one that maximizes new information.

Since positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.

For example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.

Perhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.

""State"" S-T-A-T-E → positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

But T is repeated; it might be fine, but if T is not in word, it will show x, but since it's repeated, feedback might be tricky if T appears once only.

Wordle handles repeated letters, but for efficiency, better to avoid duplicates if possible, to test more distinct letters.

In this case, for ""state"", letters are S, T, A, E — A and E known, S and T to test.

But positions matter.

Better to have all different letters where possible.

""Whale"": W, H, A, L, E — letters: W,H,A,L,E — A and E known, W,H,L new.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D new.

""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.

Perhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.

""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.

But ""slate"" has L and T.

Another option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3! Saute is S-A-U-T-E, so position 3 is U, so wrong pattern.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

""Spade"": S-P-A-D-E — S,P,D,E — E is position 5, A position 3.

Yes.

""Blade"": B-L-A-D-E — B,L,D.

I think ""plate"" or ""shade"" could be fine.

Let me choose ""plate"" for now.

In ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E

If I guess, and get feedback, I can learn about P, L, T.

In position 1: P

Position 2: L

Position 4: T

And A and E are fixed correct.

But feedback might show if P, L, T are in word or not, and if in position or wrong position.

Another word: ""beige"" — B-E-I-G-E — but A? No, third is I, not A.

Must have A in position 3.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E — U in pos 2? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) — yes, but Q is rare, and U, K.

Not ideal.

So better to stick with common letters.

""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden! R not in word.

Can't use.

""Bake"": B-A-K-E — only 4 letters? Must be 5-letter, so no.

""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.

Also possible.

Among ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.

Perhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.

For example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.

""A "" in position 3.

""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Valid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.

Plane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.

Similarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.

So must avoid C,R,N.

Back to ""_ _ A _ E""

Let me list some options:

- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.

- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.

- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.

- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.

Flake is a word.

- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.

- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.

Stake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.

Spake not common, I think spake is archaic.

Glaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.

Blare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.

So ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.

S, H, K.

Perhaps ""shake"" is good.

""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.

P, L, T.

Letters L and T are common.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.

D is less common than L or T? D is fine.

Another word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.

""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.

No.

""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.

Must be third letter A.

So words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.

Perhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.

For example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.

Image: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.

I is a vowel, good to test.

Similarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.

Opaque is a word.

But less common.

""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.

""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.

Not.

So ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".

""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.

"" Plate"" has common consonants.

Since A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there's another vowel.

Previous guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.

Crane had vowels A,E.

C,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.

Now, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.

It might have no other vowels, or have I or O.

By using ""image"", I can test for I.

Similarly, ""oxide"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.

If A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.

But it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.

For example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.

But since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn't help much to have duplicate A.

Similarly, E is at end.

So better to avoid duplicates if possible.

"" Image"" no duplicates.

""Plate"" no duplicates.

I think I'll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.

""Image"": I-M-A-G-E

Positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E

With A and E fixed correct.

So feedback will tell about I, M, G.

If I is in the word, if M, etc.

Also, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.

But ""image"" is fine.

To maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""beige"" not A.

I think ""image"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.

Not matching.

So I'll guess ""image"".

But let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.

Since A and E are correct, they should show ✓.

In the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>

But first, I need to think step by step.

So thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).
- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.

For my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).

Considering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:
- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.
- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.
- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.

This guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.

<guess>image</guess>",image,"First, the previous feedback was for my guess ""crane"". The feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it's the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, in the secret word:
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.

Also, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

Now, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Not contain C, R, or N.

Since A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.

I need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.

Possible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.

I should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.

Letters I haven't tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.

In position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.

So words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.

Now, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.

Possible words: Let me brainstorm.

- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Plate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.

But I don't know if L, P, T are in the word or not.

Instead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.

For example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.

""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.

Common words:

- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.

Whale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.

But I have no information about H or L yet.

Similarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

Share has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.

Similarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.

So back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E

S, H, D are new letters.

""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E

P, L, T, new.

""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.

""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.

""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.

""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.

I need to choose one that maximizes new information.

Since positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.

For example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.

Perhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.

""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.

Perhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.

""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.

But ""slate"" has L and T.

Another option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3! Saute is S-A-U-T-E, so position 3 is U, so wrong pattern.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

""Spade"": S-P-A-D-E — S,P,D,E — E is position 5, A position 3.

Yes.

""Blade"": B-L-A-D-E — B,L,D.

I think ""plate"" or ""shade"" could be fine.

Let me choose ""plate"" for now.

In ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E

In position 1: P

Not ideal.

So better to stick with common letters.

""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden! R not in word.

Can't use.

""Bake"": B-A-K-E — only 4 letters? Must be 5-letter, so no.

""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.

Also possible.

Among ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.

Perhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.

For example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.

""A "" in position 3.

""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Valid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.

Plane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.

Similarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.

So must avoid C,R,N.

Back to ""_ _ A _ E""

Let me list some options:

- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.

- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.

- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.

- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.

Flake is a word.

- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.

- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.

Stake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.

Spake not common, I think spake is archaic.

Glaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.

Blare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.

So ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.

S, H, K.

Perhaps ""shake"" is good.

""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.

P, L, T.

Letters L and T are common.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.

D is less common than L or T? D is fine.

Another word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.

""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.

No.

""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.

Must be third letter A.

So words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.

Perhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.

For example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.

Image: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.

I is a vowel, good to test.

Similarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.

Opaque is a word.

But less common.

""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.

""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.

Not.

So ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".

""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.

"" Plate"" has common consonants.

Since A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there's another vowel.

Previous guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.

Crane had vowels A,E.

C,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.

Now, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.

It might have no other vowels, or have I or O.

By using ""image"", I can test for I.

Similarly, ""oxide"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.

If A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.

But it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.

For example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.

But since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn't help much to have duplicate A.

Similarly, E is at end.

So better to avoid duplicates if possible.

"" Image"" no duplicates.

""Plate"" no duplicates.

I think I'll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.

""Image"": I-M-A-G-E

Positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E

With A and E fixed correct.

So feedback will tell about I, M, G.

If I is in the word, if M, etc.

Also, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.

But ""image"" is fine.

To maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""beige"" not A.

I think ""image"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.

Not matching.

So I'll guess ""image"".

But let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.

Since A and E are correct, they should show ✓.

In the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>

But first, I need to think step by step.

So thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).
- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.

For my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).

Considering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:
- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.
- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.
- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.

This guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.",Guess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SKATE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous feedback was for my guess ""crane"". The feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it's the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, in the secret word:
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.

Also, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

Now, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Not contain C, R, or N.

Since A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.

I need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.

Possible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.

Common vowels: A and E are already placed, but there might be more vowels. A and E are used, but I might include I, O, U.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.

I should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.

Letters I haven't tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.

In position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.

So words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.

Now, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.

Possible words: Let me brainstorm.

- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Plate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.

But I don't know if L, P, T are in the word or not.

Instead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.

For example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.

""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.

Common words:

- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.

Whale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.

But I have no information about H or L yet.

Similarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

Share has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.

Similarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.

So back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E

S, H, D are new letters.

""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E

P, L, T, new.

""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.

""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.

""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.

""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.

I need to choose one that maximizes new information.

Since positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.

For example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.

Perhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.

""State"" S-T-A-T-E → positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

But T is repeated; it might be fine, but if T is not in word, it will show x, but since it's repeated, feedback might be tricky if T appears once only.

Wordle handles repeated letters, but for efficiency, better to avoid duplicates if possible, to test more distinct letters.

In this case, for ""state"", letters are S, T, A, E — A and E known, S and T to test.

But positions matter.

Better to have all different letters where possible.

""Whale"": W, H, A, L, E — letters: W,H,A,L,E — A and E known, W,H,L new.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D new.

""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.

Perhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.

""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.

But ""slate"" has L and T.

Another option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3! Saute is S-A-U-T-E, so position 3 is U, so wrong pattern.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

""Spade"": S-P-A-D-E — S,P,D,E — E is position 5, A position 3.

Yes.

""Blade"": B-L-A-D-E — B,L,D.

I think ""plate"" or ""shade"" could be fine.

Let me choose ""plate"" for now.

In ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E

If I guess, and get feedback, I can learn about P, L, T.

In position 1: P

Position 2: L

Position 4: T

And A and E are fixed correct.

But feedback might show if P, L, T are in word or not, and if in position or wrong position.

Another word: ""beige"" — B-E-I-G-E — but A? No, third is I, not A.

Must have A in position 3.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E — U in pos 2? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) — yes, but Q is rare, and U, K.

Not ideal.

So better to stick with common letters.

""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden! R not in word.

Can't use.

""Bake"": B-A-K-E — only 4 letters? Must be 5-letter, so no.

""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.

Also possible.

Among ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.

Perhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.

For example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.

""A "" in position 3.

""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Valid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.

Plane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.

Similarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.

So must avoid C,R,N.

Back to ""_ _ A _ E""

Let me list some options:

- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.

- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.

- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.

- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.

Flake is a word.

- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.

- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.

Stake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.

Spake not common, I think spake is archaic.

Glaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.

Blare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.

So ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.

S, H, K.

Perhaps ""shake"" is good.

""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.

P, L, T.

Letters L and T are common.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.

D is less common than L or T? D is fine.

Another word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.

""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.

No.

""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.

Must be third letter A.

So words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.

Perhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.

For example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.

Image: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.

I is a vowel, good to test.

Similarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.

Opaque is a word.

But less common.

""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.

""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.

Not.

So ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".

""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.

"" Plate"" has common consonants.

Since A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there's another vowel.

Previous guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.

Crane had vowels A,E.

C,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.

Now, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.

It might have no other vowels, or have I or O.

By using ""image"", I can test for I.

Similarly, ""oxide"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.

If A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.

But it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.

For example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.

But since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn't help much to have duplicate A.

Similarly, E is at end.

So better to avoid duplicates if possible.

"" Image"" no duplicates.

""Plate"" no duplicates.

I think I'll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.

""Image"": I-M-A-G-E

Positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E

With A and E fixed correct.

So feedback will tell about I, M, G.

If I is in the word, if M, etc.

Also, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.

But ""image"" is fine.

To maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""beige"" not A.

I think ""image"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.

Not matching.

So I'll guess ""image"".

But let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.

Since A and E are correct, they should show ✓.

In the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>

But first, I need to think step by step.

So thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).
- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.

For my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).

Considering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:
- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.
- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.
- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.

This guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.

Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).\n- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.\n\nFor my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).\n\nConsidering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:\n- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.\n- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.\n- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nThis guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.\n\n<guess>image</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": 
  - C: not in the word (x)
  - R: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3
  - N: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5

- From ""image"":
  - I: not in the word (x)
  - M: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (as expected)
  - G: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5 (as expected)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G
- Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, N, I, M, G.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to make a new guess that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the available letters (avoiding C, R, N, I, M, G).

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters:

- We need words with 5 letters: first, second, and fourth positions to fill, with A at 3 and E at 5.

Common words:
- ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E -> but we have P, L, T. However, we haven't tested P, L, T yet. But in ""plate"", position 1 is P, 2 is L, 4 is T.
- ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E -> S, H, D
- ""stake"": S-T-A-K-E -> S, T, K
- ""blade"": B-L-A-D-E -> B, L, D
- ""flame"": F-L-A-M-E -> but M is excluded (from ""image"" feedback, M is not in the word), so invalid.
- ""shake"": S-H-A-K-E -> S, H, K
- ""spade"": S-P-A-D-E -> S, P, D
- ""glade"": G-L-A-D-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.
- ""beige"": doesn't fit pattern (A not at 3)
- ""alive"": A at position 1, not 3.

Since M and G are out, we avoid them.

Also, from ""crane"", we know C, R, N are out.

So, let's list possible words without C, R, N, I, M, G:

- ""plate"": uses P, L, T
- ""shade"": uses S, H, D
- ""stake"": uses S, T, K
- ""shake"": uses S, H, K
- ""spade"": uses S, P, D
- ""blade"": uses B, L, D
- ""flame"": invalid because M is out
- ""whale"": W-H-A-L-E -> W, H, L
- ""scale"": invalid, C is out
- ""brake"": invalid, R is out

We also have ""paste"": P-A-S-T-E -> but A is at position 2, not 3. We need A at position 3.

""Paste"" is P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> not, because position 3 is S, not A.

We need position 3 to be A.

So, ""plate"" is good: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Similarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S, L, T.

""Slate"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: S, L, T are not excluded yet.

Excluded: C, R, N, I, M, G. So S, L, T are allowed.

Now, to choose a word that tests new letters effectively.

We have many options: we can test S, T, L, P, D, H, K, W, B, etc.

Since we have two positions to figure out (1,2,4) but position 4 is also unknown, we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

In the pattern _ _ A _ E, we have three positions: 1,2,4.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids repeating known information.

For example, ""plate"" tests P, L, T.

""Shade"" tests S, H, D.

""Stake"" tests S, T, K.

""Whale"" tests W, H, L.

I think ""plate"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: P, L, T.

Alternatively, ""shade"" with S, H, D is also good.

But let's see if we can include a vowel. We know A and E are in, and I is out. So we might have O or U.

For example, ""soave"": S-O-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), O(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) -> but is ""soave"" a common word? It might be accepted, meaning a musical term or something, but perhaps not ideal.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E -> Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q and U are less common, and K is also not the most common.

""Blaze"": B-L-A-Z-E -> Z is less common.

So, sticking with more common words.

Another word: ""stage"": S-T-A-G-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.

""Space"": has C, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""plate"" is a solid choice.

But let's consider: if I use ""plate"", and if the secret word is, say, ""shade"", then I might not get much overlap.

But we need to test.

Perhaps ""stake"" to test S, T, K.

But K is less common than L or D.

""Shade"" has S, H, D.

H and D are both common.

I think I'll go with ""shade"" to test S, H, D.

""Shade"": S-H-A-D-E

Positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-D, 5-E

If I guess this, feedback will tell me about S, H, D.

If S is in the word and correct position, or not, etc.

Similarly.

But we know A and E are correct, so they will be ✓.

So, I think it's fine.

To maximize vowel testing: we have A and E, I is out, so we might test O or U.

But in position 1 or 2 or 4.

For example, ""abode"" has A at position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Ozone"" not A.

""Alone"" has A at 1.

Not.

""Adobe"" A at 1.

Not.

So, it's hard to include O or U in this pattern without rare words.

""Quake"" is one, but Q and U.

I think for now, ""shade"" or ""plate"" is better.

I'll choose ""shade"".

But let's see the response format.

Another idea: since we have few letters left, we can think of possible words.

Possible secret words: must be _ _ A _ E, no C,R,N,I,M,G.

For example:
- ""shade"": S H A D E
- ""plate"": P L A T E
- ""stake"": S T A K E
- ""blade"": B L A D E
- ""whale"": W H A L E
- ""spade"": S P A D E
- ""shake"": S H A K E
- ""slate"": S L A T E
- ""brake"": has R, invalid
- ""flake"": F L A K E
- ""snake"": has N, invalid
- ""space"": has C, invalid

Also, ""beige"" not pattern.

So, by guessing ""shade"", if it's not correct, we can eliminate S, H, D or get clues.

Similarly for others.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess.

But in ""shade"", we have S, H, D to test.

If I guess ""plate"", I test P, L, T.

Both are fine.

Perhaps I can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities.

For example, in the list above, S appears in ""shade"", ""stake"", ""shake"", ""spade"", ""slate"".

L appears in ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"", ""slate"".

T appears in ""plate"", ""stake"", ""slate"".

So S and L are very common in the possibilities.

Therefore, guessing a word with S and L might be efficient.

For example, ""slate"": S-L-A-T-E

""Slate"" has S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

And it tests S, L, T.

If S is in the word, and if L is, etc.

Moreover, ""slate"" is a common starting word.

But we have constraints.

In this case, ""slate"" uses S, L, T, all new.

And it fits the pattern.

Also, it avoids excluded letters.

So, I think ""slate"" is a good choice.

Compared to ""shade"", which has S, H, D.

H and D might be less frequent than L and T? Not necessarily.

But ""slate"" covers more of the common possibilities.

For example, if S is not in the word, then many options like ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"" are still possible, but ""shade"", ""stake"", etc. would be eliminated.

Similarly, if L is not, then ""shade"", ""stake"", ""spade"" might be possible.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I'll go with ""slate"".

So, guess: ""slate""

<guess>slate</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, while C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From ""image"": I, M, and G are not in the word, confirming A and E are still correctly placed.

The secret word must follow the pattern _ _ A _ E and cannot contain C, R, N, I, M, or G. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I chose ""slate"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).
- It tests new common letters: S, L, and T, which appear frequently in potential solutions (e.g., ""plate"", ""blade"", ""stake"", ""shake"").
- It avoids duplicate letters and excluded letters, maximizing information gain about the remaining possibilities.

<guess>slate</guess>",slate,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- ""shake"": uses S, H, K

- ""scale"": invalid, C is out
- ""brake"": invalid, R is out

We also have ""paste"": P-A-S-T-E -> but A is at position 2, not 3. We need A at position 3.

""Paste"" is P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> not, because position 3 is S, not A.

We need position 3 to be A.

So, ""plate"" is good: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

""Slate"" is a common word.

If I guess this, feedback will tell me about S, H, D.

If S is in the word and correct position, or not, etc.

Similarly.

But we know A and E are correct, so they will be ✓.

So, I think it's fine.

To maximize vowel testing: we have A and E, I is out, so we might test O or U.

But in position 1 or 2 or 4.

For example, ""abode"" has A at position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Ozone"" not A.

""Alone"" has A at 1.

Not.

""Adobe"" A at 1.

Not.

So, it's hard to include O or U in this pattern without rare words.

""Quake"" is one, but Q and U.

I think for now, ""shade"" or ""plate"" is better.

I'll choose ""shade"".

But let's see the response format.

Another idea: since we have few letters left, we can think of possible words.

Possible secret words: must be _ _ A _ E, no C,R,N,I,M,G.

For example:
- ""shade"": S H A D E
- ""plate"": P L A T E
- ""stake"": S T A K E
- ""blade"": B L A D E
- ""whale"": W H A L E
- ""spade"": S P A D E
- ""shake"": S H A K E
- ""slate"": S L A T E
- ""brake"": has R, invalid
- ""flake"": F L A K E
- ""snake"": has N, invalid
- ""space"": has C, invalid

Also, ""beige"" not pattern.

So, by guessing ""shade"", if it's not correct, we can eliminate S, H, D or get clues.

Similarly for others.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess.

But in ""shade"", we have S, H, D to test.

If I guess ""plate"", I test P, L, T.

Both are fine.

Perhaps I can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities.

For example, in the list above, S appears in ""shade"", ""stake"", ""shake"", ""spade"", ""slate"".

L appears in ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"", ""slate"".

T appears in ""plate"", ""stake"", ""slate"".

So S and L are very common in the possibilities.

Therefore, guessing a word with S and L might be efficient.

For example, ""slate"": S-L-A-T-E

""Slate"" has S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

And it tests S, L, T.

If S is in the word, and if L is, etc.

Moreover, ""slate"" is a common starting word.

But we have constraints.

In this case, ""slate"" uses S, L, T, all new.

And it fits the pattern.

Also, it avoids excluded letters.

So, I think ""slate"" is a good choice.

Compared to ""shade"", which has S, H, D.

H and D might be less frequent than L and T? Not necessarily.

But ""slate"" covers more of the common possibilities.

For example, if S is not in the word, then many options like ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"" are still possible, but ""shade"", ""stake"", etc. would be eliminated.

Similarly, if L is not, then ""shade"", ""stake"", ""spade"" might be possible.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I'll go with ""slate"".

So, guess: ""slate""

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, while C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From ""image"": I, M, and G are not in the word, confirming A and E are still correctly placed.

The secret word must follow the pattern _ _ A _ E and cannot contain C, R, N, I, M, or G. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I chose ""slate"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).
- It tests new common letters: S, L, and T, which appear frequently in potential solutions (e.g., ""plate"", ""blade"", ""stake"", ""shake"").
- It avoids duplicate letters and excluded letters, maximizing information gain about the remaining possibilities.",Guess 3: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SKATE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous feedback was for my guess ""crane"". The feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it's the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, in the secret word:
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.

Also, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

Now, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Not contain C, R, or N.

Since A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.

I need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.

Possible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.

Common vowels: A and E are already placed, but there might be more vowels. A and E are used, but I might include I, O, U.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.

I should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.

Letters I haven't tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.

In position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.

So words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.

Now, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.

Possible words: Let me brainstorm.

- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Plate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.

But I don't know if L, P, T are in the word or not.

Instead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.

For example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.

""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.

Common words:

- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.

Whale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.

But I have no information about H or L yet.

Similarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

Share has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.

Similarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.

So back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E

S, H, D are new letters.

""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E

P, L, T, new.

""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.

""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.

""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.

""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.

I need to choose one that maximizes new information.

Since positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.

For example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.

Perhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.

""State"" S-T-A-T-E → positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

But T is repeated; it might be fine, but if T is not in word, it will show x, but since it's repeated, feedback might be tricky if T appears once only.

Wordle handles repeated letters, but for efficiency, better to avoid duplicates if possible, to test more distinct letters.

In this case, for ""state"", letters are S, T, A, E — A and E known, S and T to test.

But positions matter.

Better to have all different letters where possible.

""Whale"": W, H, A, L, E — letters: W,H,A,L,E — A and E known, W,H,L new.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D new.

""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.

Perhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.

""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.

But ""slate"" has L and T.

Another option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3! Saute is S-A-U-T-E, so position 3 is U, so wrong pattern.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

""Spade"": S-P-A-D-E — S,P,D,E — E is position 5, A position 3.

Yes.

""Blade"": B-L-A-D-E — B,L,D.

I think ""plate"" or ""shade"" could be fine.

Let me choose ""plate"" for now.

In ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E

If I guess, and get feedback, I can learn about P, L, T.

In position 1: P

Position 2: L

Position 4: T

And A and E are fixed correct.

But feedback might show if P, L, T are in word or not, and if in position or wrong position.

Another word: ""beige"" — B-E-I-G-E — but A? No, third is I, not A.

Must have A in position 3.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E — U in pos 2? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) — yes, but Q is rare, and U, K.

Not ideal.

So better to stick with common letters.

""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden! R not in word.

Can't use.

""Bake"": B-A-K-E — only 4 letters? Must be 5-letter, so no.

""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.

Also possible.

Among ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.

Perhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.

For example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.

""A "" in position 3.

""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Valid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.

Plane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.

Similarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.

So must avoid C,R,N.

Back to ""_ _ A _ E""

Let me list some options:

- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.

- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.

- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.

- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.

Flake is a word.

- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.

- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.

Stake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.

Spake not common, I think spake is archaic.

Glaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.

Blare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.

So ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.

S, H, K.

Perhaps ""shake"" is good.

""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.

P, L, T.

Letters L and T are common.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.

D is less common than L or T? D is fine.

Another word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.

""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.

No.

""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.

Must be third letter A.

So words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.

Perhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.

For example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.

Image: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.

I is a vowel, good to test.

Similarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.

Opaque is a word.

But less common.

""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.

""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.

Not.

So ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".

""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.

"" Plate"" has common consonants.

Since A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there's another vowel.

Previous guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.

Crane had vowels A,E.

C,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.

Now, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.

It might have no other vowels, or have I or O.

By using ""image"", I can test for I.

Similarly, ""oxide"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.

If A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.

But it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.

For example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.

But since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn't help much to have duplicate A.

Similarly, E is at end.

So better to avoid duplicates if possible.

"" Image"" no duplicates.

""Plate"" no duplicates.

I think I'll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.

""Image"": I-M-A-G-E

Positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E

With A and E fixed correct.

So feedback will tell about I, M, G.

If I is in the word, if M, etc.

Also, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.

But ""image"" is fine.

To maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""beige"" not A.

I think ""image"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.

Not matching.

So I'll guess ""image"".

But let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.

Since A and E are correct, they should show ✓.

In the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>

But first, I need to think step by step.

So thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).
- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.

For my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).

Considering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:
- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.
- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.
- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.

This guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.

<guess>image</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": 
  - C: not in the word (x)
  - R: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3
  - N: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5

- From ""image"":
  - I: not in the word (x)
  - M: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (as expected)
  - G: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5 (as expected)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G
- Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, N, I, M, G.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to make a new guess that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the available letters (avoiding C, R, N, I, M, G).

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters:

- We need words with 5 letters: first, second, and fourth positions to fill, with A at 3 and E at 5.

Common words:
- ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E -> but we have P, L, T. However, we haven't tested P, L, T yet. But in ""plate"", position 1 is P, 2 is L, 4 is T.
- ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E -> S, H, D
- ""stake"": S-T-A-K-E -> S, T, K
- ""blade"": B-L-A-D-E -> B, L, D
- ""flame"": F-L-A-M-E -> but M is excluded (from ""image"" feedback, M is not in the word), so invalid.
- ""shake"": S-H-A-K-E -> S, H, K
- ""spade"": S-P-A-D-E -> S, P, D
- ""glade"": G-L-A-D-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.
- ""beige"": doesn't fit pattern (A not at 3)
- ""alive"": A at position 1, not 3.

Since M and G are out, we avoid them.

Also, from ""crane"", we know C, R, N are out.

So, let's list possible words without C, R, N, I, M, G:

- ""plate"": uses P, L, T
- ""shade"": uses S, H, D
- ""stake"": uses S, T, K
- ""shake"": uses S, H, K
- ""spade"": uses S, P, D
- ""blade"": uses B, L, D
- ""flame"": invalid because M is out
- ""whale"": W-H-A-L-E -> W, H, L
- ""scale"": invalid, C is out
- ""brake"": invalid, R is out

We also have ""paste"": P-A-S-T-E -> but A is at position 2, not 3. We need A at position 3.

""Paste"" is P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> not, because position 3 is S, not A.

We need position 3 to be A.

So, ""plate"" is good: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Similarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S, L, T.

""Slate"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: S, L, T are not excluded yet.

Excluded: C, R, N, I, M, G. So S, L, T are allowed.

Now, to choose a word that tests new letters effectively.

We have many options: we can test S, T, L, P, D, H, K, W, B, etc.

Since we have two positions to figure out (1,2,4) but position 4 is also unknown, we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

In the pattern _ _ A _ E, we have three positions: 1,2,4.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids repeating known information.

For example, ""plate"" tests P, L, T.

""Shade"" tests S, H, D.

""Stake"" tests S, T, K.

""Whale"" tests W, H, L.

I think ""plate"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: P, L, T.

Alternatively, ""shade"" with S, H, D is also good.

But let's see if we can include a vowel. We know A and E are in, and I is out. So we might have O or U.

For example, ""soave"": S-O-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), O(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) -> but is ""soave"" a common word? It might be accepted, meaning a musical term or something, but perhaps not ideal.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E -> Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q and U are less common, and K is also not the most common.

""Blaze"": B-L-A-Z-E -> Z is less common.

So, sticking with more common words.

Another word: ""stage"": S-T-A-G-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.

""Space"": has C, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""plate"" is a solid choice.

But let's consider: if I use ""plate"", and if the secret word is, say, ""shade"", then I might not get much overlap.

But we need to test.

Perhaps ""stake"" to test S, T, K.

But K is less common than L or D.

""Shade"" has S, H, D.

H and D are both common.

I think I'll go with ""shade"" to test S, H, D.

""Shade"": S-H-A-D-E

Positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-D, 5-E

If I guess this, feedback will tell me about S, H, D.

If S is in the word and correct position, or not, etc.

Similarly.

But we know A and E are correct, so they will be ✓.

So, I think it's fine.

To maximize vowel testing: we have A and E, I is out, so we might test O or U.

But in position 1 or 2 or 4.

For example, ""abode"" has A at position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Ozone"" not A.

""Alone"" has A at 1.

Not.

""Adobe"" A at 1.

Not.

So, it's hard to include O or U in this pattern without rare words.

""Quake"" is one, but Q and U.

I think for now, ""shade"" or ""plate"" is better.

I'll choose ""shade"".

But let's see the response format.

Another idea: since we have few letters left, we can think of possible words.

Possible secret words: must be _ _ A _ E, no C,R,N,I,M,G.

For example:
- ""shade"": S H A D E
- ""plate"": P L A T E
- ""stake"": S T A K E
- ""blade"": B L A D E
- ""whale"": W H A L E
- ""spade"": S P A D E
- ""shake"": S H A K E
- ""slate"": S L A T E
- ""brake"": has R, invalid
- ""flake"": F L A K E
- ""snake"": has N, invalid
- ""space"": has C, invalid

Also, ""beige"" not pattern.

So, by guessing ""shade"", if it's not correct, we can eliminate S, H, D or get clues.

Similarly for others.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess.

But in ""shade"", we have S, H, D to test.

If I guess ""plate"", I test P, L, T.

Both are fine.

Perhaps I can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities.

For example, in the list above, S appears in ""shade"", ""stake"", ""shake"", ""spade"", ""slate"".

L appears in ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"", ""slate"".

T appears in ""plate"", ""stake"", ""slate"".

So S and L are very common in the possibilities.

Therefore, guessing a word with S and L might be efficient.

For example, ""slate"": S-L-A-T-E

""Slate"" has S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

And it tests S, L, T.

If S is in the word, and if L is, etc.

Moreover, ""slate"" is a common starting word.

But we have constraints.

In this case, ""slate"" uses S, L, T, all new.

And it fits the pattern.

Also, it avoids excluded letters.

So, I think ""slate"" is a good choice.

Compared to ""shade"", which has S, H, D.

H and D might be less frequent than L and T? Not necessarily.

But ""slate"" covers more of the common possibilities.

For example, if S is not in the word, then many options like ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"" are still possible, but ""shade"", ""stake"", etc. would be eliminated.

Similarly, if L is not, then ""shade"", ""stake"", ""spade"" might be possible.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I'll go with ""slate"".

So, guess: ""slate""

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, while C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From ""image"": I, M, and G are not in the word, confirming A and E are still correctly placed.

The secret word must follow the pattern _ _ A _ E and cannot contain C, R, N, I, M, or G. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I chose ""slate"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).
- It tests new common letters: S, L, and T, which appear frequently in potential solutions (e.g., ""plate"", ""blade"", ""stake"", ""shake"").
- It avoids duplicate letters and excluded letters, maximizing information gain about the remaining possibilities.

The feedback is:\n\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)\n\nSo, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it\'s the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.\n\nTherefore, in the secret word:\n- The third letter is A.\n- The fifth letter is E.\n\nAlso, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.\n\nNow, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:\n- Be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.\n- Not contain C, R, or N.\n\nSince A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.\n\nI need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.\n\nPossible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nCommon vowels: A and E are already placed, but there might be more vowels. A and E are used, but I might include I, O, U.\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.\n\nI should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.\n\nLetters I haven\'t tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.\n\nIn position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.\n\nSo words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.\n\nNow, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.\n\nPossible words: Let me brainstorm.\n\n- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)\n\nPlate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.\n\nBut I don\'t know if L, P, T are in the word or not.\n\nInstead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.\n\nFor example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.\n\n""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.\n\nWhale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.\n\nBut I have no information about H or L yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)\n\n""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can\'t use R.\n\nShare has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.\n\nSo back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E\n\nS, H, D are new letters.\n\n""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E\n\nP, L, T, new.\n\n""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.\n\n""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.\n\n""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.\n\n""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.\n\nI need to choose one that maximizes new information.\n\nSince positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.\n\nFor example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.\n\nPerhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.\n\n""State"" S-T-A-T-E → positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)\n\nBut T is repeated; it might be fine, but if T is not in word, it will show x, but since it\'s repeated, feedback might be tricky if T appears once only.\n\nWordle handles repeated letters, but for efficiency, better to avoid duplicates if possible, to test more distinct letters.\n\nIn this case, for ""state"", letters are S, T, A, E — A and E known, S and T to test.\n\nBut positions matter.\n\nBetter to have all different letters where possible.\n\n""Whale"": W, H, A, L, E — letters: W,H,A,L,E — A and E known, W,H,L new.\n\n""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D new.\n\n""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.\n\nPerhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.\n\n""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.\n\nBut ""slate"" has L and T.\n\nAnother option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3!

No, third is I, not A.\n\nMust have A in position 3.\n\n""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E — U in pos 2? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) — yes, but Q is rare, and U, K.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nSo better to stick with common letters.\n\n""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden!

Must be 5-letter, so no.\n\n""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nAmong ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.\n\nPerhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.\n\nFor example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.\n\n""A "" in position 3.\n\n""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nValid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.\n\nPlane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.\n\nSo must avoid C,R,N.\n\nBack to ""_ _ A _ E""\n\nLet me list some options:\n\n- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.\n\n- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.\n\n- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.\n\n- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.\n\nFlake is a word.\n\n- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.\n\n- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.\n\nStake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.\n\nSpake not common, I think spake is archaic.\n\nGlaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.\n\nBlare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.\n\nSo ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.\n\nS, H, K.\n\nPerhaps ""shake"" is good.\n\n""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.\n\nP, L, T.\n\nLetters L and T are common.\n\n""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.\n\nD is less common than L or T? D is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.\n\n""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.\n\nMust be third letter A.\n\nSo words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.\n\nPerhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.\n\nFor example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nSay, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.\n\nImage: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.\n\nI is a vowel, good to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.\n\nOpaque is a word.\n\nBut less common.\n\n""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.\n\n""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".\n\n""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.\n\n"" Plate"" has common consonants.\n\nSince A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there\'s another vowel.\n\nPrevious guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.\n\nCrane had vowels A,E.\n\nC,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.\n\nNow, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.\n\nIt might have no other vowels, or have I or O.\n\nBy using ""image"", I can test for I.\n\nSimilarly, ""oxide"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.\n\nIf A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.\n\nBut it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.\n\nFor example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.\n\nBut since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn\'t help much to have duplicate A.\n\nSimilarly, E is at end.\n\nSo better to avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n"" Image"" no duplicates.\n\n""Plate"" no duplicates.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.\n\n""Image"": I-M-A-G-E\n\nPositions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E\n\nWith A and E fixed correct.\n\nSo feedback will tell about I, M, G.\n\nIf I is in the word, if M, etc.\n\nAlso, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.\n\nBut ""image"" is fine.\n\nTo maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""beige"" not A.\n\nI think ""image"" is a valid choice.\n\nPerhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.\n\nNot.\n\n""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""image"".\n\nBut let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.\n\nSince A and E are correct, they should show ✓.\n\nIn the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>\n\nBut first, I need to think step by step.\n\nSo thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).\n- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.\n\nFor my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).\n\nConsidering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:\n- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.\n- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.\n- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nThis guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.\n\n<guess>image</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From ""crane"": \n  - C: not in the word (x)\n  - R: not in the word (x)\n  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3\n  - N: not in the word (x)\n  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\n- From ""image"":\n  - I: not in the word (x)\n  - M: not in the word (x)\n  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (as expected)\n  - G: not in the word (x)\n  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5 (as expected)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G\n- Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, N, I, M, G.\n\nThe remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).\n\nWe need to make a new guess that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the available letters (avoiding C, R, N, I, M, G).\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters:\n\n- We need words with 5 letters: first, second, and fourth positions to fill, with A at 3 and E at 5.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E -> but we have P, L, T.

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
  - So, A is in the word and in position 3, E is in the word and in position 5. C, R, N are not in the word.

- Guess 2: ""image"" -> I(x), M(x), A(✓), G(x), E(✓)
  - Confirms A and E in positions 3 and 5. I, M, G are not in the word.

- Guess 3: ""slate"" -> S(✓), L(x), A(✓), T(✓), E(✓)
  - S is in the word and in position 1 (since it's marked correct).
  - L is not in the word (x).
  - A is correct in position 3 (as before).
  - T is in the word and in position 4 (since marked correct).
  - E is correct in position 5.

So, from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has S in position 1, A in position 3, T in position 4, and E in position 5.
- Therefore, the word is S _ A T E, so the only unknown is the second letter.

- Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in the third position, T in the fourth, and E at the end. The second position must be a letter that is not in the excluded list and must form a valid English word.

The pattern is: S _ A T E

The second letter must be one that hasn't been excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we consider common ones).

Now, what are possible words that fit S _ A T E?

Common English words:
- State: S-T-A-T-E -> but T is at position 2? Let's check: 
  - Position 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> but we have T at position 4 already, and in ""slate"" we had T at position 4 correct, but in ""state"", position 2 is T and position 4 is T. However, in the feedback for ""slate"", L was not in the word, but T was correct at position 4. For ""state"", if we consider, but we haven't guessed it yet.

But we need to find words with pattern S _ A T E.

- ""State"" is S-T-A-T-E, which has position 2 as T. But in our pattern, position 4 is T, so if we have T at position 2, that might be possible if T is repeated? But we don't know if T can be repeated.

However, in the feedback from ""slate"", we have T at position 4 correct, but that doesn't say anything about T at other positions. But we know T is in the word at position 4, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback only tells us that T is in the word and at position 4 is correct. It doesn't prevent T from being in other positions.

But in ""slate"", we had T only at position 4, and it was marked correct, so we know T is in the word and position 4 is correct. But the word might have another T? We don't know.

However, for the pattern S _ A T E, the second position is unknown.

Possible words:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but position 4 is T, which we know is correct, and position 2 is also T. This is possible if the word has two T's.

But we need to check if T can be at position 2.

Other words:
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:K, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> this fits.
- ""Shate"" is not a word.
- ""Spute"" not a word.
- ""Slate"" we already guessed, but L is excluded and not in word.
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E -> a valid word, meaning a flood or rush.
- ""Stale"": S-T-A-L-E -> but L is excluded, and position 4 is L, but we know position 4 must be T, not L. ""Stale"" has position 4 as L, but we need T at position 4. So not.
- ""Scale"": has C and position 4 is L, not T, and C excluded.
- ""Soate"" not a word.

So, common words that fit S _ A T E:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E

Also, ""slate"" is out because L is excluded.

Now, are there others?
- ""Sware"": S-W-A-R-E -> but R is excluded, and position 4 is R? S-W-A-R-E, position 4 is R, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so no.
- ""Snate"" not a word.
- ""Svate"" not a word.

So, the main possibilities are ""state"", ""skate"", and ""spate"".

We need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish them.

But we have only one letter to determine: the second position.

We can guess any of them, but since we have multiple tries, we might guess one that tests the second letter.

But we know the pattern is fixed except for the second letter.

We can guess ""state"" directly.

But let's see the excluded letters: we have L excluded, but T is not excluded, so ""state"" is possible.

Similarly, K and P are not excluded.

In ""state"", the second letter is T. But we already know T is in the word at position 4. If we guess ""state"", and if the second letter is also T, it might be correct.

Similarly, for ""skate"", K is not excluded.

""Spate"" has P.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a letter not yet tested, but all letters except the second are fixed or known.

Since the only unknown is position 2, we can guess any word that fits the pattern and has a possible second letter.

But we have to avoid excluded letters for the second position.

Excluded: C,R,N,I,M,G,L.

So for second position, it can be: B,D,F,H,K,O,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But from common words, we have:
- T for ""state""
- K for ""skate""
- P for ""spate""

Also, ""shate"" not a word, ""swate"" not, etc.

Another word: ""suate"" not a word.

So only three common possibilities.

We can guess ""spate"" to test P.

But if we guess ""spate"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is not the second letter, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly, if we guess ""skate"", same thing.

But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess.

Since we have S,A,T,E fixed, and only second letter unknown, we can list the possible second letters that form words.

Possible: 
- With T: ""state""
- With K: ""skate""
- With P: ""spate""

Also, is there ""sbate""? Not a word.
""sd ate"" no.
""sfate"" no.
""shate"" no.
""soate"" no.
""suate"" no.
""svate"" no.
""swate"" no.
""sxate"" no.
""syate"" no.
""szate"" no.

So only T, K, P.

Now, we need to guess one.

To be efficient, we might choose one that is common, or we can use a word that includes other letters to test, but since all other positions are fixed, we cannot change them.

For example, we cannot change position 1,3,4,5 because they are known and correct.

So we must have S at 1, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

Therefore, the only flexibility is position 2.

So we must guess a word with one of the possible second letters.

We can guess ""spate"" for example.

But let's see the feedback from previous.

In guess 3, ""slate"" had S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓), so L is not in word, which is consistent.

Now, for the new guess, I'll go with ""spate"" to test P.

If P is in the word and at position 2, it will be correct. If not, we know P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly.

But to save a guess, if I guess ""state"", and if it's correct, I win in 4 guesses. If not, then it must be ""skate"" or ""spate"", but I can guess next.

But if I guess ""state"" and it's wrong, I know the second letter is not T, so it must be K or P.

Similarly.

Since we have three options, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think ""spate"" is a good choice because P hasn't been tested yet, while T has been tested (we know T is in the word at position 4, but we don't know about other positions).

In ""state"", we are testing if T is also at position 2.

Similarly, K hasn't been tested.

So, I'll guess ""spate"".

<guess>spate</guess>

But let's confirm: ""spate"" is S-P-A-T-E.

Positions: 1-S (should be correct), 2-P, 3-A (correct), 4-T (correct), 5-E (correct).

So feedback will show if P is correct or not.

If P is correct, we have the word. If not, then P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

But in the case P is not in the word at all, then it must be ""state"" or ""skate"", both of which don't have P.

Similarly, if P is in the word but wrong position, but since position 2 is the only position it could be, and if it's not correct there, it might not be in the word, or if it is, it must be at position 2, so if not correct, it's not in the word.

The feedback for position 2: if P is not in the word, it will be x. If it is in the word but wrong position, it would be -, but since the only unknown position is 2, and if P is in the word, it must be at position 2, so if it's not correct, it should be x, meaning not in the word.

Therefore, if we get P(x), then P is not in the word, so ""spate"" is invalid, and the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess ""skate"" next to test K.

Similarly, if we get P(✓), we win.

So, I think it's fine.

To be thorough, let's list all possible words: only ""state"", ""skate"", ""spate"".

So, I'll guess ""spate"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- The secret word has S in position 1 (from ""slate"" feedback: S(✓)).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed in all guesses).
- T is in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback: T(✓)).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed in all guesses).
- Therefore, the word pattern is S _ A T E, with only the second letter unknown.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, I, M, G, L (from all feedback).

The only possible common English words fitting this pattern and exclusions are:
- ""state"" (second letter T)
- ""skate"" (second letter K)
- ""spate"" (second letter P)

To resolve the unknown second letter, I chose ""spate"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the letter P, which hasn't been used in previous guesses and is not excluded.
- If P is correct (✓), the word is ""spate"".
- If P is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"", narrowing it down for the next guess.

<guess>spate</guess>",spate,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
  - So, A is in the word and in position 3, E is in the word and in position 5. C, R, N are not in the word.

- Guess 2: ""image"" -> I(x), M(x), A(✓), G(x), E(✓)
  - Confirms A and E in positions 3 and 5. I, M, G are not in the word.

- Guess 3: ""slate"" -> S(✓), L(x), A(✓), T(✓), E(✓)
  - S is in the word and in position 1 (since it's marked correct).
  - L is not in the word (x).
  - A is correct in position 3 (as before).
  - T is in the word and in position 4 (since marked correct).
  - E is correct in position 5.

So, from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has S in position 1, A in position 3, T in position 4, and E in position 5.
- Therefore, the word is S _ A T E, so the only unknown is the second letter.

- Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in the third position, T in the fourth, and E at the end. The second position must be a letter that is not in the excluded list and must form a valid English word.

The pattern is: S _ A T E

The second letter must be one that hasn't been excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we consider common ones).

Now, what are possible words that fit S _ A T E?

Common English words:
- State: S-T-A-T-E -> but T is at position 2? Let's check: 
  - Position 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> but we have T at position 4 already, and in ""slate"" we had T at position 4 correct, but in ""state"", position 2 is T and position 4 is T. However, in the feedback for ""slate"", L was not in the word, but T was correct at position 4. For ""state"", if we consider, but we haven't guessed it yet.

But we need to find words with pattern S _ A T E.

- ""State"" is S-T-A-T-E, which has position 2 as T. But in our pattern, position 4 is T, so if we have T at position 2, that might be possible if T is repeated? But we don't know if T can be repeated.

However, in the feedback from ""slate"", we have T at position 4 correct, but that doesn't say anything about T at other positions. But we know T is in the word at position 4, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback only tells us that T is in the word and at position 4 is correct. It doesn't prevent T from being in other positions.

But in ""slate"", we had T only at position 4, and it was marked correct, so we know T is in the word and position 4 is correct. But the word might have another T? We don't know.

However, for the pattern S _ A T E, the second position is unknown.

Possible words:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but position 4 is T, which we know is correct, and position 2 is also T. This is possible if the word has two T's.

But we need to check if T can be at position 2.

Other words:
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:K, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> this fits.
- ""Shate"" is not a word.
- ""Spute"" not a word.
- ""Slate"" we already guessed, but L is excluded and not in word.
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E -> a valid word, meaning a flood or rush.
- ""Stale"": S-T-A-L-E -> but L is excluded, and position 4 is L, but we know position 4 must be T, not L. ""Stale"" has position 4 as L, but we need T at position 4. So not.
- ""Scale"": has C and position 4 is L, not T, and C excluded.
- ""Soate"" not a word.

So, common words that fit S _ A T E:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E

Also, ""slate"" is out because L is excluded.

Now, are there others?
- ""Sware"": S-W-A-R-E -> but R is excluded, and position 4 is R? S-W-A-R-E, position 4 is R, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so no.
- ""Snate"" not a word.
- ""Svate"" not a word.

So, the main possibilities are ""state"", ""skate"", and ""spate"".

We need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish them.

But we have only one letter to determine: the second position.

We can guess any of them, but since we have multiple tries, we might guess one that tests the second letter.

But we know the pattern is fixed except for the second letter.

We can guess ""state"" directly.

But let's see the excluded letters: we have L excluded, but T is not excluded, so ""state"" is possible.

Similarly, K and P are not excluded.

In ""state"", the second letter is T. But we already know T is in the word at position 4. If we guess ""state"", and if the second letter is also T, it might be correct.

Similarly, for ""skate"", K is not excluded.

""Spate"" has P.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a letter not yet tested, but all letters except the second are fixed or known.

Since the only unknown is position 2, we can guess any word that fits the pattern and has a possible second letter.

But we have to avoid excluded letters for the second position.

Excluded: C,R,N,I,M,G,L.

So for second position, it can be: B,D,F,H,K,O,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But from common words, we have:
- T for ""state""
- K for ""skate""
- P for ""spate""

Also, ""shate"" not a word, ""swate"" not, etc.

Another word: ""suate"" not a word.

So only three common possibilities.

We can guess ""spate"" to test P.

But if we guess ""spate"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is not the second letter, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly, if we guess ""skate"", same thing.

But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess.

Since we have S,A,T,E fixed, and only second letter unknown, we can list the possible second letters that form words.

Possible: 
- With T: ""state""
- With K: ""skate""
- With P: ""spate""

Also, is there ""sbate""? Not a word.
""sd ate"" no.
""sfate"" no.
""shate"" no.
""soate"" no.
""suate"" no.
""svate"" no.
""swate"" no.
""sxate"" no.
""syate"" no.
""szate"" no.

So only T, K, P.

Now, we need to guess one.

To be efficient, we might choose one that is common, or we can use a word that includes other letters to test, but since all other positions are fixed, we cannot change them.

For example, we cannot change position 1,3,4,5 because they are known and correct.

So we must have S at 1, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

Therefore, the only flexibility is position 2.

So we must guess a word with one of the possible second letters.

We can guess ""spate"" for example.

But let's see the feedback from previous.

In guess 3, ""slate"" had S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓), so L is not in word, which is consistent.

Now, for the new guess, I'll go with ""spate"" to test P.

If P is in the word and at position 2, it will be correct. If not, we know P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly.

But to save a guess, if I guess ""state"", and if it's correct, I win in 4 guesses. If not, then it must be ""skate"" or ""spate"", but I can guess next.

But if I guess ""state"" and it's wrong, I know the second letter is not T, so it must be K or P.

Similarly.

Since we have three options, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think ""spate"" is a good choice because P hasn't been tested yet, while T has been tested (we know T is in the word at position 4, but we don't know about other positions).

In ""state"", we are testing if T is also at position 2.

Similarly, K hasn't been tested.

So, I'll guess ""spate"".

<guess>spate</guess>

But let's confirm: ""spate"" is S-P-A-T-E.

Positions: 1-S (should be correct), 2-P, 3-A (correct), 4-T (correct), 5-E (correct).

So feedback will show if P is correct or not.

If P is correct, we have the word. If not, then P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

But in the case P is not in the word at all, then it must be ""state"" or ""skate"", both of which don't have P.

Similarly, if P is in the word but wrong position, but since position 2 is the only position it could be, and if it's not correct there, it might not be in the word, or if it is, it must be at position 2, so if not correct, it's not in the word.

The feedback for position 2: if P is not in the word, it will be x. If it is in the word but wrong position, it would be -, but since the only unknown position is 2, and if P is in the word, it must be at position 2, so if it's not correct, it should be x, meaning not in the word.

Therefore, if we get P(x), then P is not in the word, so ""spate"" is invalid, and the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess ""skate"" next to test K.

Similarly, if we get P(✓), we win.

So, I think it's fine.

To be thorough, let's list all possible words: only ""state"", ""skate"", ""spate"".

So, I'll guess ""spate"".Based on the previous feedback:

- The secret word has S in position 1 (from ""slate"" feedback: S(✓)).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed in all guesses).
- T is in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback: T(✓)).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed in all guesses).
- Therefore, the word pattern is S _ A T E, with only the second letter unknown.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, I, M, G, L (from all feedback).

The only possible common English words fitting this pattern and exclusions are:
- ""state"" (second letter T)
- ""skate"" (second letter K)
- ""spate"" (second letter P)

To resolve the unknown second letter, I chose ""spate"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the letter P, which hasn't been used in previous guesses and is not excluded.
- If P is correct (✓), the word is ""spate"".
- If P is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"", narrowing it down for the next guess.",Guess 4: spate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,SKATE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle are words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the previous feedback was for my guess ""crane"". The feedback is:

- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A and E are in the word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is in position 3 (since it's the third letter in ""crane"") and E is in position 5 (last letter). Positions are 1-based: C is 1, R is 2, A is 3, N is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, in the secret word:
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.

Also, C, R, and N are not in the word at all. That means the secret word does not contain C, R, or N.

Now, I need to make a new guess. My new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Have A as the third letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Not contain C, R, or N.

Since A and E are fixed at positions 3 and 5, the word structure is _ _ A _ E.

I need to fill in the first, second, and fourth positions with letters that are not C, R, or N, and they must be possible letters that could be in the word.

Possible letters: Since C, R, N are out, and other letters could be in. I should try to use common letters to cover more possibilities.

Common vowels: A and E are already placed, but there might be more vowels. A and E are used, but I might include I, O, U.

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, but X and Z are less common.

I should aim for a word that has letters not yet tested to get new information.

Letters I haven't tested yet: I need to test other vowels and common consonants.

In position 3 and 5 fixed: A and E.

So words ending with A_E, like _ _ A _ E.

Now, guess a word that has A in third, E in fifth, and uses new letters.

Possible words: Let me brainstorm.

- Plate: P-L-A-T-E → positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Plate is a valid word. Does it contain forbidden letters? No C, R, or N.

But I don't know if L, P, T are in the word or not.

Instead, I should include other vowels like I or O in the positions to test.

For example, words like ""salve"": S-A-L-V-E → but A is position 2 here, not 3! I need A in position 3.

""_ _ A _ E"" pattern.

Common words:

- Whale: W-H-A-L-E → but position 3 is A, position 5 is E? Whale is W-H-A-L-E, so positions: 1-W, 2-H, 3-A, 4-L, 5-E — yes.

Whale has H, L, but L might be ok since N is forbidden, L is fine.

But I have no information about H or L yet.

Similarly, ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E → S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

""Share"": S-H-A-R-E — but R is forbidden! Feedback said R is not in the word, so I can't use R.

Share has R, which is excluded, so invalid for guessing because R is not in the word.

Similarly, ""care"" has C and R, both out.

So back to ""shade"": S, H, A, D, E

S, H, D are new letters.

""Plate"": P, L, A, T, E

P, L, T, new.

""Scale"": but C is forbidden, scale has C.

""Blame"": B-L-A-M-E → B(1), L(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) — B, L, M new.

""Flame"": F-L-A-M-E — similar.

""Glade"": G-L-A-D-E — G, L, D.

I need to choose one that maximizes new information.

Since positions 1,2,4 are unknown, I should include common letters that might appear.

For example, S is a very common letter; T is common; L is common.

Perhaps ""state"": S-T-A-T-E → but A is position 3, E position 5, but T in position 2 and 4.

""State"" S-T-A-T-E → positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

But T is repeated; it might be fine, but if T is not in word, it will show x, but since it's repeated, feedback might be tricky if T appears once only.

Wordle handles repeated letters, but for efficiency, better to avoid duplicates if possible, to test more distinct letters.

In this case, for ""state"", letters are S, T, A, E — A and E known, S and T to test.

But positions matter.

Better to have all different letters where possible.

""Whale"": W, H, A, L, E — letters: W,H,A,L,E — A and E known, W,H,L new.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D new.

""Plate"": P,L,A,T,E — P,L,T new.

Perhaps ""plate"" is good because L and T are common.

""Slate"": S-L-A-T-E — S,L,T new.

But ""slate"" has L and T.

Another option: ""saute"" — S-A-U-T-E — but A is position 2, not 3! Saute is S-A-U-T-E, so position 3 is U, so wrong pattern.

Must be _ _ A _ E.

""Spade"": S-P-A-D-E — S,P,D,E — E is position 5, A position 3.

Yes.

""Blade"": B-L-A-D-E — B,L,D.

I think ""plate"" or ""shade"" could be fine.

Let me choose ""plate"" for now.

In ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E

If I guess, and get feedback, I can learn about P, L, T.

In position 1: P

Position 2: L

Position 4: T

And A and E are fixed correct.

But feedback might show if P, L, T are in word or not, and if in position or wrong position.

Another word: ""beige"" — B-E-I-G-E — but A? No, third is I, not A.

Must have A in position 3.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E — U in pos 2? Positions: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) — yes, but Q is rare, and U, K.

Not ideal.

So better to stick with common letters.

""Grape"": G-R-A-P-E — but R is forbidden! R not in word.

Can't use.

""Bake"": B-A-K-E — only 4 letters? Must be 5-letter, so no.

""Shame"": S-H-A-M-E — S(1),H(2),A(3),M(4),E(5) — M new.

Also possible.

Among ""plate"", ""shade"", ""blame"", etc., all similar.

Perhaps I should include I or O to test for other vowels.

For example, ""oxide"": O-X-I-D-E — not A in position 3.

""A "" in position 3.

""Oasis"": O-A-S-I-S — positions: O(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5) — A is position 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Valid words: ""plane"" — P-L-A-N-E — but N is forbidden! Feedback said N not in word, and position 4 N.

Plane has N, which is excluded, so invalid guess because N is not in the secret word.

Similarly, ""crane"" had N, which is out.

So must avoid C,R,N.

Back to ""_ _ A _ E""

Let me list some options:

- place: P-L-A-C-E — C is forbidden! C not in word.

- trace: T-R-A-C-E — R and C forbidden.

- brake: B-R-A-K-E — R forbidden.

- flake: F-L-A-K-E — F(1),L(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — F,L,K new.

Flake is a word.

- snake: S-N-A-K-E — N forbidden.

- stake: S-T-A-K-E — S,T,K.

Stake: S(1),T(2),A(3),K(4),E(5) — S,T,K.

Spake not common, I think spake is archaic.

Glaze: G-L-A-Z-E — G,L,Z — Z less common.

Blare: B-L-A-R-E — R forbidden.

So ""flake"", ""stake"", ""shake"" — shake: S-H-A-K-E — H and K.

S, H, K.

Perhaps ""shake"" is good.

""Plate"" is P,L,A,T,E.

P, L, T.

Letters L and T are common.

""Shade"": S,H,A,D,E — S,H,D.

D is less common than L or T? D is fine.

Another word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.

""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.

No.

""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.

Must be third letter A.

So words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.

Perhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.

For example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.

Image: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.

I is a vowel, good to test.

Similarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.

Opaque is a word.

But less common.

""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.

""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.

Not.

So ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".

""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.

"" Plate"" has common consonants.

Since A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there's another vowel.

Previous guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.

Crane had vowels A,E.

C,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.

Now, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.

It might have no other vowels, or have I or O.

By using ""image"", I can test for I.

Similarly, ""oxide"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.

If A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.

But it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.

For example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.

But since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn't help much to have duplicate A.

Similarly, E is at end.

So better to avoid duplicates if possible.

"" Image"" no duplicates.

""Plate"" no duplicates.

I think I'll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.

""Image"": I-M-A-G-E

Positions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E

With A and E fixed correct.

So feedback will tell about I, M, G.

If I is in the word, if M, etc.

Also, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.

But ""image"" is fine.

To maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn't fit.

Another word: ""beige"" not A.

I think ""image"" is a valid choice.

Perhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.

Not matching.

So I'll guess ""image"".

But let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.

Since A and E are correct, they should show ✓.

In the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>

But first, I need to think step by step.

So thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).
- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.

For my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).

Considering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:
- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.
- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.
- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.

This guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.

<guess>image</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- From ""crane"": 
  - C: not in the word (x)
  - R: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3
  - N: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5

- From ""image"":
  - I: not in the word (x)
  - M: not in the word (x)
  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (as expected)
  - G: not in the word (x)
  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5 (as expected)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G
- Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, N, I, M, G.

The remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).

We need to make a new guess that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the available letters (avoiding C, R, N, I, M, G).

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Possible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters:

- We need words with 5 letters: first, second, and fourth positions to fill, with A at 3 and E at 5.

Common words:
- ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E -> but we have P, L, T. However, we haven't tested P, L, T yet. But in ""plate"", position 1 is P, 2 is L, 4 is T.
- ""shade"": S-H-A-D-E -> S, H, D
- ""stake"": S-T-A-K-E -> S, T, K
- ""blade"": B-L-A-D-E -> B, L, D
- ""flame"": F-L-A-M-E -> but M is excluded (from ""image"" feedback, M is not in the word), so invalid.
- ""shake"": S-H-A-K-E -> S, H, K
- ""spade"": S-P-A-D-E -> S, P, D
- ""glade"": G-L-A-D-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.
- ""beige"": doesn't fit pattern (A not at 3)
- ""alive"": A at position 1, not 3.

Since M and G are out, we avoid them.

Also, from ""crane"", we know C, R, N are out.

So, let's list possible words without C, R, N, I, M, G:

- ""plate"": uses P, L, T
- ""shade"": uses S, H, D
- ""stake"": uses S, T, K
- ""shake"": uses S, H, K
- ""spade"": uses S, P, D
- ""blade"": uses B, L, D
- ""flame"": invalid because M is out
- ""whale"": W-H-A-L-E -> W, H, L
- ""scale"": invalid, C is out
- ""brake"": invalid, R is out

We also have ""paste"": P-A-S-T-E -> but A is at position 2, not 3. We need A at position 3.

""Paste"" is P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> not, because position 3 is S, not A.

We need position 3 to be A.

So, ""plate"" is good: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

Similarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S, L, T.

""Slate"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: S, L, T are not excluded yet.

Excluded: C, R, N, I, M, G. So S, L, T are allowed.

Now, to choose a word that tests new letters effectively.

We have many options: we can test S, T, L, P, D, H, K, W, B, etc.

Since we have two positions to figure out (1,2,4) but position 4 is also unknown, we need to cover as many new letters as possible.

In the pattern _ _ A _ E, we have three positions: 1,2,4.

We should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids repeating known information.

For example, ""plate"" tests P, L, T.

""Shade"" tests S, H, D.

""Stake"" tests S, T, K.

""Whale"" tests W, H, L.

I think ""plate"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: P, L, T.

Alternatively, ""shade"" with S, H, D is also good.

But let's see if we can include a vowel. We know A and E are in, and I is out. So we might have O or U.

For example, ""soave"": S-O-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), O(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) -> but is ""soave"" a common word? It might be accepted, meaning a musical term or something, but perhaps not ideal.

""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E -> Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q and U are less common, and K is also not the most common.

""Blaze"": B-L-A-Z-E -> Z is less common.

So, sticking with more common words.

Another word: ""stage"": S-T-A-G-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.

""Space"": has C, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""plate"" is a solid choice.

But let's consider: if I use ""plate"", and if the secret word is, say, ""shade"", then I might not get much overlap.

But we need to test.

Perhaps ""stake"" to test S, T, K.

But K is less common than L or D.

""Shade"" has S, H, D.

H and D are both common.

I think I'll go with ""shade"" to test S, H, D.

""Shade"": S-H-A-D-E

Positions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-D, 5-E

If I guess this, feedback will tell me about S, H, D.

If S is in the word and correct position, or not, etc.

Similarly.

But we know A and E are correct, so they will be ✓.

So, I think it's fine.

To maximize vowel testing: we have A and E, I is out, so we might test O or U.

But in position 1 or 2 or 4.

For example, ""abode"" has A at position 1, not 3.

Not.

""Ozone"" not A.

""Alone"" has A at 1.

Not.

""Adobe"" A at 1.

Not.

So, it's hard to include O or U in this pattern without rare words.

""Quake"" is one, but Q and U.

I think for now, ""shade"" or ""plate"" is better.

I'll choose ""shade"".

But let's see the response format.

Another idea: since we have few letters left, we can think of possible words.

Possible secret words: must be _ _ A _ E, no C,R,N,I,M,G.

For example:
- ""shade"": S H A D E
- ""plate"": P L A T E
- ""stake"": S T A K E
- ""blade"": B L A D E
- ""whale"": W H A L E
- ""spade"": S P A D E
- ""shake"": S H A K E
- ""slate"": S L A T E
- ""brake"": has R, invalid
- ""flake"": F L A K E
- ""snake"": has N, invalid
- ""space"": has C, invalid

Also, ""beige"" not pattern.

So, by guessing ""shade"", if it's not correct, we can eliminate S, H, D or get clues.

Similarly for others.

I think ""shade"" is a good guess.

But in ""shade"", we have S, H, D to test.

If I guess ""plate"", I test P, L, T.

Both are fine.

Perhaps I can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities.

For example, in the list above, S appears in ""shade"", ""stake"", ""shake"", ""spade"", ""slate"".

L appears in ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"", ""slate"".

T appears in ""plate"", ""stake"", ""slate"".

So S and L are very common in the possibilities.

Therefore, guessing a word with S and L might be efficient.

For example, ""slate"": S-L-A-T-E

""Slate"" has S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

And it tests S, L, T.

If S is in the word, and if L is, etc.

Moreover, ""slate"" is a common starting word.

But we have constraints.

In this case, ""slate"" uses S, L, T, all new.

And it fits the pattern.

Also, it avoids excluded letters.

So, I think ""slate"" is a good choice.

Compared to ""shade"", which has S, H, D.

H and D might be less frequent than L and T? Not necessarily.

But ""slate"" covers more of the common possibilities.

For example, if S is not in the word, then many options like ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"" are still possible, but ""shade"", ""stake"", etc. would be eliminated.

Similarly, if L is not, then ""shade"", ""stake"", ""spade"" might be possible.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I'll go with ""slate"".

So, guess: ""slate""

<guess>slate</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, while C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From ""image"": I, M, and G are not in the word, confirming A and E are still correctly placed.

The secret word must follow the pattern _ _ A _ E and cannot contain C, R, N, I, M, or G. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess, I chose ""slate"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).
- It tests new common letters: S, L, and T, which appear frequently in potential solutions (e.g., ""plate"", ""blade"", ""stake"", ""shake"").
- It avoids duplicate letters and excluded letters, maximizing information gain about the remaining possibilities.

<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
  - So, A is in the word and in position 3, E is in the word and in position 5. C, R, N are not in the word.

- Guess 2: ""image"" -> I(x), M(x), A(✓), G(x), E(✓)
  - Confirms A and E in positions 3 and 5. I, M, G are not in the word.

- Guess 3: ""slate"" -> S(✓), L(x), A(✓), T(✓), E(✓)
  - S is in the word and in position 1 (since it's marked correct).
  - L is not in the word (x).
  - A is correct in position 3 (as before).
  - T is in the word and in position 4 (since marked correct).
  - E is correct in position 5.

So, from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has S in position 1, A in position 3, T in position 4, and E in position 5.
- Therefore, the word is S _ A T E, so the only unknown is the second letter.

- Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A in the third position, T in the fourth, and E at the end. The second position must be a letter that is not in the excluded list and must form a valid English word.

The pattern is: S _ A T E

The second letter must be one that hasn't been excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we consider common ones).

Now, what are possible words that fit S _ A T E?

Common English words:
- State: S-T-A-T-E -> but T is at position 2? Let's check: 
  - Position 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> but we have T at position 4 already, and in ""slate"" we had T at position 4 correct, but in ""state"", position 2 is T and position 4 is T. However, in the feedback for ""slate"", L was not in the word, but T was correct at position 4. For ""state"", if we consider, but we haven't guessed it yet.

But we need to find words with pattern S _ A T E.

- ""State"" is S-T-A-T-E, which has position 2 as T. But in our pattern, position 4 is T, so if we have T at position 2, that might be possible if T is repeated? But we don't know if T can be repeated.

However, in the feedback from ""slate"", we have T at position 4 correct, but that doesn't say anything about T at other positions. But we know T is in the word at position 4, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback only tells us that T is in the word and at position 4 is correct. It doesn't prevent T from being in other positions.

But in ""slate"", we had T only at position 4, and it was marked correct, so we know T is in the word and position 4 is correct. But the word might have another T? We don't know.

However, for the pattern S _ A T E, the second position is unknown.

Possible words:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but position 4 is T, which we know is correct, and position 2 is also T. This is possible if the word has two T's.

But we need to check if T can be at position 2.

Other words:
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:K, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> this fits.
- ""Shate"" is not a word.
- ""Spute"" not a word.
- ""Slate"" we already guessed, but L is excluded and not in word.
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E -> a valid word, meaning a flood or rush.
- ""Stale"": S-T-A-L-E -> but L is excluded, and position 4 is L, but we know position 4 must be T, not L. ""Stale"" has position 4 as L, but we need T at position 4. So not.
- ""Scale"": has C and position 4 is L, not T, and C excluded.
- ""Soate"" not a word.

So, common words that fit S _ A T E:
- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E
- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E
- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E

Also, ""slate"" is out because L is excluded.

Now, are there others?
- ""Sware"": S-W-A-R-E -> but R is excluded, and position 4 is R? S-W-A-R-E, position 4 is R, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so no.
- ""Snate"" not a word.
- ""Svate"" not a word.

So, the main possibilities are ""state"", ""skate"", and ""spate"".

We need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish them.

But we have only one letter to determine: the second position.

We can guess any of them, but since we have multiple tries, we might guess one that tests the second letter.

But we know the pattern is fixed except for the second letter.

We can guess ""state"" directly.

But let's see the excluded letters: we have L excluded, but T is not excluded, so ""state"" is possible.

Similarly, K and P are not excluded.

In ""state"", the second letter is T. But we already know T is in the word at position 4. If we guess ""state"", and if the second letter is also T, it might be correct.

Similarly, for ""skate"", K is not excluded.

""Spate"" has P.

Now, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a letter not yet tested, but all letters except the second are fixed or known.

Since the only unknown is position 2, we can guess any word that fits the pattern and has a possible second letter.

But we have to avoid excluded letters for the second position.

Excluded: C,R,N,I,M,G,L.

So for second position, it can be: B,D,F,H,K,O,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But from common words, we have:
- T for ""state""
- K for ""skate""
- P for ""spate""

Also, ""shate"" not a word, ""swate"" not, etc.

Another word: ""suate"" not a word.

So only three common possibilities.

We can guess ""spate"" to test P.

But if we guess ""spate"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we know P is not the second letter, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly, if we guess ""skate"", same thing.

But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess.

Since we have S,A,T,E fixed, and only second letter unknown, we can list the possible second letters that form words.

Possible: 
- With T: ""state""
- With K: ""skate""
- With P: ""spate""

Also, is there ""sbate""? Not a word.
""sd ate"" no.
""sfate"" no.
""shate"" no.
""soate"" no.
""suate"" no.
""svate"" no.
""swate"" no.
""sxate"" no.
""syate"" no.
""szate"" no.

So only T, K, P.

Now, we need to guess one.

To be efficient, we might choose one that is common, or we can use a word that includes other letters to test, but since all other positions are fixed, we cannot change them.

For example, we cannot change position 1,3,4,5 because they are known and correct.

So we must have S at 1, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.

Therefore, the only flexibility is position 2.

So we must guess a word with one of the possible second letters.

We can guess ""spate"" for example.

But let's see the feedback from previous.

In guess 3, ""slate"" had S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓), so L is not in word, which is consistent.

Now, for the new guess, I'll go with ""spate"" to test P.

If P is in the word and at position 2, it will be correct. If not, we know P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Similarly.

But to save a guess, if I guess ""state"", and if it's correct, I win in 4 guesses. If not, then it must be ""skate"" or ""spate"", but I can guess next.

But if I guess ""state"" and it's wrong, I know the second letter is not T, so it must be K or P.

Similarly.

Since we have three options, we can choose arbitrarily.

I think ""spate"" is a good choice because P hasn't been tested yet, while T has been tested (we know T is in the word at position 4, but we don't know about other positions).

In ""state"", we are testing if T is also at position 2.

Similarly, K hasn't been tested.

So, I'll guess ""spate"".

<guess>spate</guess>

But let's confirm: ""spate"" is S-P-A-T-E.

Positions: 1-S (should be correct), 2-P, 3-A (correct), 4-T (correct), 5-E (correct).

So feedback will show if P is correct or not.

If P is correct, we have the word. If not, then P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

But in the case P is not in the word at all, then it must be ""state"" or ""skate"", both of which don't have P.

Similarly, if P is in the word but wrong position, but since position 2 is the only position it could be, and if it's not correct there, it might not be in the word, or if it is, it must be at position 2, so if not correct, it's not in the word.

The feedback for position 2: if P is not in the word, it will be x. If it is in the word but wrong position, it would be -, but since the only unknown position is 2, and if P is in the word, it must be at position 2, so if it's not correct, it should be x, meaning not in the word.

Therefore, if we get P(x), then P is not in the word, so ""spate"" is invalid, and the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".

Then we can guess ""skate"" next to test K.

Similarly, if we get P(✓), we win.

So, I think it's fine.

To be thorough, let's list all possible words: only ""state"", ""skate"", ""spate"".

So, I'll guess ""spate"".Based on the previous feedback:

- The secret word has S in position 1 (from ""slate"" feedback: S(✓)).
- A is in position 3 (confirmed in all guesses).
- T is in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback: T(✓)).
- E is in position 5 (confirmed in all guesses).
- Therefore, the word pattern is S _ A T E, with only the second letter unknown.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, I, M, G, L (from all feedback).

The only possible common English words fitting this pattern and exclusions are:
- ""state"" (second letter T)
- ""skate"" (second letter K)
- ""spate"" (second letter P)

To resolve the unknown second letter, I chose ""spate"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the letter P, which hasn't been used in previous guesses and is not excluded.
- If P is correct (✓), the word is ""spate"".
- If P is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"", narrowing it down for the next guess.

D is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""scale"" — C forbidden.\n\n""Space"" — P not S, space is S-P-A-C-E — C forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""Alike"" : A-L-I-K-E — A is position 1, not 3.\n\nMust be third letter A.\n\nSo words like XXXXX where third is A and fifth is E.\n\nPerhaps I should use a word with I in another position to test if I is in the word.\n\nFor example, in position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nSay, ""image"": I-M-A-G-E — positions: I(1),M(2),A(3),G(4),E(5) — yes.\n\nImage: I, M, A, G, E — A and E fixed, I, M, G new.\n\nI is a vowel, good to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""opaque"": O-P-A-U-E — not, position 5 is E, but U at 4? O-P-A-U-E so position 3 A, 4 U, 5 E — yes, but U and E.\n\nOpaque is a word.\n\nBut less common.\n\n""Elite"" — not A in 3rd.\n\n""Alive"": A-L-I-V-E — A at position 1.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""image"" or ""plate"" or ""stake"".\n\n""Image"" has I, which is another vowel, and G, M.\n\n"" Plate"" has common consonants.\n\nSince A and E are vowels, testing consonants might be better, or test if there\'s another vowel.\n\nPrevious guess ""crane"" had consonants C,R,N which are out, but vowels A,E in.\n\nCrane had vowels A,E.\n\nC,A,R,N,E — vowels A and E, both are in and correct positions for A and E.\n\nNow, the secret word has at least A and E, and possibly other vowels.\n\nIt might have no other vowels, or have I or O.\n\nBy using ""image"", I can test for I.\n\nSimilarly, ""oxide"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""agape"" — A-G-A-P-E — positions: A(1),G(2),A(3),P(4),E(5) — A repeated, position 3 is A, good, but position 1 also A.\n\nIf A is only at position 3, feedback might show first A not correct, since only position 3 has A.\n\nBut it could be used, but duplicate letters might confuse feedback.\n\nFor example, if secret word has only one A, then for ""agape"", position 1 A might be x, position 3 A ✓, position 4 P x or -, E ✓.\n\nBut since we know position 3 A is correct, it doesn\'t help much to have duplicate A.\n\nSimilarly, E is at end.\n\nSo better to avoid duplicates if possible.\n\n"" Image"" no duplicates.\n\n""Plate"" no duplicates.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""image"" to test the letter I and other consonants.\n\n""Image"": I-M-A-G-E\n\nPositions: 1-I, 2-M, 3-A, 4-G, 5-E\n\nWith A and E fixed correct.\n\nSo feedback will tell about I, M, G.\n\nIf I is in the word, if M, etc.\n\nAlso, since I is at position 1, if I is in the word but wrong position, or not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps ""stake"" or ""shake"" might be better for common letters.\n\nBut ""image"" is fine.\n\nTo maximize coverage, ""audio"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother word: ""beige"" not A.\n\nI think ""image"" is a valid choice.\n\nPerhaps ""alone"" — A-L-O-N-E — but N forbidden, and A is position 1, not 3.\n\nNot.\n\n""Adobe"" — A-D-O-B-E — position 1 A, not 3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""image"".\n\nBut let me confirm: feedback will show which of I,M,G are correct or not.\n\nSince A and E are correct, they should show ✓.\n\nIn the response format, I need to output <guess>image</guess>\n\nBut first, I need to think step by step.\n\nSo thought process: Based on previous feedback, A is in position 3, E is in position 5, and C,R,N are not in the word. Therefore, new word must have A in position 3, E in position 5, and exclude C,R,N. I choose ""image"" to test for the vowel I and letters M and G.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- For guess ""crane"": C(x) means C is not in the word, R(x) means R is not in the word, A(✓) means A is in the correct position (position 3), N(x) means N is not in the word, E(✓) means E is in the correct position (position 5).\n- The secret word has A at position 3 and E at position 5, so it follows the pattern _ _ A _ E.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word, so they must be excluded from the new guess.\n\nFor my next guess, I need a valid 5-letter English word with A in position 3 and E in position 5, and no C, R, or N. I also want to test new letters to gain more information, focusing on common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out (like I, O, or common consonants such as S, T, L).\n\nConsidering words like ""plate"" (P, L, T), ""shade"" (S, H, D), ""stake"" (S, T, K), ""flake"" (F, L, K), or ""image"" (I, M, G). I choose ""image"" because:\n- It introduces the vowel I (testing if I is in the word) and consonants M and G, which are common and not excluded.\n- It avoids duplicate letters, which simplifies feedback interpretation.\n- The word ""image"" (I-M-A-G-E) fits the pattern, with A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nThis guess will help identify if I, M, or G are present and their positions, narrowing down the possible secret words.\n\n<guess>image</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From ""crane"": \n  - C: not in the word (x)\n  - R: not in the word (x)\n  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3\n  - N: not in the word (x)\n  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5\n\n- From ""image"":\n  - I: not in the word (x)\n  - M: not in the word (x)\n  - A: correct position (✓) at position 3 (as expected)\n  - G: not in the word (x)\n  - E: correct position (✓) at position 5 (as expected)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, I, M, G\n- Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding C, R, N, I, M, G.\n\nThe remaining letters are: B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones).\n\nWe need to make a new guess that fits _ _ A _ E and uses only the available letters (avoiding C, R, N, I, M, G).\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern and avoid the excluded letters:\n\n- We need words with 5 letters: first, second, and fourth positions to fill, with A at 3 and E at 5.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""plate"": P-L-A-T-E -> but we have P, L, T.

We need A at position 3.\n\n""Paste"" is P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), E(5) -> not, because position 3 is S, not A.\n\nWe need position 3 to be A.\n\nSo, ""plate"" is good: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)\n\nSimilarly, ""slate"": S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> but S, L, T.\n\n""Slate"" is a common word.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: S, L, T are not excluded yet.\n\nExcluded: C, R, N, I, M, G. So S, L, T are allowed.\n\nNow, to choose a word that tests new letters effectively.\n\nWe have many options: we can test S, T, L, P, D, H, K, W, B, etc.\n\nSince we have two positions to figure out (1,2,4) but position 4 is also unknown, we need to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn the pattern _ _ A _ E, we have three positions: 1,2,4.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters and avoids repeating known information.\n\nFor example, ""plate"" tests P, L, T.\n\n""Shade"" tests S, H, D.\n\n""Stake"" tests S, T, K.\n\n""Whale"" tests W, H, L.\n\nI think ""plate"" is a good choice because it uses three common letters: P, L, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""shade"" with S, H, D is also good.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include a vowel. We know A and E are in, and I is out. So we might have O or U.\n\nFor example, ""soave"": S-O-A-V-E -> positions: S(1), O(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) -> but is ""soave"" a common word? It might be accepted, meaning a musical term or something, but perhaps not ideal.\n\n""Quake"": Q-U-A-K-E -> Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q and U are less common, and K is also not the most common.\n\n""Blaze"": B-L-A-Z-E -> Z is less common.\n\nSo, sticking with more common words.\n\nAnother word: ""stage"": S-T-A-G-E -> but G is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""Space"": has C, invalid.\n\nTherefore, I think ""plate"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if I use ""plate"", and if the secret word is, say, ""shade"", then I might not get much overlap.\n\nBut we need to test.\n\nPerhaps ""stake"" to test S, T, K.\n\nBut K is less common than L or D.\n\n""Shade"" has S, H, D.\n\nH and D are both common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""shade"" to test S, H, D.\n\n""Shade"": S-H-A-D-E\n\nPositions: 1-S, 2-H, 3-A, 4-D, 5-E\n\nIf I guess this, feedback will tell me about S, H, D.\n\nIf S is in the word and correct position, or not, etc.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we know A and E are correct, so they will be ✓.\n\nSo, I think it\'s fine.\n\nTo maximize vowel testing: we have A and E, I is out, so we might test O or U.\n\nBut in position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""abode"" has A at position 1, not 3.\n\nNot.\n\n""Ozone"" not A.\n\n""Alone"" has A at 1.\n\nNot.\n\n""Adobe"" A at 1.\n\nNot.\n\nSo, it\'s hard to include O or U in this pattern without rare words.\n\n""Quake"" is one, but Q and U.\n\nI think for now, ""shade"" or ""plate"" is better.\n\nI\'ll choose ""shade"".\n\nBut let\'s see the response format.\n\nAnother idea: since we have few letters left, we can think of possible words.\n\nPossible secret words: must be _ _ A _ E, no C,R,N,I,M,G.\n\nFor example:\n- ""shade"": S H A D E\n- ""plate"": P L A T E\n- ""stake"": S T A K E\n- ""blade"": B L A D E\n- ""whale"": W H A L E\n- ""spade"": S P A D E\n- ""shake"": S H A K E\n- ""slate"": S L A T E\n- ""brake"": has R, invalid\n- ""flake"": F L A K E\n- ""snake"": has N, invalid\n- ""space"": has C, invalid\n\nAlso, ""beige"" not pattern.\n\nSo, by guessing ""shade"", if it\'s not correct, we can eliminate S, H, D or get clues.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think ""shade"" is a good guess.\n\nBut in ""shade"", we have S, H, D to test.\n\nIf I guess ""plate"", I test P, L, T.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nPerhaps I can choose a word that has letters that appear in multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, in the list above, S appears in ""shade"", ""stake"", ""shake"", ""spade"", ""slate"".\n\nL appears in ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"", ""slate"".\n\nT appears in ""plate"", ""stake"", ""slate"".\n\nSo S and L are very common in the possibilities.\n\nTherefore, guessing a word with S and L might be efficient.\n\nFor example, ""slate"": S-L-A-T-E\n\n""Slate"" has S at 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nAnd it tests S, L, T.\n\nIf S is in the word, and if L is, etc.\n\nMoreover, ""slate"" is a common starting word.\n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nIn this case, ""slate"" uses S, L, T, all new.\n\nAnd it fits the pattern.\n\nAlso, it avoids excluded letters.\n\nSo, I think ""slate"" is a good choice.\n\nCompared to ""shade"", which has S, H, D.\n\nH and D might be less frequent than L and T? Not necessarily.\n\nBut ""slate"" covers more of the common possibilities.\n\nFor example, if S is not in the word, then many options like ""plate"", ""blade"", ""whale"", ""flake"" are still possible, but ""shade"", ""stake"", etc. would be eliminated.\n\nSimilarly, if L is not, then ""shade"", ""stake"", ""spade"" might be possible.\n\nBut let\'s not overcomplicate.\n\nI\'ll go with ""slate"".\n\nSo, guess: ""slate""\n\n<guess>slate</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From ""crane"": A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, while C, R, and N are not in the word.\n- From ""image"": I, M, and G are not in the word, confirming A and E are still correctly placed.\n\nThe secret word must follow the pattern _ _ A _ E and cannot contain C, R, N, I, M, or G. This leaves possible letters like B, D, F, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess, I chose ""slate"" because:\n- It fits the pattern _ _ A _ E (S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5).\n- It tests new common letters: S, L, and T, which appear frequently in potential solutions (e.g., ""plate"", ""blade"", ""stake"", ""shake"").\n- It avoids duplicate letters and excluded letters, maximizing information gain about the remaining possibilities.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)\n  - So, A is in the word and in position 3, E is in the word and in position 5.

The second position must be a letter that is not in the excluded list and must form a valid English word.\n\nThe pattern is: S _ A T E\n\nThe second letter must be one that hasn\'t been excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, I, M, G, L.\n\nRemaining possible letters: B, D, F, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but we consider common ones).\n\nNow, what are possible words that fit S _ A T E?\n\nCommon English words:\n- State: S-T-A-T-E -> but T is at position 2? Let\'s check: \n  - Position 1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> but we have T at position 4 already, and in ""slate"" we had T at position 4 correct, but in ""state"", position 2 is T and position 4 is T. However, in the feedback for ""slate"", L was not in the word, but T was correct at position 4. For ""state"", if we consider, but we haven\'t guessed it yet.\n\nBut we need to find words with pattern S _ A T E.\n\n- ""State"" is S-T-A-T-E, which has position 2 as T. But in our pattern, position 4 is T, so if we have T at position 2, that might be possible if T is repeated? But we don\'t know if T can be repeated.\n\nHowever, in the feedback from ""slate"", we have T at position 4 correct, but that doesn\'t say anything about T at other positions. But we know T is in the word at position 4, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback only tells us that T is in the word and at position 4 is correct. It doesn\'t prevent T from being in other positions.\n\nBut in ""slate"", we had T only at position 4, and it was marked correct, so we know T is in the word and position 4 is correct. But the word might have another T? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, for the pattern S _ A T E, the second position is unknown.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> but position 4 is T, which we know is correct, and position 2 is also T. This is possible if the word has two T\'s.\n\nBut we need to check if T can be at position 2.\n\nOther words:\n- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> positions: 1:S, 2:K, 3:A, 4:T, 5:E -> this fits.\n- ""Shate"" is not a word.\n- ""Spute"" not a word.\n- ""Slate"" we already guessed, but L is excluded and not in word.\n- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E -> a valid word, meaning a flood or rush.\n- ""Stale"": S-T-A-L-E -> but L is excluded, and position 4 is L, but we know position 4 must be T, not L. ""Stale"" has position 4 as L, but we need T at position 4. So not.\n- ""Scale"": has C and position 4 is L, not T, and C excluded.\n- ""Soate"" not a word.\n\nSo, common words that fit S _ A T E:\n- ""State"": S-T-A-T-E\n- ""Skate"": S-K-A-T-E\n- ""Spate"": S-P-A-T-E\n\nAlso, ""slate"" is out because L is excluded.\n\nNow, are there others?\n- ""Sware"": S-W-A-R-E -> but R is excluded, and position 4 is R? S-W-A-R-E, position 4 is R, not T. We need position 4 to be T, so no.\n- ""Snate"" not a word.\n- ""Svate"" not a word.\n\nSo, the main possibilities are ""state"", ""skate"", and ""spate"".\n\nWe need to guess one of these or a word that can distinguish them.\n\nBut we have only one letter to determine: the second position.\n\nWe can guess any of them, but since we have multiple tries, we might guess one that tests the second letter.\n\nBut we know the pattern is fixed except for the second letter.\n\nWe can guess ""state"" directly.\n\nBut let\'s see the excluded letters: we have L excluded, but T is not excluded, so ""state"" is possible.\n\nSimilarly, K and P are not excluded.\n\nIn ""state"", the second letter is T. But we already know T is in the word at position 4. If we guess ""state"", and if the second letter is also T, it might be correct.\n\nSimilarly, for ""skate"", K is not excluded.\n\n""Spate"" has P.\n\nNow, to choose which one to guess, we can pick one that uses a letter not yet tested, but all letters except the second are fixed or known.\n\nSince the only unknown is position 2, we can guess any word that fits the pattern and has a possible second letter.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters for the second position.\n\nExcluded: C,R,N,I,M,G,L.\n\nSo for second position, it can be: B,D,F,H,K,O,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nBut from common words, we have:\n- T for ""state""\n- K for ""skate""\n- P for ""spate""\n\nAlso, ""shate"" not a word, ""swate"" not, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""suate"" not a word.\n\nSo only three common possibilities.\n\nWe can guess ""spate"" to test P.\n\nBut if we guess ""spate"", and if it\'s correct, we win. If not, we know P is not the second letter, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""skate"", same thing.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess.\n\nSince we have S,A,T,E fixed, and only second letter unknown, we can list the possible second letters that form words.\n\nPossible: \n- With T: ""state""\n- With K: ""skate""\n- With P: ""spate""\n\nAlso, is there ""sbate""? Not a word.\n""sd ate"" no.\n""sfate"" no.\n""shate"" no.\n""soate"" no.\n""suate"" no.\n""svate"" no.\n""swate"" no.\n""sxate"" no.\n""syate"" no.\n""szate"" no.\n\nSo only T, K, P.\n\nNow, we need to guess one.\n\nTo be efficient, we might choose one that is common, or we can use a word that includes other letters to test, but since all other positions are fixed, we cannot change them.\n\nFor example, we cannot change position 1,3,4,5 because they are known and correct.\n\nSo we must have S at 1, A at 3, T at 4, E at 5.\n\nTherefore, the only flexibility is position 2.\n\nSo we must guess a word with one of the possible second letters.\n\nWe can guess ""spate"" for example.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from previous.\n\nIn guess 3, ""slate"" had S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓), so L is not in word, which is consistent.\n\nNow, for the new guess, I\'ll go with ""spate"" to test P.\n\nIf P is in the word and at position 2, it will be correct. If not, we know P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so it must be ""state"" or ""skate"".\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to save a guess, if I guess ""state"", and if it\'s correct, I win in 4 guesses. If not, then it must be ""skate"" or ""spate"", but I can guess next.\n\nBut if I guess ""state"" and it\'s wrong, I know the second letter is not T, so it must be K or P.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSince we have three options, we can choose arbitrarily.\n\nI think ""spate"" is a good choice because P hasn\'t been tested yet, while T has been tested (we know T is in the word at position 4, but we don\'t know about other positions).\n\nIn ""state"", we are testing if T is also at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, K hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""spate"".\n\n<guess>spate</guess>\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""spate"" is S-P-A-T-E.\n\nPositions: 1-S (should be correct), 2-P, 3-A (correct), 4-T (correct), 5-E (correct).\n\nSo feedback will show if P is correct or not.\n\nIf P is correct, we have the word. If not, then P is not in the word or not at position 2, but since position 2 is the only unknown, if P is not correct, then ""spate"" is not the word, so the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".\n\nThen we can guess accordingly.\n\nBut in the case P is not in the word at all, then it must be ""state"" or ""skate"", both of which don\'t have P.\n\nSimilarly, if P is in the word but wrong position, but since position 2 is the only position it could be, and if it\'s not correct there, it might not be in the word, or if it is, it must be at position 2, so if not correct, it\'s not in the word.\n\nThe feedback for position 2: if P is not in the word, it will be x. If it is in the word but wrong position, it would be -, but since the only unknown position is 2, and if P is in the word, it must be at position 2, so if it\'s not correct, it should be x, meaning not in the word.\n\nTherefore, if we get P(x), then P is not in the word, so ""spate"" is invalid, and the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"".\n\nThen we can guess ""skate"" next to test K.\n\nSimilarly, if we get P(✓), we win.\n\nSo, I think it\'s fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let\'s list all possible words: only ""state"", ""skate"", ""spate"".\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""spate"".Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- The secret word has S in position 1 (from ""slate"" feedback: S(✓)).\n- A is in position 3 (confirmed in all guesses).\n- T is in position 4 (from ""slate"" feedback: T(✓)).\n- E is in position 5 (confirmed in all guesses).\n- Therefore, the word pattern is S _ A T E, with only the second letter unknown.\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, I, M, G, L (from all feedback).\n\nThe only possible common English words fitting this pattern and exclusions are:\n- ""state"" (second letter T)\n- ""skate"" (second letter K)\n- ""spate"" (second letter P)\n\nTo resolve the unknown second letter, I chose ""spate"" as the next guess because:\n- It tests the letter P, which hasn\'t been used in previous guesses and is not excluded.\n- If P is correct (✓), the word is ""spate"".\n- If P is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" or ""skate"", narrowing it down for the next guess.\n\n<guess>spate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 4: spate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 4: ""spate"" had S(✓) P(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓). This tells us:
  - S is correct and in position 1.
  - P is not in the word at all (x).
  - A is correct in position 3.
  - T is correct in position 4.
  - E is correct in position 5.

From all feedback:
- The secret word is S _ A T E (position 1: S, position 3: A, position 4: T, position 5: E). Only position 2 is unknown.
- Excluded letters (not in the word): C, R, N, I, M, G, L (from previous guesses) and now P is also excluded from ""spate"" feedback.
- Possible second letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the above.

Remaining possible common letters: B, D, F, H, K, O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need a valid English word of the form S _ A T E.

Possible words:
- ""state"" - S T A T E (second letter T) → but P is excluded, but T isn't; however, we know T is in position 4, and T could appear again.
- ""skate"" - S K A T E (second letter K)
- ""spate"" was guessed and P is not in the word, so invalid.
- Other options: ""shate"" (not a word), ""suate"" (not a word), ""swate"" (not a word), etc.

Only common valid words are ""state"" and ""skate"".

Now:
- ""state"" has T as the second letter. We know T is in the word (from position 4), so it's possible for T to be at position 2 as well.
- ""skate"" has K as the second letter.

We now have only two possibilities: ""state"" or ""skate"".

To decide, we must guess one of them.

Since ""spate"" was incorrect, and only these two remain, we can guess ""skate"" to test K.

If we guess ""skate"":
- If K is correct, then the word is ""skate"".
- If K is wrong (x), then the word must be ""state"".

Similarly, if we guess ""state"" and it's correct, we win; if not, then ""skate"" is the word.

Arbitrarily, I choose ""skate"" to test a new letter K, which hasn't been used yet.

So, new guess: ""skate"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback and cumulative deductions:
- The secret word is confirmed to have S in position 1, A in position 3, T in position 4, and E in position 5, resulting in the pattern S _ A T E.
- Letters not in the word (from all feedback): C, R, N, I, M, G, L, P.
- The only remaining common English words fitting this pattern are ""state"" (second letter T) and ""skate"" (second letter K).

I chose ""skate"" for the new guess because:
- It tests K in the second position—a new letter not yet evaluated.
- If K is correct (✓), the word is ""skate"".
- If K is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" (as T can be duplicated).

But we need a valid English word of the form S _ A T E.

Possible words:
- ""state"" - S T A T E (second letter T) → but P is excluded, but T isn't; however, we know T is in position 4, and T could appear again.
- ""skate"" - S K A T E (second letter K)
- ""spate"" was guessed and P is not in the word, so invalid.
- Other options: ""shate"" (not a word), ""suate"" (not a word), ""swate"" (not a word), etc.

Only common valid words are ""state"" and ""skate"".

Now:
- ""state"" has T as the second letter. We know T is in the word (from position 4), so it's possible for T to be at position 2 as well.
- ""skate"" has K as the second letter.

We now have only two possibilities: ""state"" or ""skate"".

To decide, we must guess one of them.

Since ""spate"" was incorrect, and only these two remain, we can guess ""skate"" to test K.

If we guess ""skate"":
- If K is correct, then the word is ""skate"".
- If K is wrong (x), then the word must be ""state"".

Similarly, if we guess ""state"" and it's correct, we win; if not, then ""skate"" is the word.

Arbitrarily, I choose ""skate"" to test a new letter K, which hasn't been used yet.

So, new guess: ""skate"".Based on the previous feedback and cumulative deductions:
- The secret word is confirmed to have S in position 1, A in position 3, T in position 4, and E in position 5, resulting in the pattern S _ A T E.
- Letters not in the word (from all feedback): C, R, N, I, M, G, L, P.
- The only remaining common English words fitting this pattern are ""state"" (second letter T) and ""skate"" (second letter K).

I chose ""skate"" for the new guess because:
- It tests K in the second position—a new letter not yet evaluated.
- If K is correct (✓), the word is ""skate"".
- If K is incorrect (x), the word must be ""state"" (as T can be duplicated).",Guess 5: skate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
