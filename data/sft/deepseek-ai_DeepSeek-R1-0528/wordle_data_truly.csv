We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in subsequent guesses.

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- We can try words like ""PRISM"", ""TRIPS"", ""DRINK"", ""GRIND"", etc.

But note: we have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and use other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding A, E, and also C, N). The vowels we can use are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

Some options:
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.
- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> again, C is not allowed.
- ""TRICK"": same issue.

We must avoid C. So let's avoid words with C.

Try words without C, A, N, E.

Example: ""DROPS"" -> D, R, O, P, S. This avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we don't know if D, O, P, S are in the word. This could be a good guess.

Another option: ""GRIMY"" -> G, R, I, M, Y. This uses Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

Alternatively: ""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M. This avoids the forbidden letters.

We can also consider ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. Using more common letters is better.

Let's list the most common consonants: S, T, R (we already have R), L, P, M, D, etc.

And vowels: O, I, U.

We already have R fixed in position 2.

So, a good guess might be ""PRISM"" because it has P, R, I, S, M. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" has T, R, I, P, S.

But note: in ""TRIPS"", T is the first letter, R second, I third, P fourth, S fifth.

We don't know if T, I, P, S are in the word.

Similarly, ""PRISM"" has P, R, I, S, M.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PRISM"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. But it has two D's and U and I. Also, D is common.

But ""PRISM"" seems better because it has more common letters.

We can also consider ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T. But note: R is in the second position? In ""SHIRT"", R is the fourth letter. We need R in the second position.

So, we must have a word with R as the second letter.

Therefore, ""SHIRT"" would not work because R is the fourth.

We need words of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

So, let's stick with ""PRISM"".

But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we have 22 letters left.

We can also try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L. This avoids the forbidden letters.

""BROIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""GROIN"": G, R, O, I, N -> but N is forbidden! We know N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""DRAIN"" has A and N, which are forbidden.

So, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

Therefore, ""BROIL"" is acceptable: B, R, O, I, L.

But ""PRISM"" is also acceptable.

I think both are good. Let's choose one that maximizes new letters.

We haven't tried P, I, S, M or B, O, I, L.

Since we have no information about the other positions, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""PRISM"" because it includes S and M, which are very common.

So, my second guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

After thinking, I decide to guess ""PRISM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The second letter is R and is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x).

The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it cannot contain C, A, N, or E.

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"" because:
- It has R as the second letter, maintaining the known correct position.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, S, M) to test their presence and positions.
- ""Prism"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

We have the following feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": 
   - C: not in word (x)
   - R: correct and in position (✓) -> so the second letter is R.
   - A: not in word (x)
   - N: not in word (x)
   - E: not in word (x)

2. For ""prism"":
   - P: not in word (x)
   - R: correct and in position (✓) -> second letter is R (already known)
   - I: not in word (x)
   - S: not in word (x)
   - M: not in word (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

And the eliminated letters are: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

We have 18 letters left in the alphabet (26 - 8 = 18) that could be in the word. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we haven't encountered any yet. Since we don't have any indication of duplicates, we'll assume for now that we can avoid them, but we must be cautious.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to use a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

We also want to cover as many common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters among the remaining: T, L, O, D, H, G, B, etc.

We can try to form a word with R in the second position and using common letters.

Possible words:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> but has two T's? And T is common. However, we don't know if T is in the word. Also, O and U are vowels we haven't tried.
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> similar.
- ""DROUGHT"": too long, we need 5 letters.
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.
- ""BROWL"": B, R, O, W, L -> this is a word? ""Browl"" is not common. Let me check: actually, ""brawl"" is a word, but that has A (eliminated). ""BROIL"" was considered earlier but now I is eliminated.

We must avoid I as well.

Let's list some words that fit:

- ""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> has double L. But we don't know if L is in the word. Also, double letters might be less informative.
- ""TROOP"": T, R, O, O, P -> but P is eliminated (from prism feedback).
- ""DROLL"": D, R, O, L, L -> again double L.

We need words without eliminated letters and without repeating letters if possible for maximum information.

Try ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated (from crane).

""TROVE"" has E, which we know is not in the word.

""GROVE"": G, R, O, V, E -> again E.

""BROTH"": B, R, O, T, H -> this seems good. Letters: B, R, O, T, H. All distinct and from the allowed set.

Is ""BROTH"" a word? Yes, meaning a liquid in which food has been simmered.

Another option: ""FROTH"": F, R, O, T, H.

Or ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L.

But ""GROWL"" has W and L, which are less common than T and H? Actually, T and H are very common.

We can also consider ""THROW"": but in ""THROW"", R is the third letter, not the second. We need R in the second position.

So, we must have the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

Therefore, ""BROTH"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""DROVE"": D, R, O, V, E -> E is eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> I is eliminated and also double D? But I is not allowed.

""DRUID"" has I, which is eliminated.

""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N -> N is eliminated.

""GROWN"": same issue.

""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D -> double O, and D is allowed. But double letters might not be ideal.

""BROOD"" is a word, but we lose information on one position.

""BROAD"": B, R, O, A, D -> A is eliminated.

So, ""BROTH"" seems solid.

Another possibility: ""TROY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> double T. But T is common, so we can test T in two positions.

However, if we use ""TROUT"", we are testing T at positions 1 and 5, O at 3, U at 4.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But ""TROUT"" has U and O, which are vowels we haven't tried much.

But ""BROTH"" has O and H, which are also good.

I think ""BROTH"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: B, O, T, H.

So, I'll go with ""BROTH"".

But let's confirm the letters: B, R, O, T, H. R is fixed at position 2. The others are new.

We are testing B at position 1, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the third guess is ""BROTH"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has the second letter **R** (confirmed in both guesses).
- The letters **C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M** are not in the word (all marked as ""x"" in previous feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess, I chose **BROTH** because:
- It keeps **R** in the second position (required).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M).
- It tests new common letters (B, O, T, H) in the remaining positions to maximize information.
- ""BROTH"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in subsequent guesses.

For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters we might try: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- We can try words like ""PRISM"", ""TRIPS"", ""DRINK"", ""GRIND"", etc.

But note: we have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

Let's think of words that have R in the second position and use other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding A, E, and also C, N). The vowels we can use are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid Y for now).

Some options:
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.
- ""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> again, C is not allowed.
- ""TRICK"": same issue.

We must avoid C. So let's avoid words with C.

Try words without C, A, N, E.

Example: ""DROPS"" -> D, R, O, P, S. This avoids the forbidden letters.

But note: we don't know if D, O, P, S are in the word. This could be a good guess.

Another option: ""GRIMY"" -> G, R, I, M, Y. This uses Y, which is less common, but acceptable.

Alternatively: ""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M. This avoids the forbidden letters.

We can also consider ""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information. Using more common letters is better.

Let's list the most common consonants: S, T, R (we already have R), L, P, M, D, etc.

And vowels: O, I, U.

We already have R fixed in position 2.

So, a good guess might be ""PRISM"" because it has P, R, I, S, M. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" has T, R, I, P, S.

But note: in ""TRIPS"", T is the first letter, R second, I third, P fourth, S fifth.

We don't know if T, I, P, S are in the word.

Similarly, ""PRISM"" has P, R, I, S, M.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones.

But we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PRISM"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. But it has two D's and U and I. Also, D is common.

But ""PRISM"" seems better because it has more common letters.

We can also consider ""SHIRT"": S, H, I, R, T. But note: R is in the second position? In ""SHIRT"", R is the fourth letter. We need R in the second position.

So, we must have a word with R as the second letter.

Therefore, ""SHIRT"" would not work because R is the fourth.

We need words of the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

So, let's stick with ""PRISM"".

But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we have 22 letters left.

We can also try ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L. This avoids the forbidden letters.

""BROIL"" is a valid word.

Another: ""GROIN"": G, R, O, I, N -> but N is forbidden! We know N is not in the word. So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""DRAIN"" has A and N, which are forbidden.

So, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

Therefore, ""BROIL"" is acceptable: B, R, O, I, L.

But ""PRISM"" is also acceptable.

I think both are good. Let's choose one that maximizes new letters.

We haven't tried P, I, S, M or B, O, I, L.

Since we have no information about the other positions, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""PRISM"" because it includes S and M, which are very common.

So, my second guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

After thinking, I decide to guess ""PRISM"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The second letter is R and is in the correct position (✓).
- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x).

The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it cannot contain C, A, N, or E.

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"" because:
- It has R as the second letter, maintaining the known correct position.
- It avoids the eliminated letters (C, A, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, S, M) to test their presence and positions.
- ""Prism"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess should provide useful feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

1. For ""crane"": 
   - C: not in word (x)
   - R: correct and in position (✓) -> so the second letter is R.
   - A: not in word (x)
   - N: not in word (x)
   - E: not in word (x)

2. For ""prism"":
   - P: not in word (x)
   - R: correct and in position (✓) -> second letter is R (already known)
   - I: not in word (x)
   - S: not in word (x)
   - M: not in word (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

The secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

And the eliminated letters are: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

We have 18 letters left in the alphabet (26 - 8 = 18) that could be in the word. The remaining letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we haven't encountered any yet. Since we don't have any indication of duplicates, we'll assume for now that we can avoid them, but we must be cautious.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to use a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Avoids the eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M.

We also want to cover as many common letters as possible to get more information.

Common letters among the remaining: T, L, O, D, H, G, B, etc.

We can try to form a word with R in the second position and using common letters.

Possible words:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> but has two T's? And T is common. However, we don't know if T is in the word. Also, O and U are vowels we haven't tried.
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> similar.
- ""DROUGHT"": too long, we need 5 letters.
- ""BROWN"": B, R, O, W, N -> but N is eliminated! We cannot use N.
- ""BROWL"": B, R, O, W, L -> this is a word? ""Browl"" is not common. Let me check: actually, ""brawl"" is a word, but that has A (eliminated). ""BROIL"" was considered earlier but now I is eliminated.

We must avoid I as well.

Let's list some words that fit:

- ""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> has double L. But we don't know if L is in the word. Also, double letters might be less informative.
- ""TROOP"": T, R, O, O, P -> but P is eliminated (from prism feedback).
- ""DROLL"": D, R, O, L, L -> again double L.

We need words without eliminated letters and without repeating letters if possible for maximum information.

Try ""TROVE"": T, R, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated (from crane).

""TROVE"" has E, which we know is not in the word.

""GROVE"": G, R, O, V, E -> again E.

""BROTH"": B, R, O, T, H -> this seems good. Letters: B, R, O, T, H. All distinct and from the allowed set.

Is ""BROTH"" a word? Yes, meaning a liquid in which food has been simmered.

Another option: ""FROTH"": F, R, O, T, H.

Or ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L.

But ""GROWL"" has W and L, which are less common than T and H? Actually, T and H are very common.

We can also consider ""THROW"": but in ""THROW"", R is the third letter, not the second. We need R in the second position.

So, we must have the form: [letter] R [letter] [letter] [letter]

Therefore, ""BROTH"" is a good candidate.

Another: ""DROVE"": D, R, O, V, E -> E is eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> I is eliminated and also double D? But I is not allowed.

""DRUID"" has I, which is eliminated.

""FROWN"": F, R, O, W, N -> N is eliminated.

""GROWN"": same issue.

""BROOD"": B, R, O, O, D -> double O, and D is allowed. But double letters might not be ideal.

""BROOD"" is a word, but we lose information on one position.

""BROAD"": B, R, O, A, D -> A is eliminated.

So, ""BROTH"" seems solid.

Another possibility: ""TROY"": only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> double T. But T is common, so we can test T in two positions.

However, if we use ""TROUT"", we are testing T at positions 1 and 5, O at 3, U at 4.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But ""TROUT"" has U and O, which are vowels we haven't tried much.

But ""BROTH"" has O and H, which are also good.

I think ""BROTH"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: B, O, T, H.

So, I'll go with ""BROTH"".

But let's confirm the letters: B, R, O, T, H. R is fixed at position 2. The others are new.

We are testing B at position 1, O at 3, T at 4, H at 5.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the third guess is ""BROTH"".

<guess>broth</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- The secret word has the second letter **R** (confirmed in both guesses).
- The letters **C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M** are not in the word (all marked as ""x"" in previous feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess, I chose **BROTH** because:
- It keeps **R** in the second position (required).
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M).
- It tests new common letters (B, O, T, H) in the remaining positions to maximize information.
- ""BROTH"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify if any of B, O, T, or H are in the word and their positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - So, R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""prism"": P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
   - R is confirmed again in the second position.
   - P, I, S, M are not in the word.

3. ""broth"": B(x), R(✓), O(x), T(-), H(x)
   - R is still in the second position.
   - B, O, H are not in the word.
   - T is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

So, from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- The second letter is R (fixed).
- T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5. But since position 4 is wrong, T is elsewhere.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M, B, O, H. That's 11 letters eliminated.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And T is in the word, so we know T is present.

But note: T is in the word, so we don't need to test for its presence, only its position. However, we must use it in a different position in the next guess.

Also, the word must contain T and R, and three other letters from the remaining set.

Now, the pattern: _ R _ _ _

We know T is not in position 4, so T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes T in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- Uses only letters from the remaining set: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, which is already included).

But note: we can use T, and the other letters must be from the remaining 13 letters (excluding the eliminated ones and including T? T is not eliminated, but we know it's in the word. We can use it again to test positions).

Actually, the available letters for new information are: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we must include T in a position that is not 4.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: then the word is T R _ _ _
- Position 3: then _ R T _ _
- Position 5: then _ R _ _ T

We need to choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new letters.

Let's consider each case and see what words are possible.

First, if T is in position 1: T R _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding eliminated ones.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word: TR...

Some options:
- TRUCK -> but C is eliminated.
- TRUCK is out. Similarly, TRACE, TRAIN, etc., have eliminated letters.
- TRUMP -> M and P eliminated.
- TRYST: T, R, Y, S, T -> S is eliminated.
- TRUSS: S eliminated.
- TRUFFLE: too long.
- TRUG: too short.
- TRULY: 5 letters? T-R-U-L-Y. But U, L, Y are available. And Y is allowed.

""TRULY"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""truly"" is 5 letters: T-R-U-L-Y.

But we have to check if U, L, Y are allowed. Yes, they are not eliminated.

But in ""TRULY"", the positions are:
- T at 1: we are testing T at position 1.
- R at 2: fixed.
- U at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

We know T is in the word, but if we put T at position 1, and if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know T is not at position 1.

Also, we test U, L, Y.

But note: in the feedback for ""broth"", T was marked as present but wrong position (at position 4). So if we put T at position 1, and if it's correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we can test other positions.

Another word: ""TRUTH"" -> T, R, U, T, H. But H is eliminated (from broth feedback). So invalid.

""TRUED"": T, R, U, E, D -> E is eliminated.

""TRUCE"": C and E eliminated.

""TRUGS"": T, R, U, G, S -> S eliminated.

""TRUMP"": M and P eliminated.

So ""TRULY"" seems a valid option: T, R, U, L, Y.

Now, if T is in position 3: _ R T _ _

We need a word of the form ? R T ? ?

With the first letter from the remaining set and last two from remaining set.

For example: 
- ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> I and E eliminated.
- ""FRITZ"": F, R, I, T, Z -> I eliminated.
- ""GRIFT"": G, R, I, F, T -> I eliminated.
- ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> I eliminated.
- ""CRWTH"": C eliminated.

It's hard to find words without eliminated letters.

""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> O and E eliminated.

""PRATE"": P and A and E? Eliminated.

Another: ""GRUNT"": G, R, U, N, T -> N eliminated.

""TRUST"": S eliminated.

""TRYST"": S eliminated.

""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> I eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B and E eliminated.

So, with T in position 3, it's difficult to find a word with the available letters.

What about ""DRYLY""? D, R, Y, L, Y -> but that has R in first? No, we need R in second.

For position 3: _ R T _ _

""ARTLY"" -> A eliminated.

""URTEX""? Not a word.

""ORTET""? Not common.

This seems problematic.

Now, if T is in position 5: _ R _ _ T

Words: ? R ? ? T

With available letters.

For example:
- ""CRAFT"": C eliminated.
- ""DRAFT"": D, R, A, F, T -> A eliminated.
- ""GRANT"": G, R, A, N, T -> A and N eliminated.
- ""FRONT"": F, R, O, N, T -> O and N eliminated.
- ""CRUST"": C and S eliminated.
- ""TRUST"": S eliminated.
- ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> E and S eliminated.
- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T -> O and S eliminated.

Again, hard.

""DRYFT""? Not a word.

""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> O eliminated.

""GRUFT""? Not a word.

""WRYLY"": W, R, Y, L, Y -> but that's W R Y L Y, so T is not at the end? We need T at the end.

""WRYLY"" has no T.

We need a word ending with T.

""LIGHT"": G, but I and H eliminated? H is eliminated (from broth).

""RIGHT"": I and H eliminated.

""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T -> I and H eliminated.

""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> O and B eliminated.

""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> M, O, N eliminated.

""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T -> C, O, N eliminated.

""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> A eliminated.

""FAULT"": F, A, U, L, T -> A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> I eliminated.

""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> B and I eliminated.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> I eliminated.

""WELDT""? Not common, and E eliminated.

""YELPT""? Not a word.

This is tough.

Perhaps we should consider that T might be in position 1 or 5, and use a word that tests T in position 1 and also introduces other letters.

Earlier ""TRULY"" seems a good candidate.

Another word for T in position 1: ""TRYKE""? Not a word.

""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> O eliminated and double L.

""TRUNK"": N and K? N eliminated.

""TRUSS"": S eliminated.

""TRUED"": E eliminated.

So ""TRULY"" is one of the few options.

We can also consider T in position 5 with a different approach.

What about ""GROUT""? But O eliminated.

""GROUT"" is out.

""FRUIT"" has I.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" but no R and E.

We need R in second position.

Perhaps ""DRYFT"" is not word, but ""DRAFT"" has A.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (but T is already in the word, so we must use it once, but we can use it in the guess to test position).

In the guess, we can use T, and we should, to find its position.

But we must avoid the eliminated letters.

So, for the word, we need:

- Position 2: R
- T must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since not in 4, and 2 is R, so only 1,3,5)
- The other three positions must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not repeating T unless necessary, but we don't know if T is repeated? But we have no indication, so assume no repeat for now).

Possible words:

1. T in position 1: T R ? ? ?
   - T R U L Y -> ""TRULY"" (U, L, Y)
   - T R U C K -> C eliminated
   - T R I P E -> I, P, E eliminated
   - T R A M P -> A, M, P eliminated
   - T R U D E -> E eliminated
   - T R U G S -> S eliminated
   - T R Y K E -> not a word
   - T R U F F -> F is allowed, but ""TRUFF"" not a word? ""Truff"" is not standard.
   - T R U M P -> M, P eliminated
   - T R Y S T -> S eliminated
   - T R I A D -> I, A eliminated
   - So only ""TRULY"" seems valid.

2. T in position 3: ? R T ? ?
   - D R T ? ? -> hard, e.g., ""DRT"" not common start.
   - ""DIRTY"" -> I eliminated
   - ""DARTY"" -> A eliminated
   - ""DORTY"" -> O eliminated, and not common
   - ""F R T ? ?"" -> ""FRT"" not common
   - ""G R T ? ?"" -> ""GRT"" not common
   - ""W R T ? ?"" -> ""WRYTH""? Not a word. ""WRATH"" -> A eliminated.
   - ""U R T E X"" -> not 5 letters? ""URTEX"" not a word.
   - ""Q R T ? ?"" -> no common words.
   - ""L R T ? ?"" -> ""LRT"" not common.
   - So no common words with T in position 3.

3. T in position 5: ? R ? ? T
   - ? R ? ? T
   - ""D R ? ? T"" -> ""DRAFT"" A eliminated, ""DRIFT"" I eliminated, ""DROIT"" O eliminated, ""DRUNT"" N eliminated, ""DRYFT"" not word.
   - ""F R ? ? T"" -> ""FRUIT"" I eliminated, ""FROST"" O and S eliminated, ""FREET"" E eliminated.
   - ""G R ? ? T"" -> ""GRANT"" A and N, ""GROUT"" O, ""GRIOT"" I, ""GREET"" E.
   - ""J R ? ? T"" -> no common words.
   - ""K R ? ? T"" -> ""KRAFT"" A? ""Krait"" is a word, but K R A I T -> A and I eliminated.
   - ""L R ? ? T"" -> ""LURET""? Not word. ""LYART""? Not common.
   - ""Q R ? ? T"" -> no.
   - ""U R ? ? T"" -> ""URBAT""? No.
   - ""V R ? ? T"" -> ""V R I T ?"" not, ""VROST""? No.
   - ""W R ? ? T"" -> ""WREST"" E and S, ""WROOT"" O, ""WRYTH"" not word.
   - ""X R ? ? T"" -> no.
   - ""Y R ? ? T"" -> ""YRAST""? Not common.
   - ""Z R ? ? T"" -> no.

So, the only common word I can find is ""TRULY"" with T in position 1.

Therefore, we should guess ""TRULY"".

In ""TRULY"", we have:
- T at position 1: if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, but T is in the word, it might be marked as ""-"" if it's present but wrong position (which would mean T is at position 3 or 5).
- We also test U at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

This should give us good information.

So, let's go with ""TRULY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Secret Word Pattern**: The second letter is confirmed as **R** (from all guesses). The word structure is: _ R _ _ _
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M, B, O, H (from feedback: all marked ""x"").
- **Present Letters (in the word but position unknown)**: T (marked ""-"" in Guess 3, so it is in the word but not in position 4).
- **Possible Positions for T**: Since T is not in position 4 and position 2 is R, T must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Remaining Letters Available**: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (T is already in the word but must be tested in a new position).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on T's Position**: Test T in position 1 (since positions 3 and 5 are harder to form valid words with remaining letters).
- **Maximize Information**: Use new, common letters from the remaining set (U, L, Y) to cover more ground.
- **Valid Word Constraint**: The guess must be a 5-letter English word with R in position 2, avoiding eliminated letters.

### Chosen Guess: ""TRULY""
- **Why ""TRULY""?**
  - Tests T in position 1 (if correct, it confirms T's position; if not, T must be in position 3 or 5).
  - Introduces new letters U (position 3), L (position 4), and Y (position 5), which are common and not yet tested.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M, B, O, H).
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning ""in a truthful way"").
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - If T is in position 1, feedback will show ✓ for T.
  - If T is not in position 1 but is in the word, feedback will show T as ""-"" (wrong position), narrowing T to position 3 or 5.
  - Feedback on U, L, and Y will further eliminate or confirm their presence/positions.

<guess>truly</guess>",truly,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - So, R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""prism"": P(x), R(✓), I(x), S(x), M(x)
   - R is confirmed again in the second position.
   - P, I, S, M are not in the word.

3. ""broth"": B(x), R(✓), O(x), T(-), H(x)
   - R is still in the second position.
   - B, O, H are not in the word.
   - T is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position).

So, from all feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- The second letter is R (fixed).
- T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So T must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5. But since position 4 is wrong, T is elsewhere.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, E, P, I, S, M, B, O, H. That's 11 letters eliminated.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And T is in the word, so we know T is present.

But note: T is in the word, so we don't need to test for its presence, only its position. However, we must use it in a different position in the next guess.

Also, the word must contain T and R, and three other letters from the remaining set.

Now, the pattern: _ R _ _ _

We know T is not in position 4, so T can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

We need to form a word that:
- Has R in position 2.
- Includes T in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- Uses only letters from the remaining set: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and T, which is already included).

But note: we can use T, and the other letters must be from the remaining 13 letters (excluding the eliminated ones and including T? T is not eliminated, but we know it's in the word. We can use it again to test positions).

Actually, the available letters for new information are: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And we must include T in a position that is not 4.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: then the word is T R _ _ _
- Position 3: then _ R T _ _
- Position 5: then _ R _ _ T

We need to choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new letters.

Let's consider each case and see what words are possible.

First, if T is in position 1: T R _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from the remaining set, avoiding eliminated ones.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word: TR...

Some options:
- TRUCK -> but C is eliminated.
- TRUCK is out. Similarly, TRACE, TRAIN, etc., have eliminated letters.
- TRUMP -> M and P eliminated.
- TRYST: T, R, Y, S, T -> S is eliminated.
- TRUSS: S eliminated.
- TRUFFLE: too long.
- TRUG: too short.
- TRULY: 5 letters? T-R-U-L-Y. But U, L, Y are available. And Y is allowed.

""TRULY"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""truly"" is 5 letters: T-R-U-L-Y.

But we have to check if U, L, Y are allowed. Yes, they are not eliminated.

But in ""TRULY"", the positions are:
- T at 1: we are testing T at position 1.
- R at 2: fixed.
- U at 3
- L at 4
- Y at 5

We know T is in the word, but if we put T at position 1, and if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know T is not at position 1.

Also, we test U, L, Y.

But note: in the feedback for ""broth"", T was marked as present but wrong position (at position 4). So if we put T at position 1, and if it's correct, then good. If not, then T must be at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we can test other positions.

Another word: ""TRUTH"" -> T, R, U, T, H. But H is eliminated (from broth feedback). So invalid.

""TRUED"": T, R, U, E, D -> E is eliminated.

""TRUCE"": C and E eliminated.

""TRUGS"": T, R, U, G, S -> S eliminated.

""TRUMP"": M and P eliminated.

So ""TRULY"" seems a valid option: T, R, U, L, Y.

Now, if T is in position 3: _ R T _ _

We need a word of the form ? R T ? ?

With the first letter from the remaining set and last two from remaining set.

For example: 
- ""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> I and E eliminated.
- ""FRITZ"": F, R, I, T, Z -> I eliminated.
- ""GRIFT"": G, R, I, F, T -> I eliminated.
- ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> I eliminated.
- ""CRWTH"": C eliminated.

It's hard to find words without eliminated letters.

""WROTE"": W, R, O, T, E -> O and E eliminated.

""PRATE"": P and A and E? Eliminated.

Another: ""GRUNT"": G, R, U, N, T -> N eliminated.

""TRUST"": S eliminated.

""TRYST"": S eliminated.

""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> I eliminated.

""BRUTE"": B and E eliminated.

So, with T in position 3, it's difficult to find a word with the available letters.

What about ""DRYLY""? D, R, Y, L, Y -> but that has R in first? No, we need R in second.

For position 3: _ R T _ _

""ARTLY"" -> A eliminated.

""URTEX""? Not a word.

""ORTET""? Not common.

This seems problematic.

Now, if T is in position 5: _ R _ _ T

Words: ? R ? ? T

With available letters.

For example:
- ""CRAFT"": C eliminated.
- ""DRAFT"": D, R, A, F, T -> A eliminated.
- ""GRANT"": G, R, A, N, T -> A and N eliminated.
- ""FRONT"": F, R, O, N, T -> O and N eliminated.
- ""CRUST"": C and S eliminated.
- ""TRUST"": S eliminated.
- ""WREST"": W, R, E, S, T -> E and S eliminated.
- ""FROST"": F, R, O, S, T -> O and S eliminated.

Again, hard.

""DRYFT""? Not a word.

""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> O eliminated.

""GRUFT""? Not a word.

""WRYLY"": W, R, Y, L, Y -> but that's W R Y L Y, so T is not at the end? We need T at the end.

""WRYLY"" has no T.

We need a word ending with T.

""LIGHT"": G, but I and H eliminated? H is eliminated (from broth).

""RIGHT"": I and H eliminated.

""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T -> I and H eliminated.

""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> O and B eliminated.

""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> M, O, N eliminated.

""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T -> C, O, N eliminated.

""VAULT"": V, A, U, L, T -> A eliminated.

""FAULT"": F, A, U, L, T -> A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> I eliminated.

""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> B and I eliminated.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> I eliminated.

""WELDT""? Not common, and E eliminated.

""YELPT""? Not a word.

This is tough.

Perhaps we should consider that T might be in position 1 or 5, and use a word that tests T in position 1 and also introduces other letters.

Earlier ""TRULY"" seems a good candidate.

Another word for T in position 1: ""TRYKE""? Not a word.

""TROLL"": T, R, O, L, L -> O eliminated and double L.

""TRUNK"": N and K? N eliminated.

""TRUSS"": S eliminated.

""TRUED"": E eliminated.

So ""TRULY"" is one of the few options.

We can also consider T in position 5 with a different approach.

What about ""GROUT""? But O eliminated.

""GROUT"" is out.

""FRUIT"" has I.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" but no R and E.

We need R in second position.

Perhaps ""DRYFT"" is not word, but ""DRAFT"" has A.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and T (but T is already in the word, so we must use it once, but we can use it in the guess to test position).

In the guess, we can use T, and we should, to find its position.

But we must avoid the eliminated letters.

So, for the word, we need:

- Position 2: R
- T must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (since not in 4, and 2 is R, so only 1,3,5)
- The other three positions must be filled with letters from: D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not repeating T unless necessary, but we don't know if T is repeated? But we have no indication, so assume no repeat for now).

Possible words:

1. T in position 1: T R ? ? ?
   - T R U L Y -> ""TRULY"" (U, L, Y)
   - T R U C K -> C eliminated
   - T R I P E -> I, P, E eliminated
   - T R A M P -> A, M, P eliminated
   - T R U D E -> E eliminated
   - T R U G S -> S eliminated
   - T R Y K E -> not a word
   - T R U F F -> F is allowed, but ""TRUFF"" not a word? ""Truff"" is not standard.
   - T R U M P -> M, P eliminated
   - T R Y S T -> S eliminated
   - T R I A D -> I, A eliminated
   - So only ""TRULY"" seems valid.

2. T in position 3: ? R T ? ?
   - D R T ? ? -> hard, e.g., ""DRT"" not common start.
   - ""DIRTY"" -> I eliminated
   - ""DARTY"" -> A eliminated
   - ""DORTY"" -> O eliminated, and not common
   - ""F R T ? ?"" -> ""FRT"" not common
   - ""G R T ? ?"" -> ""GRT"" not common
   - ""W R T ? ?"" -> ""WRYTH""? Not a word. ""WRATH"" -> A eliminated.
   - ""U R T E X"" -> not 5 letters? ""URTEX"" not a word.
   - ""Q R T ? ?"" -> no common words.
   - ""L R T ? ?"" -> ""LRT"" not common.
   - So no common words with T in position 3.

3. T in position 5: ? R ? ? T
   - ? R ? ? T
   - ""D R ? ? T"" -> ""DRAFT"" A eliminated, ""DRIFT"" I eliminated, ""DROIT"" O eliminated, ""DRUNT"" N eliminated, ""DRYFT"" not word.
   - ""F R ? ? T"" -> ""FRUIT"" I eliminated, ""FROST"" O and S eliminated, ""FREET"" E eliminated.
   - ""G R ? ? T"" -> ""GRANT"" A and N, ""GROUT"" O, ""GRIOT"" I, ""GREET"" E.
   - ""J R ? ? T"" -> no common words.
   - ""K R ? ? T"" -> ""KRAFT"" A? ""Krait"" is a word, but K R A I T -> A and I eliminated.
   - ""L R ? ? T"" -> ""LURET""? Not word. ""LYART""? Not common.
   - ""Q R ? ? T"" -> no.
   - ""U R ? ? T"" -> ""URBAT""? No.
   - ""V R ? ? T"" -> ""V R I T ?"" not, ""VROST""? No.
   - ""W R ? ? T"" -> ""WREST"" E and S, ""WROOT"" O, ""WRYTH"" not word.
   - ""X R ? ? T"" -> no.
   - ""Y R ? ? T"" -> ""YRAST""? Not common.
   - ""Z R ? ? T"" -> no.

So, the only common word I can find is ""TRULY"" with T in position 1.

Therefore, we should guess ""TRULY"".

In ""TRULY"", we have:
- T at position 1: if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, but T is in the word, it might be marked as ""-"" if it's present but wrong position (which would mean T is at position 3 or 5).
- We also test U at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

This should give us good information.

So, let's go with ""TRULY"".
