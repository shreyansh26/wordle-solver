We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).
   - Contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.

 Since the word must have an E, and we don't know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).

 Example words:
   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven't tested T, I, M, S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don't know about other letters.

 However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.

 Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn't say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don't know the position. However, we know it's not in the 5th.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:

   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T's? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don't know.

   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.

   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.

   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.

 Some options:

   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.

   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That's okay.

   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.

   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E's? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple. But we can try.

   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don't know.

   But we are allowed to use multiple E's? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.

   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.

   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.

   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.

   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.

   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.

   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.

   But we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it's okay.

   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.

   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: 
        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That's acceptable.

   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.

   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

   Let me compare:

   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.

   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.

   Both are good.

   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E's? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But we are allowed to use two E's? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

   We'll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.

   Format: <guess>times</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.

For the second guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.

""TIMES"" fits these criteria:
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).
- No C, R, A, N.

 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

   We'll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.

   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.

For the second guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.

""TIMES"" fits these criteria:
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).
- No C, R, A, N.",Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,jelly,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's choose a word with common consonants and vowels. One common starting word is ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback. But since this is the first guess, we just need to pick one.

 Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).
   - Contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.

 Since the word must have an E, and we don't know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).

 Example words:
   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven't tested T, I, M, S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don't know about other letters.

 However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.

 Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn't say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don't know the position. However, we know it's not in the 5th.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:

   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T's? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don't know.

   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.

   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.

   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.

 Some options:

   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.

   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That's okay.

   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.

   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E's? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple. But we can try.

   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don't know.

   But we are allowed to use multiple E's? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.

   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.

   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.

   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.

   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.

   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.

   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.

   But we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it's okay.

   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.

   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: 
        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That's acceptable.

   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.

   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

   Let me compare:

   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.

   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.

   Both are good.

   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E's? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But we are allowed to use two E's? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

This is a good way to test.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.\n\n   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.\n\n   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.\n\n   But we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it\'s okay.\n\n   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: \n        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.\n\n   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.\n\n   Both are good.\n\n   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E\'s? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are allowed to use two E\'s? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E\'s, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E\'s, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one \'-\' for the correct one and an \'x\' for the 5th? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.\n\n   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.\n\n   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid R.\n\n   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.\n\n   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.\n\n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). \n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.\n\n   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.\n\n   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.\n\n   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it\'s still common.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\n   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.\n\n   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.\n\n   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?\n\n   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.\n   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.\n\n   We have 4 new letters in each.\n\n   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).\n   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).\n\n   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.\n\n   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s in another position.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""TIMES"".\n\n   Guess: ""TIMES""\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).\n- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.\n\n""TIMES"" fits these criteria:\n- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).\n- No C, R, A, N.\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)
Meaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").

So we know:
- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.
2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
3. Tries to test new common letters.

Available letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _

We need to form valid words.

Since E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.

Let's brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. 
- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.

We must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.

Another word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E's, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.

How about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.

So discard.

Another: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That's acceptable.

But we don't know about X? That's a rare letter. We might get less information.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.
- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.

How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.

""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don't have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L's? That's acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn't forbid duplicates.

However, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.
- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.

""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.

How about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won't be correct. We can put it but we know it will be '-' if it's not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.

In this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.

Let's find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.

""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.

""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.

So it's getting hard.

Back to E in position 1 or 2.

Earlier, we had two candidates:
- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)

Also other possibilities?

How about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.

""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.

""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give '-' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be 'check'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave '-' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.

Therefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won't be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get '-' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.

In ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E's? But the secret word has only one E? We don't know. It might have two E's.

Alternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.

Let me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.

So for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.

Another word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.

""ELBOW"" is a valid word.

Similarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.

""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.

""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.

But we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.

Another: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.

So back to:
Option E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)
Option E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)
Option E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
Option E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So ""EBONY"" is invalid.

Another E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let's assume we stick to common words.

So candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""

Now compare:
- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.
- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.
- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.

We want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

The most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.

Therefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L's? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L's? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.

""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.

""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).

So for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.

But E position is different.

We know E must be present, but we don't know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get '-' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If '-', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.

But we are also covering other letters.

I think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.

Let me confirm if there are better words.

Another possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.

""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.

""AXLED""?: Not common.

""UGLED""? Not common.

So sticking with E at 1 or 2.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.

Therefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".

Guess: ""ELBOW""

In this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.

We'll get feedback on each.

So response format:

<guess>elbow</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).

Key insights:
- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Strategy:
- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.
- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.
- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.

Selected guess: ""ELBOW""
- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.
- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.
- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.

<guess>elbow</guess>",elbow,"We have two guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)
Meaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").

So we know:
- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.
2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
3. Tries to test new common letters.

Available letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _

We need to form valid words.

Since E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.

Let's brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. 
- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.

We must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.

Another word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E's, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.

How about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.

So discard.

Another: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That's acceptable.

But we don't know about X? That's a rare letter. We might get less information.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.
- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.

How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.

""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don't have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L's? That's acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn't forbid duplicates.

However, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.
- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.

""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.

How about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won't be correct. We can put it but we know it will be '-' if it's not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.

In this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.

Let's find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.

""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.

""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.

So it's getting hard.

Back to E in position 1 or 2.

Earlier, we had two candidates:
- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)

Also other possibilities?

How about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.

""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.

""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give '-' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be 'check'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave '-' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.

Therefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won't be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get '-' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.

In ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E's? But the secret word has only one E? We don't know. It might have two E's.

Alternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.

Let me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.

So for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.

Another word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.

""ELBOW"" is a valid word.

Similarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.

""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.

""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.

But we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.

Another: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.

So back to:
Option E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)
Option E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)
Option E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
Option E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So ""EBONY"" is invalid.

Another E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let's assume we stick to common words.

So candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""

Now compare:
- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.
- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.
- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.

We want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

The most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.

Therefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L's? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L's? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.

""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.

""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).

So for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.

But E position is different.

We know E must be present, but we don't know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get '-' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If '-', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.

But we are also covering other letters.

I think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.

Let me confirm if there are better words.

Another possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.

""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.

""AXLED""?: Not common.

""UGLED""? Not common.

So sticking with E at 1 or 2.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.

Therefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".

Guess: ""ELBOW""

In this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.

We'll get feedback on each.

So response format:

<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).

Key insights:
- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Strategy:
- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.
- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.
- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.

Selected guess: ""ELBOW""
- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.
- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.
- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.",Guess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's choose a word with common consonants and vowels. One common starting word is ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback. But since this is the first guess, we just need to pick one.

 Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).
   - Contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.

 Since the word must have an E, and we don't know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).

 Example words:
   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven't tested T, I, M, S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don't know about other letters.

 However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.

 Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn't say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don't know the position. However, we know it's not in the 5th.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:

   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T's? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don't know.

   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.

   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.

   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.

 Some options:

   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.

   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That's okay.

   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.

   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E's? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple. But we can try.

   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don't know.

   But we are allowed to use multiple E's? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.

   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.

   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.

   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.

   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.

   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.

   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.

   But we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it's okay.

   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.

   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: 
        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That's acceptable.

   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.

   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

   Let me compare:

   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.

   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.

   Both are good.

   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E's? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But we are allowed to use two E's? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

   We'll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.

   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.

For the second guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.

""TIMES"" fits these criteria:
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).
- No C, R, A, N.

<guess>times</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)
Meaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").

So we know:
- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.
2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
3. Tries to test new common letters.

Available letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _

We need to form valid words.

Since E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.

Let's brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. 
- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.

We must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.

Another word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E's, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.

How about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.

So discard.

Another: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That's acceptable.

But we don't know about X? That's a rare letter. We might get less information.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.
- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.

How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.

""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don't have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L's? That's acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn't forbid duplicates.

However, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.
- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.

""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.

How about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won't be correct. We can put it but we know it will be '-' if it's not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.

In this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.

Let's find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.

""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.

""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.

So it's getting hard.

Back to E in position 1 or 2.

Earlier, we had two candidates:
- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)

Also other possibilities?

How about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.

""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.

""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give '-' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be 'check'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave '-' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.

Therefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won't be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get '-' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.

In ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E's? But the secret word has only one E? We don't know. It might have two E's.

Alternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.

Let me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.

So for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.

Another word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.

""ELBOW"" is a valid word.

Similarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.

""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.

""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.

But we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.

Another: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.

So back to:
Option E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)
Option E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)
Option E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
Option E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So ""EBONY"" is invalid.

Another E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let's assume we stick to common words.

So candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""

Now compare:
- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.
- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.
- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.

We want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

The most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.

Therefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L's? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L's? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.

""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.

""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).

So for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.

But E position is different.

We know E must be present, but we don't know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get '-' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If '-', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.

But we are also covering other letters.

I think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.

Let me confirm if there are better words.

Another possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.

""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.

""AXLED""?: Not common.

""UGLED""? Not common.

So sticking with E at 1 or 2.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.

Therefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".

Guess: ""ELBOW""

In this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.

We'll get feedback on each.

So response format:

<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).

Key insights:
- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Strategy:
- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.
- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.
- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.

Selected guess: ""ELBOW""
- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.
- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.
- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.

Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.\n\n We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since the word must have an E, and we don\'t know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.\n\n We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).\n\n Example words:\n   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven\'t tested T, I, M, S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don\'t know about other letters.\n\n However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.\n\n But let\'s consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.\n\n Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn\'t say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don\'t know the position. However, we know it\'s not in the 5th.\n\n Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:\n\n   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T\'s? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\n   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don\'t know.\n\n   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.\n\n   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.\n\n   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.\n\n Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.\n\n Some options:\n\n   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That\'s okay.\n\n   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.\n\n   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E\'s? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple. But we can try.\n\n   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\n   But we are allowed to use multiple E\'s? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.\n\n   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.\n\n   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.\n\n   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.\n\n   But we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it\'s okay.\n\n   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: \n        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.\n\n   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.\n\n   Both are good.\n\n   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E\'s? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are allowed to use two E\'s? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E\'s, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E\'s, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one \'-\' for the correct one and an \'x\' for the 5th? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.\n\n   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.\n\n   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid R.\n\n   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.\n\n   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.\n\n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). \n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.\n\n   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.\n\n   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.\n\n   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it\'s still common.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\n   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.\n\n   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.\n\n   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?\n\n   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.\n   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.\n\n   We have 4 new letters in each.\n\n   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).\n   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).\n\n   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.\n\n   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s in another position.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""TIMES"".\n\n   Guess: ""TIMES""\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).\n- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.\n\n""TIMES"" fits these criteria:\n- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).\n- No C, R, A, N.\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.\n2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n3. Tries to test new common letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven\'t tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ E _ _\n\nWe need to form valid words.\n\nSince E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.\n\nOption 1: E in position 1\n- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. \n- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.\n\nWe must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.\n\nAnother word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E\'s, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.\n\nHow about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.\n\nSo discard.\n\nAnother: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we don\'t know about X? That\'s a rare letter. We might get less information.\n\nOption 2: E in position 2\n- Pattern: _ E _ _ _\n- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.\n- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.\n\nHow about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don\'t have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L\'s? That\'s acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid duplicates.\n\nHowever, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.\n\nOption 3: E in position 3\n- Pattern: _ _ E _ _\n- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.\n\nHow about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won\'t be correct. We can put it but we know it will be \'-\' if it\'s not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.\n\nIn this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.\n\nLet\'s find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.\n\n""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.\n\n""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo it\'s getting hard.\n\nBack to E in position 1 or 2.\n\nEarlier, we had two candidates:\n- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\n- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\n\nAlso other possibilities?\n\nHow about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.\n\n""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give \'-\' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be \'check\'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave \'-\' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won\'t be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get \'-\' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.\n\nIn ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E\'s? But the secret word has only one E? We don\'t know. It might have two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.\n\nLet me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.\n\nSo for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.\n\nAnother word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.\n\n""ELBOW"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.\n\nBut we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.\n\nAnother: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo back to:\nOption E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)\nOption E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\nOption E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\nOption E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo ""EBONY"" is invalid.\n\nAnother E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let\'s assume we stick to common words.\n\nSo candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""\n\nNow compare:\n- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.\n- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.\n- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.\n\nWe want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nThe most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nTherefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L\'s? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L\'s? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.\n\n""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.\n\n""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).\n\nSo for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.\n\nBut E position is different.\n\nWe know E must be present, but we don\'t know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get \'-\' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If \'-\', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.\n\nBut we are also covering other letters.\n\nI think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.\n\nLet me confirm if there are better words.\n\nAnother possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.\n\n""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.\n\n""AXLED""?: Not common.\n\n""UGLED""? Not common.\n\nSo sticking with E at 1 or 2.\n\nAnother word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".\n\nGuess: ""ELBOW""\n\nIn this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each.\n\nSo response format:\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).\n- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.\n\nStrategy:\n- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.\n- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.\n- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.\n\nSelected guess: ""ELBOW""\n- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.\n- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.\n- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
We've had three guesses so far:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
- Meaning: E is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got '-'). T, I, M, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
- Meaning: 
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got '-')
  - B, O, W are not in the word.

So from all the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. 
That is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

Present letters (but position unknown): E and L.

We know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got '-', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: We don't have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.

Also, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.

We have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).

We need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:

- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can't be at 1,4,5).
- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.

We also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.

We need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we'll get '-' again? That wouldn't help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient. So let's put L in a position we haven't tried.

Similarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?

But we don't know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.

Let's consider:

- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.

- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.

We have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.

So let's try to form a word that:

- Has E at position 2 or 3.
- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).

However, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Also, we must have a valid word.

Now, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don't know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.

Let me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.

First, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _

We need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:

Position 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).
Position 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.

Example words:

- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven't tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.

So ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.

- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ 
  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? 

But we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.

What words? For example:
  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? 

""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don't know how many E's? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.

But for this pattern: _ E _ L _

  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.

  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.

It's hard.

E at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L

Words: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.

""VEXEL"" Not a common word.

Alternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _

Then we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.

So L must be at 1,4,5.

Example: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ 

Words? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.

""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.

""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.

Or L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven't tested them? But also, two L's? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? 

But E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?

""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L

Words: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.

""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.

So one possibility: ""QUELL""

But let's see:

Pattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.

So letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L's? That's fine.

But note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don't know.

Also, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.

Is ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".

But Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.

Another option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.

E at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don't know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.

Similarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.

But E cannot be in the end.

Therefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _

But then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.

Another word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.

""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.

So maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.

So ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don't have many choices.

Another word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: 
  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? 
  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.
  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.

How about without L? But we have to include L because it's present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don't include L, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don't require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don't have to?

In the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a '-' for L? No? Because if we don't put any L, then we don't get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn't guess it, we won't know.

However, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.

Thus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.

Therefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L's? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:

- Position 1: Q -> new
- Position 2: U -> new
- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? 
- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? 

Then we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a '-' for each? Or one might be correct? We don't know.

But we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _

But then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _

But then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.

Words: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.

""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.

""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.

But we have double G? That's fine.

But position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.

Is ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.

Similarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.

So ""LEGGY"" is possible?

But we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.

""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.

With E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _

Words: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.

""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.

""KELEP"" -> not common.

""HELIM"" not? 

So difficult.

Therefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""

Let's compare:

""QUELL"": 
   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get '-' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get '-' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.

Similarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L's? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it's at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get '-' for both? We also test Q and U.

""LEGGY"": 
   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can't be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or '-' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?

In ""LEGGY"": 
   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? 
   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?
   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.
   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.

So both guesses are viable.

But let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.

Additionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.

Therefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?

But also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G's? But that's fine.

But we can also consider: we haven't used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.

Another word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.

So we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.

Therefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".

Let me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).

Then feedback will tell us:

- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.

- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don't have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? 

We are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a '-', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives '-' then L must be at position 3? Etc.

But it's fine.

I think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.

So guess: ""LEGGY""

But let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.

Therefore, we return ""LEGGY"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.
- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.
- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.

The new guess must:
1. Include both E and L (known present letters).
2. Place E in position 2 or 3.
3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn't conflict with E).
4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
5. Form a valid English word.

Given E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:
- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).
- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).
- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).
- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).
- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.

Using ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:
- Determines E's position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it's confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.
- Tests L in position 1.
- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.

<guess>leggy</guess>",leggy,"We've had three guesses so far:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
- Meaning: E is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got '-'). T, I, M, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
- Meaning: 
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got '-')
  - B, O, W are not in the word.

So from all the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. 
That is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

Present letters (but position unknown): E and L.

We know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got '-', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: We don't have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.

Also, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.

We have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).

We need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:

- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can't be at 1,4,5).
- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.

We also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.

We need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we'll get '-' again? That wouldn't help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient. So let's put L in a position we haven't tried.

Similarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?

But we don't know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.

Let's consider:

- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.

- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.

We have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.

So let's try to form a word that:

- Has E at position 2 or 3.
- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).

However, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Also, we must have a valid word.

Now, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don't know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.

Let me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.

First, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _

We need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:

Position 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).
Position 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.

Example words:

- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven't tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.

So ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.

- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ 
  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? 

But we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.

What words? For example:
  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? 

""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don't know how many E's? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.

But for this pattern: _ E _ L _

  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.

  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.

It's hard.

E at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L

Words: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.

""VEXEL"" Not a common word.

Alternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _

Then we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.

So L must be at 1,4,5.

Example: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ 

Words? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.

""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.

""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.

Or L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven't tested them? But also, two L's? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? 

But E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?

""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L

Words: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.

""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.

So one possibility: ""QUELL""

But let's see:

Pattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.

So letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L's? That's fine.

But note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don't know.

Also, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.

Is ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".

But Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.

Another option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.

E at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don't know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.

Similarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.

But E cannot be in the end.

Therefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _

But then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.

Another word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.

""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.

So maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.

So ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don't have many choices.

Another word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: 
  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? 
  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.
  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.

How about without L? But we have to include L because it's present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don't include L, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don't require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don't have to?

In the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a '-' for L? No? Because if we don't put any L, then we don't get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn't guess it, we won't know.

However, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.

Thus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.

Therefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L's? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:

- Position 1: Q -> new
- Position 2: U -> new
- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? 
- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? 

Then we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a '-' for each? Or one might be correct? We don't know.

But we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _

But then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _

But then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.

Words: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.

""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.

""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.

But we have double G? That's fine.

But position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.

Is ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.

Similarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.

So ""LEGGY"" is possible?

But we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.

""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.

With E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _

Words: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.

""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.

""KELEP"" -> not common.

""HELIM"" not? 

So difficult.

Therefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""

Let's compare:

""QUELL"": 
   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get '-' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get '-' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.

Similarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L's? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it's at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get '-' for both? We also test Q and U.

""LEGGY"": 
   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can't be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or '-' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?

In ""LEGGY"": 
   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? 
   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?
   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.
   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.

So both guesses are viable.

But let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.

Additionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.

Therefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?

But also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G's? But that's fine.

But we can also consider: we haven't used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.

Another word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.

So we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.

Therefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".

Let me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).

Then feedback will tell us:

- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.

- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don't have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? 

We are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a '-', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives '-' then L must be at position 3? Etc.

But it's fine.

I think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.

So guess: ""LEGGY""

But let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.

Therefore, we return ""LEGGY"".After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.
- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.
- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.

The new guess must:
1. Include both E and L (known present letters).
2. Place E in position 2 or 3.
3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn't conflict with E).
4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
5. Form a valid English word.

Given E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:
- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).
- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).
- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).
- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).
- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.

Using ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:
- Determines E's position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it's confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.
- Tests L in position 1.
- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.",Guess 4: leggy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,jelly,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's choose a word with common consonants and vowels. One common starting word is ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback. But since this is the first guess, we just need to pick one.

 Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).
   - Contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.

 Since the word must have an E, and we don't know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).

 Example words:
   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven't tested T, I, M, S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don't know about other letters.

 However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.

 Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn't say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don't know the position. However, we know it's not in the 5th.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:

   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T's? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don't know.

   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.

   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.

   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.

 Some options:

   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.

   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That's okay.

   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.

   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E's? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple. But we can try.

   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don't know.

   But we are allowed to use multiple E's? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.

   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.

   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.

   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.

   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.

   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.

   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.

   But we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it's okay.

   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.

   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: 
        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That's acceptable.

   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.

   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

   Let me compare:

   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.

   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.

   Both are good.

   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E's? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But we are allowed to use two E's? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

   We'll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.

   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.

For the second guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.

""TIMES"" fits these criteria:
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).
- No C, R, A, N.

<guess>times</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)
Meaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").

So we know:
- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.
2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
3. Tries to test new common letters.

Available letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _

We need to form valid words.

Since E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.

Let's brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. 
- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.

We must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.

Another word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E's, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.

How about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.

So discard.

Another: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That's acceptable.

But we don't know about X? That's a rare letter. We might get less information.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.
- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.

How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.

""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don't have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L's? That's acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn't forbid duplicates.

However, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.
- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.

""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.

How about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won't be correct. We can put it but we know it will be '-' if it's not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.

In this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.

Let's find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.

""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.

""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.

So it's getting hard.

Back to E in position 1 or 2.

Earlier, we had two candidates:
- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)

Also other possibilities?

How about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.

""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.

""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give '-' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be 'check'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave '-' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.

Therefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won't be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get '-' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.

In ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E's? But the secret word has only one E? We don't know. It might have two E's.

Alternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.

Let me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.

So for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.

Another word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.

""ELBOW"" is a valid word.

Similarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.

""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.

""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.

But we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.

Another: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.

So back to:
Option E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)
Option E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)
Option E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
Option E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So ""EBONY"" is invalid.

Another E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let's assume we stick to common words.

So candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""

Now compare:
- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.
- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.
- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.

We want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

The most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.

Therefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L's? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L's? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.

""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.

""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).

So for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.

But E position is different.

We know E must be present, but we don't know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get '-' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If '-', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.

But we are also covering other letters.

I think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.

Let me confirm if there are better words.

Another possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.

""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.

""AXLED""?: Not common.

""UGLED""? Not common.

So sticking with E at 1 or 2.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.

Therefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".

Guess: ""ELBOW""

In this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.

We'll get feedback on each.

So response format:

<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).

Key insights:
- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Strategy:
- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.
- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.
- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.

Selected guess: ""ELBOW""
- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.
- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.
- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.

<guess>elbow</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Guess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We've had three guesses so far:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
- Meaning: E is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got '-'). T, I, M, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
- Meaning: 
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got '-')
  - B, O, W are not in the word.

So from all the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. 
That is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

Present letters (but position unknown): E and L.

We know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got '-', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: We don't have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.

Also, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.

We have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).

We need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:

- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can't be at 1,4,5).
- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.

We also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.

We need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we'll get '-' again? That wouldn't help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient. So let's put L in a position we haven't tried.

Similarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?

But we don't know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.

Let's consider:

- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.

- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.

We have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.

So let's try to form a word that:

- Has E at position 2 or 3.
- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).

However, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Also, we must have a valid word.

Now, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don't know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.

Let me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.

First, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _

We need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:

Position 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).
Position 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.

Example words:

- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven't tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.

So ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.

- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ 
  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? 

But we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.

What words? For example:
  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? 

""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don't know how many E's? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.

But for this pattern: _ E _ L _

  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.

  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.

It's hard.

E at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L

Words: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.

""VEXEL"" Not a common word.

Alternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _

Then we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.

So L must be at 1,4,5.

Example: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ 

Words? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.

""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.

""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.

Or L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven't tested them? But also, two L's? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? 

But E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?

""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L

Words: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.

""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.

So one possibility: ""QUELL""

But let's see:

Pattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.

So letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L's? That's fine.

But note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don't know.

Also, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.

Is ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".

But Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.

Another option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.

E at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don't know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.

Similarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.

But E cannot be in the end.

Therefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _

But then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.

Another word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.

""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.

So maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.

So ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don't have many choices.

Another word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: 
  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? 
  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.
  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.

How about without L? But we have to include L because it's present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don't include L, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don't require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don't have to?

In the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a '-' for L? No? Because if we don't put any L, then we don't get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn't guess it, we won't know.

However, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.

Thus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.

Therefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L's? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:

- Position 1: Q -> new
- Position 2: U -> new
- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? 
- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? 

Then we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a '-' for each? Or one might be correct? We don't know.

But we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _

But then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _

But then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.

Words: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.

""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.

""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.

But we have double G? That's fine.

But position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.

Is ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.

Similarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.

So ""LEGGY"" is possible?

But we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.

""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.

With E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _

Words: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.

""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.

""KELEP"" -> not common.

""HELIM"" not? 

So difficult.

Therefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""

Let's compare:

""QUELL"": 
   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get '-' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get '-' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.

Similarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L's? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it's at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get '-' for both? We also test Q and U.

""LEGGY"": 
   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can't be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or '-' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?

In ""LEGGY"": 
   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? 
   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?
   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.
   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.

So both guesses are viable.

But let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.

Additionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.

Therefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?

But also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G's? But that's fine.

But we can also consider: we haven't used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.

Another word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.

So we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.

Therefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".

Let me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).

Then feedback will tell us:

- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.

- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don't have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? 

We are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a '-', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives '-' then L must be at position 3? Etc.

But it's fine.

I think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.

So guess: ""LEGGY""

But let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.

Therefore, we return ""LEGGY"".After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.
- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.
- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.

The new guess must:
1. Include both E and L (known present letters).
2. Place E in position 2 or 3.
3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn't conflict with E).
4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
5. Form a valid English word.

Given E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:
- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).
- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).
- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).
- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).
- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.

Using ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:
- Determines E's position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it's confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.
- Tests L in position 1.
- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.

Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.\n\n We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since the word must have an E, and we don\'t know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.\n\n We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).\n\n Example words:\n   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven\'t tested T, I, M, S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don\'t know about other letters.\n\n However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.\n\n But let\'s consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.\n\n Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn\'t say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don\'t know the position. However, we know it\'s not in the 5th.\n\n Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:\n\n   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T\'s? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\n   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don\'t know.\n\n   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.\n\n   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.\n\n   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.\n\n Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.\n\n Some options:\n\n   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That\'s okay.\n\n   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.\n\n   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E\'s? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple. But we can try.\n\n   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\n   But we are allowed to use multiple E\'s? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.\n\n   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.\n\n   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.\n\n   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.\n\n   But we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it\'s okay.\n\n   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: \n        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.\n\n   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.\n\n   Both are good.\n\n   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E\'s? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are allowed to use two E\'s? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E\'s, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E\'s, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one \'-\' for the correct one and an \'x\' for the 5th? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.\n\n   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.\n\n   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid R.\n\n   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.\n\n   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.\n\n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). \n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.\n\n   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.\n\n   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.\n\n   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it\'s still common.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\n   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.\n\n   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.\n\n   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?\n\n   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.\n   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.\n\n   We have 4 new letters in each.\n\n   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).\n   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).\n\n   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.\n\n   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s in another position.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""TIMES"".\n\n   Guess: ""TIMES""\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).\n- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.\n\n""TIMES"" fits these criteria:\n- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).\n- No C, R, A, N.\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)\nMeaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.\n2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n3. Tries to test new common letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven\'t tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ E _ _\n\nWe need to form valid words.\n\nSince E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.\n\nOption 1: E in position 1\n- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. \n- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.\n\nWe must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.\n\nAnother word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E\'s, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.\n\nHow about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.\n\nSo discard.\n\nAnother: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we don\'t know about X? That\'s a rare letter. We might get less information.\n\nOption 2: E in position 2\n- Pattern: _ E _ _ _\n- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.\n- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.\n\nHow about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don\'t have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L\'s? That\'s acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid duplicates.\n\nHowever, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.\n\nOption 3: E in position 3\n- Pattern: _ _ E _ _\n- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.\n\nHow about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won\'t be correct. We can put it but we know it will be \'-\' if it\'s not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.\n\nIn this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.\n\nLet\'s find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.\n\n""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.\n\n""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo it\'s getting hard.\n\nBack to E in position 1 or 2.\n\nEarlier, we had two candidates:\n- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\n- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\n\nAlso other possibilities?\n\nHow about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.\n\n""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give \'-\' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be \'check\'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave \'-\' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won\'t be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get \'-\' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.\n\nIn ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E\'s? But the secret word has only one E? We don\'t know. It might have two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.\n\nLet me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.\n\nSo for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.\n\nAnother word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.\n\n""ELBOW"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.\n\nBut we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.\n\nAnother: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo back to:\nOption E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)\nOption E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\nOption E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\nOption E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo ""EBONY"" is invalid.\n\nAnother E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let\'s assume we stick to common words.\n\nSo candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""\n\nNow compare:\n- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.\n- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.\n- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.\n\nWe want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nThe most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nTherefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L\'s? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L\'s? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.\n\n""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.\n\n""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).\n\nSo for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.\n\nBut E position is different.\n\nWe know E must be present, but we don\'t know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get \'-\' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If \'-\', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.\n\nBut we are also covering other letters.\n\nI think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.\n\nLet me confirm if there are better words.\n\nAnother possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.\n\n""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.\n\n""AXLED""?: Not common.\n\n""UGLED""? Not common.\n\nSo sticking with E at 1 or 2.\n\nAnother word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".\n\nGuess: ""ELBOW""\n\nIn this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each.\n\nSo response format:\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).\n- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.\n\nStrategy:\n- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.\n- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.\n- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.\n\nSelected guess: ""ELBOW""\n- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.\n- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.\n- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We\'ve had three guesses so far:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n- Meaning: E is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got \'-\'). T, I, M, S are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\n- Meaning: \n  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got \'-\')\n  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got \'-\')\n  - B, O, W are not in the word.\n\nSo from all the feedback:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. \nThat is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.\n\nPresent letters (but position unknown): E and L.\n\nWe know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got \'-\', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: We don\'t have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven\'t tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.\n\nWe have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).\n\nWe need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:\n\n- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can\'t be at 1,4,5).\n- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.\n\nWe need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it\'s not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we\'ll get \'-\' again? That wouldn\'t help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it\'s inefficient. So let\'s put L in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?\n\nBut we don\'t know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n\n- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.\n\n- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.\n\nWe have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word that:\n\n- Has E at position 2 or 3.\n- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).\n\nHowever, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nAlso, we must have a valid word.\n\nNow, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don\'t know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.\n\nLet me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.\n\nFirst, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _\n\nWe need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:\n\nPosition 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).\nPosition 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.\n\nExample words:\n\n- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven\'t tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.\n\nSo ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.\n\n- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ \n  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? \n\nBut we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.\n\nWhat words? For example:\n  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? \n\n""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don\'t know how many E\'s? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.\n\nBut for this pattern: _ E _ L _\n\n  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.\n\n  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.\n\n  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nE at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L\n\nWords: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""VEXEL"" Not a common word.\n\nAlternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _\n\nThen we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.\n\nSo L must be at 1,4,5.\n\nExample: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ \n\nWords? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.\n\nOr L at position 4: _ _ E L _\n\nWords: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven\'t tested them? But also, two L\'s? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? \n\nBut E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?\n\n""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L\n\nWords: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.\n\n""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo one possibility: ""QUELL""\n\nBut let\'s see:\n\nPattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.\n\nSo letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don\'t know.\n\nAlso, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.\n\nIs ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".\n\nBut Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.\n\nAnother option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.\n\nE at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don\'t know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.\n\nBut E cannot be in the end.\n\nTherefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _\n\nBut then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.\n\n""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don\'t have many choices.\n\nAnother word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _\n\nWords: \n  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? \n  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.\n  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.\n\nHow about without L? But we have to include L because it\'s present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don\'t include L, we won\'t get information about its position? So it\'s better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don\'t require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don\'t have to?\n\nIn the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a \'-\' for L? No? Because if we don\'t put any L, then we don\'t get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn\'t guess it, we won\'t know.\n\nHowever, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.\n\nThus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.\n\nTherefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L\'s? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:\n\n- Position 1: Q -> new\n- Position 2: U -> new\n- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? \n- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? \n- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? \n\nThen we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a \'-\' for each? Or one might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we avoid forbidden letters.\n\nAnother possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _\n\nBut then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _\n\nBut then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.\n\nWords: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.\n\n""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.\n\nBut we have double G? That\'s fine.\n\nBut position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.\n\nIs ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.\n\nSo ""LEGGY"" is possible?\n\nBut we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.\n\n""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.\n\nWith E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _\n\nWords: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""KELEP"" -> not common.\n\n""HELIM"" not? \n\nSo difficult.\n\nTherefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""\n\nLet\'s compare:\n\n""QUELL"": \n   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get \'-\' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get \'-\' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.\n\nSimilarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don\'t know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L\'s? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it\'s at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get \'-\' for both? We also test Q and U.\n\n""LEGGY"": \n   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can\'t be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or \'-\' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?\n\nIn ""LEGGY"": \n   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? \n   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?\n   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.\n   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.\n\nSo both guesses are viable.\n\nBut let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.\n\nAdditionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nTherefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?\n\nBut also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G\'s? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut we can also consider: we haven\'t used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.\n\nAnother word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".\n\nLet me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).\n\nThen feedback will tell us:\n\n- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.\n\n- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don\'t have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? \n\nWe are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a \'-\', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives \'-\' then L must be at position 3? Etc.\n\nBut it\'s fine.\n\nI think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo guess: ""LEGGY""\n\nBut let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we return ""LEGGY"".After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.\n- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.\n- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.\n- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.\n\nThe new guess must:\n1. Include both E and L (known present letters).\n2. Place E in position 2 or 3.\n3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn\'t conflict with E).\n4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).\n5. Form a valid English word.\n\nGiven E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:\n- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).\n- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).\n- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).\n- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).\n- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.\n\nUsing ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:\n- Determines E\'s position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it\'s confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.\n- Tests L in position 1.\n- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.\n\n<guess>leggy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\nGuess 4: leggy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have received feedback from Guess 4: ""leggy"" -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)

Breaking it down:
- L(-): The letter L is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since we put it in position 1).
- E(✓): The letter E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E as the second letter.
- G(x): The letter G is NOT in the word. Since we have two G's and both got (x), G is not in the secret word at all.
- Y(✓): The letter Y is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 5 is Y (fixed).
- The letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1, and not in position 2 (since that's E) or position 5 (Y). So L must be in position 3 or position 4.
- The word does NOT contain G (and also all previously absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W).

Additionally, we know E is at position 2 and Y at position 5, and L is present, so the remaining positions to fill are 1, 3, and 4? Actually, let's list the positions:
- Position 1: unknown (but cannot be L? because we know L is not here? Actually, we only know that L is not at position 1? But L could be at position 3 or 4).
- Position 2: E (known)
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: Y (known).

But we also know L must be in position 3 or 4? So the word looks like: _ E _ _ Y, and either position 3 or 4 must be L? And the other position is another letter? Also, position 1 is a letter.

Moreover, we have the letter L that must be placed, and it's not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So:

Pattern: ? E (L or ?) (L or ?) Y

But we cannot have L in both positions? Or we can? The word might have duplicate L? But we only know L is present? So possibly duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence? So it might be.

But we don't know? So we must consider that L could be at position 3 and/or position 4? Or only one of them?

Since we have only one L marked present? But in previous feedback? From guess 3 (elbow): L was marked '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2? And we had one L? Then in guess4: L was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning present but not at position 1? So we know there is at least one L? And it must be at position 3 or 4? Or both? But we cannot tell? So we should test a word that places L in one of these positions? And see? Or a word that has L only in one? To avoid confusion.

Also, we know the absent letters: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And from guess2 and guess1? So the forbidden letters are: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And also B,O,W from guess3? Yes.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, and we have E and Y fixed? But we know E and Y? So when forming words, we can include only letters from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, plus L? And L must be present? So the words must include L? And have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.

Thus, the word must match: _ E _ _ Y, with position 3 or 4 (or both) being L? But not necessarily? L must be somewhere? But it could be at position 1? But no? We know L is not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So actually, one of position 3 or 4 must be L? Or both? But we don't know. So we must choose a word that has L at either position 3 or position 4? And the other positions? Position 1 can be any available letter? And the other position (if not L) also?

For example:
- If L is at position 3: then word is: _ E L _ Y
- If L is at position 4: then word is: _ E _ L Y

And the blank positions? One is position 1? The other is the remaining position? For the first case: positions 4 is to fill? And position 1? Similarly for the second case?

We have to form valid English words? So we need to find words that fit one of these patterns? Or have L in position 3 or 4? But since we don't know, we must choose a word for one of the cases? And then we will learn? Because after this guess, we get feedback? For example, if we put L in position 3 and it is correct, we get a check? Else if present but wrong position, we get '-', etc.? So we can decide to test position 3 or position 4?

But we need to choose a word? So we pick one possibility? Or pick a word that works for either? We have to guess a word? So we choose a word that has L at position 3? Or at position 4? And also fill the other blanks with common letters.

Moreover, since we have very few letters available? Let's list all possible words that fit:

First pattern: _ E L _ Y

We need to fill position 1 and position 4?

Position 4? It must be a letter? And position 1 a letter? From available letters? Without the forbidden ones.

Also, the word must include L? Which is already at position 3? So we have that? Now, we need to find a valid word: some letters at position 1 and position 4? From: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z? And remember, the letter we choose must form a word? Also, the word must have E and L? And Y? Which we have? So let's think:

Words: 
- ""KELLY""? K, E, L, L, Y? But double L? And position 1: K? Position 4: L? So yes? Then the word would be K E L L Y? That spells ""KELLY""? Is that a word? Yes, a name? But in Wordle, names? Usually allow common names? Or just dictionary? But ""Kelly"" is both? And it fits: K(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5). Also, avoids forbidden? Letters K, L? L we are using? E and Y? So forbidden? No forbidden letters? And L is duplicated? That's acceptable.

But note: in feedback? For guess4? We had Y(✓) at position 5, so Y is fixed? And E(✓) at position 2? So ""KELLY"" has E at 2? And Y at 5? And L at positions 3 and 4? So it includes L in both positions? So if the secret word is ""KELLY""? Then we get all correct? But we don't know yet? But we can guess it? If it is, we win.

Other words: ""DAILY""? D, A, I, L, Y? But A and I are absent? Cannot use.

""HELPY""? Not common? 

""JELLY""? J, E, L, L, Y? Same as Kelly? Only different first letter? J? So ""JELLY"" -> J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""FELLY""? Not common? Or ""felly"" is a word? Perhaps.

Another: ""VELLY""? Not common.

Also: ""DELI Y""? Not? We need position 4 to be something? If only one L? Then position 4? For example, ""DELAY""? D, E, L, A, Y? But A absent? Cannot.

""HELPY"" is not in dictionary? 

How about ""BELLY""? B, E, L, L, Y? But B is absent? From elbow? We had B(x)? So cannot use B.

Similarly, ""PELLY""? Not common.

But JELLY or KELLY seem good? And FILLY? But I is absent? Cannot.

Second pattern: _ E _ L Y

So word: ? E ? L Y

Then we need position 1 and position 3? For example:

""FEU L Y""? Not? ""Felly""? ""Felly"" is the rim of a wheel? Valid? But F, E, L, L, Y? So positions: F(1), E(2), L(3? But no? Pattern _ E _ L Y -> position 1: ? position 3: ? position 4: L? So for example: 
- Position 1: D? Position 3: U? Then ""DEULY""? Not a word.
- Better: ""DEVLY""? Not.

""PEILY""? Not.

So it seems that the pattern with L in position 3 and 4 like JELLY or KELLY might be the only options? Or words like ""DELHY"" not.

What about ""JOLEDY""? No? 

Considering both patterns, words like KELLY or JELLY fit the first pattern: _ E L L Y? With position 3=L and position 4=L? So double L.

But we know L is present? And we don't know if duplicated? But KELLY and JELLY are valid? So we can choose one? They differ only in the first letter? K or J.

Now, which one to choose?

We must pick one? Or since we have E and Y fixed? And then L at positions? Both K and J are equally likely? Based on letter frequency, K is more common? But J is less common? But let's pick ""JELLY"" because J is less frequent? Or we already have J untested? Same as K.

To cover more possibilities? But if we choose JELLY and it's not, we learn about J? Similarly for KELLY? We learn about K.

Also, note: in position 1? It can be any letter? So there might be other possibilities? For example, if L is only at one position? Say position 3? But then we need a word like: _ E L ? Y? Where position 4 is not L? So ? E L ? Y? But we have to fill position 1 and position 4? With available letters? And form a word.

For example: 
- ""HEL M Y""? Not.
- ""HELP Y""? Not? We need one letter? ""HELPY"" is not a word.
- ""HOMEY""? But O absent? Cannot.
- ""FISHY""? F, I, S, H, Y? I and S absent? Cannot.

Perhaps ""PEDLY""? Not common.

Or ""VEDLY"" not.

Therefore, maybe the only common words are with double L? At positions 3 and 4? So ""KELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are both valid? Also ""FELLY""? But F is available? ""FELLY"" meaning the edge of a box? Or something? But it's less common than JELLY? So JELLY and KELLY are better.

Also, ""TELLY"" for television? But T is absent? Cannot.

Therefore, we choose between JELLY and KELLY?

But we have only two guesses left? And we have used 4? So this is guess 5? And we have one more after this? So we can try one? And if we are wrong, the next one? But we want to maximize efficiency? So perhaps chose one that also tests common letters? But K and J? Both are uncommon? J is least common? So if we choose JELLY and J is absent, we later know? Similarly?

But let's list the remaining possible words? Actually, the secret word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5? And L at position 3 or 4? Or both? And the first letter must be one from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

If the word has two L's? Then it must be: ? E L L Y? With the first letter allowed? So: JELLY? KELLY? FELLY? PELLY? VEILY? Not? Only few: like DELIY not? So only with double L? Probably the common ones are JELLY, KELLY? And FELLY? But less common? ZELLY not? Etc.

If the word has L only at position 3? Then ? E L ? Y? Position 4? Must be a letter? From available? And the word must be valid? 

Possible: 
- ""HELVY"" not a word?
- ""DELVY""? Not?
- ""KELPY"": K, E, L, P, Y? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of seaweed? So ""KELPY"" -> K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So positions: E at2, Y at5, L at position3? And no L at position4? So it fits? And P is available? And K? Not forbidden? So KELPY is a valid word? Also, KELP is a word? KELPY? Kelp is a kelpy? Actually, ""kelpy"" is listed in dictionaries? We are to assume it's valid? Similarly.

Another: ""JELPY""? Not common? But ""JELPY"" might not be a word? Only KELPY?

Similarly, other possibilities like ""HELPY"" not.

Or ""VELVY"" not common.

Or ""DEV I Y"" not? 

But with L at position4? Pattern ? E ? L Y? Then words: 
- ""EXILY"" not? 
- ""AUSLY"" not?
- Perhaps ""PULLY""? But U? And L? But ""PULLY"": P, U, L, L, Y? So U? Y? But pattern: P(1),E(2),? Position3? But if position3? We need? E at2? Position3? Then L at4? So like P E V L Y? Not a word? Or ""BYLLY"" not? 

So only real possibilities: 
- Double L: JELLY, KELLY, FELLY, PELLY, etc? but only JELLY and KELLY are common? And FELLY? And PELLY? Not as common? Perhaps KELPY? Which has one L? 

So possible words: KELLY, JELLY, KELPY, etc? 

We need to include L? And we know L is present? So for KELPY? It has L? So it's possible? And also, other possibilities? Like KELPY where L is at position3? No? In KELPY, L is at position3? And position4 is P? 

So to maximize information? We can guess a word that tests both possibilities? Or choose a word that covers common letters? Since we have limited options? 

But if we guess KELLY? And it's not? Then we might get feedback? For example, if the word is KELPY? Then guessing KELLY? Positions: 
- Position1: K? If secret has K? Then? 
- Position2: E(✓) -> correct
- Position3: L? In KELPY, L is also at3? So ✓? 
- Position4: L? But secret has P at position4? So minus? Because L is present? But not at position4? So L(-)? 
- Position5: Y(✓)

But then we know K? And we would know that L is not at position4? So we have two positions? And we know E and Y? And P? From the feedback? Also, we know from KELLY guess: the fourth letter is not L? So then the secret word must have L at position3? And position4? Must be? The letter we get from feedback? We can solve? But it's messy? Because we have only one guess left? 

Better to guess a word that has L at only one position? So we can isolate? 

Therefore, let's guess KELPY? Which has L only at position3? And P at position4? 

If we guess KELPY? And the secret word is KELPY? We win? 

If not? We get feedback.

Also, KELPY uses K, P? Both not tested? 

Given that, KELPY is a good candidate? 

But we must? It avoids forbidden? Letters: K, E, L, P, Y? E and Y are known? K not tested? P not tested? L is present? So valid? 

Therefore, we choose ""KELPY""

Guess: KELPY? 

But let me confirm: positions? K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So pattern? And feedback: if correct? 

But we don’t know if the secret word has L at position3? Or at position4? Or both? For KELPY, L at position3? 

The other possibility is that L at position4? So ? E ? L Y? And the word? For example, what words have L at position4? ? E ? L Y? Like ""HEPLY"" not? ""VEXLY"" not? Etc? So probably KELPY is a good word? 

So go with that.

Therefore, the guess is ""KELPY""

Response: <guess>kelpy</guess>We have specific confirmed letters and constraints:
- Position 2: E (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- Position 5: Y (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- L must be present but not in positions 1 or 2 (per `-` feedback from guesses 3 and 4) and cannot be in position 5 (since Y is fixed there), so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- G is absent (`x` in guess 4).
- Other absent letters: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

The secret word pattern is `_ E _ _ Y`, with the middle blank positions (position 3 or 4) containing L.

To maximize information with the 5th guess, ""KELPY"" is selected because:
- It positions E and Y correctly (`position 2: E`, `position 5: Y`).
- It places L in position 3 (testing one of the valid positions).
- It introduces K (new letter) and P (new letter) to test their presence.
- If ""KELPY"" is correct, we win immediately. If not, its feedback:
  - Will clarify if L is in position 3 or 4.
  - Will show if K or P are present/absent.
- ""KELPY"" (meaning a type of seaweed) is a valid uncommon word but permitted word list in Wordle-style games.

This guess efficiently narrows down remaining possibilities for the final guess if needed.

<guess>kelpy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)** → E is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: times → FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)** → E is present but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: elbow → FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)** → E is not in position 1, L is present but not in position 2, B/O/W are absent.
- **Guess 4: leggy → FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)** → E is confirmed at position 2, Y is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not in position 1, G is absent.

**Known Constraints:**
- **Fixed letters:** Position 2 is E, position 5 is Y. Secret word pattern: `? E ? ? Y`.
- **Presence requirements:** L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent letters:** A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W (cannot appear).
- **Available letters for position 1 and open slots:** D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

For the 5th guess, I prioritized:
- Placing L in position 3 (one of the possible positions) and letters K and P to test common new letter combinations.
- Using a word that fits `? E ? ? Y` and includes only available letters.
- Selecting a valid word, ""KELPY"" (a type of seaweed), which confirms E and Y positions and directly tests if L is at position 3.

This guess will clarify L's position (via feedback on its placement) and the presence/absence of K/P.

<guess>kelpy</guess>",kelpy,"We have received feedback from Guess 4: ""leggy"" -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)

Breaking it down:
- L(-): The letter L is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since we put it in position 1).
- E(✓): The letter E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E as the second letter.
- G(x): The letter G is NOT in the word. Since we have two G's and both got (x), G is not in the secret word at all.
- Y(✓): The letter Y is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 5 is Y (fixed).
- The letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1, and not in position 2 (since that's E) or position 5 (Y). So L must be in position 3 or position 4.
- The word does NOT contain G (and also all previously absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W).

Additionally, we know E is at position 2 and Y at position 5, and L is present, so the remaining positions to fill are 1, 3, and 4? Actually, let's list the positions:
- Position 1: unknown (but cannot be L? because we know L is not here? Actually, we only know that L is not at position 1? But L could be at position 3 or 4).
- Position 2: E (known)
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: Y (known).

But we also know L must be in position 3 or 4? So the word looks like: _ E _ _ Y, and either position 3 or 4 must be L? And the other position is another letter? Also, position 1 is a letter.

Moreover, we have the letter L that must be placed, and it's not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So:

Pattern: ? E (L or ?) (L or ?) Y

But we cannot have L in both positions? Or we can? The word might have duplicate L? But we only know L is present? So possibly duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence? So it might be.

But we don't know? So we must consider that L could be at position 3 and/or position 4? Or only one of them?

Since we have only one L marked present? But in previous feedback? From guess 3 (elbow): L was marked '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2? And we had one L? Then in guess4: L was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning present but not at position 1? So we know there is at least one L? And it must be at position 3 or 4? Or both? But we cannot tell? So we should test a word that places L in one of these positions? And see? Or a word that has L only in one? To avoid confusion.

Also, we know the absent letters: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And from guess2 and guess1? So the forbidden letters are: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And also B,O,W from guess3? Yes.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, and we have E and Y fixed? But we know E and Y? So when forming words, we can include only letters from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, plus L? And L must be present? So the words must include L? And have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.

Thus, the word must match: _ E _ _ Y, with position 3 or 4 (or both) being L? But not necessarily? L must be somewhere? But it could be at position 1? But no? We know L is not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So actually, one of position 3 or 4 must be L? Or both? But we don't know. So we must choose a word that has L at either position 3 or position 4? And the other positions? Position 1 can be any available letter? And the other position (if not L) also?

For example:
- If L is at position 3: then word is: _ E L _ Y
- If L is at position 4: then word is: _ E _ L Y

And the blank positions? One is position 1? The other is the remaining position? For the first case: positions 4 is to fill? And position 1? Similarly for the second case?

We have to form valid English words? So we need to find words that fit one of these patterns? Or have L in position 3 or 4? But since we don't know, we must choose a word for one of the cases? And then we will learn? Because after this guess, we get feedback? For example, if we put L in position 3 and it is correct, we get a check? Else if present but wrong position, we get '-', etc.? So we can decide to test position 3 or position 4?

But we need to choose a word? So we pick one possibility? Or pick a word that works for either? We have to guess a word? So we choose a word that has L at position 3? Or at position 4? And also fill the other blanks with common letters.

Moreover, since we have very few letters available? Let's list all possible words that fit:

First pattern: _ E L _ Y

We need to fill position 1 and position 4?

Position 4? It must be a letter? And position 1 a letter? From available letters? Without the forbidden ones.

Also, the word must include L? Which is already at position 3? So we have that? Now, we need to find a valid word: some letters at position 1 and position 4? From: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z? And remember, the letter we choose must form a word? Also, the word must have E and L? And Y? Which we have? So let's think:

Words: 
- ""KELLY""? K, E, L, L, Y? But double L? And position 1: K? Position 4: L? So yes? Then the word would be K E L L Y? That spells ""KELLY""? Is that a word? Yes, a name? But in Wordle, names? Usually allow common names? Or just dictionary? But ""Kelly"" is both? And it fits: K(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5). Also, avoids forbidden? Letters K, L? L we are using? E and Y? So forbidden? No forbidden letters? And L is duplicated? That's acceptable.

But note: in feedback? For guess4? We had Y(✓) at position 5, so Y is fixed? And E(✓) at position 2? So ""KELLY"" has E at 2? And Y at 5? And L at positions 3 and 4? So it includes L in both positions? So if the secret word is ""KELLY""? Then we get all correct? But we don't know yet? But we can guess it? If it is, we win.

Other words: ""DAILY""? D, A, I, L, Y? But A and I are absent? Cannot use.

""HELPY""? Not common? 

""JELLY""? J, E, L, L, Y? Same as Kelly? Only different first letter? J? So ""JELLY"" -> J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""FELLY""? Not common? Or ""felly"" is a word? Perhaps.

Another: ""VELLY""? Not common.

Also: ""DELI Y""? Not? We need position 4 to be something? If only one L? Then position 4? For example, ""DELAY""? D, E, L, A, Y? But A absent? Cannot.

""HELPY"" is not in dictionary? 

How about ""BELLY""? B, E, L, L, Y? But B is absent? From elbow? We had B(x)? So cannot use B.

Similarly, ""PELLY""? Not common.

But JELLY or KELLY seem good? And FILLY? But I is absent? Cannot.

Second pattern: _ E _ L Y

So word: ? E ? L Y

Then we need position 1 and position 3? For example:

""FEU L Y""? Not? ""Felly""? ""Felly"" is the rim of a wheel? Valid? But F, E, L, L, Y? So positions: F(1), E(2), L(3? But no? Pattern _ E _ L Y -> position 1: ? position 3: ? position 4: L? So for example: 
- Position 1: D? Position 3: U? Then ""DEULY""? Not a word.
- Better: ""DEVLY""? Not.

""PEILY""? Not.

So it seems that the pattern with L in position 3 and 4 like JELLY or KELLY might be the only options? Or words like ""DELHY"" not.

What about ""JOLEDY""? No? 

Considering both patterns, words like KELLY or JELLY fit the first pattern: _ E L L Y? With position 3=L and position 4=L? So double L.

But we know L is present? And we don't know if duplicated? But KELLY and JELLY are valid? So we can choose one? They differ only in the first letter? K or J.

Now, which one to choose?

We must pick one? Or since we have E and Y fixed? And then L at positions? Both K and J are equally likely? Based on letter frequency, K is more common? But J is less common? But let's pick ""JELLY"" because J is less frequent? Or we already have J untested? Same as K.

To cover more possibilities? But if we choose JELLY and it's not, we learn about J? Similarly for KELLY? We learn about K.

Also, note: in position 1? It can be any letter? So there might be other possibilities? For example, if L is only at one position? Say position 3? But then we need a word like: _ E L ? Y? Where position 4 is not L? So ? E L ? Y? But we have to fill position 1 and position 4? With available letters? And form a word.

For example: 
- ""HEL M Y""? Not.
- ""HELP Y""? Not? We need one letter? ""HELPY"" is not a word.
- ""HOMEY""? But O absent? Cannot.
- ""FISHY""? F, I, S, H, Y? I and S absent? Cannot.

Perhaps ""PEDLY""? Not common.

Or ""VEDLY"" not.

Therefore, maybe the only common words are with double L? At positions 3 and 4? So ""KELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are both valid? Also ""FELLY""? But F is available? ""FELLY"" meaning the edge of a box? Or something? But it's less common than JELLY? So JELLY and KELLY are better.

Also, ""TELLY"" for television? But T is absent? Cannot.

Therefore, we choose between JELLY and KELLY?

But we have only two guesses left? And we have used 4? So this is guess 5? And we have one more after this? So we can try one? And if we are wrong, the next one? But we want to maximize efficiency? So perhaps chose one that also tests common letters? But K and J? Both are uncommon? J is least common? So if we choose JELLY and J is absent, we later know? Similarly?

But let's list the remaining possible words? Actually, the secret word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5? And L at position 3 or 4? Or both? And the first letter must be one from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

If the word has two L's? Then it must be: ? E L L Y? With the first letter allowed? So: JELLY? KELLY? FELLY? PELLY? VEILY? Not? Only few: like DELIY not? So only with double L? Probably the common ones are JELLY, KELLY? And FELLY? But less common? ZELLY not? Etc.

If the word has L only at position 3? Then ? E L ? Y? Position 4? Must be a letter? From available? And the word must be valid? 

Possible: 
- ""HELVY"" not a word?
- ""DELVY""? Not?
- ""KELPY"": K, E, L, P, Y? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of seaweed? So ""KELPY"" -> K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So positions: E at2, Y at5, L at position3? And no L at position4? So it fits? And P is available? And K? Not forbidden? So KELPY is a valid word? Also, KELP is a word? KELPY? Kelp is a kelpy? Actually, ""kelpy"" is listed in dictionaries? We are to assume it's valid? Similarly.

Another: ""JELPY""? Not common? But ""JELPY"" might not be a word? Only KELPY?

Similarly, other possibilities like ""HELPY"" not.

Or ""VELVY"" not common.

Or ""DEV I Y"" not? 

But with L at position4? Pattern ? E ? L Y? Then words: 
- ""EXILY"" not? 
- ""AUSLY"" not?
- Perhaps ""PULLY""? But U? And L? But ""PULLY"": P, U, L, L, Y? So U? Y? But pattern: P(1),E(2),? Position3? But if position3? We need? E at2? Position3? Then L at4? So like P E V L Y? Not a word? Or ""BYLLY"" not? 

So only real possibilities: 
- Double L: JELLY, KELLY, FELLY, PELLY, etc? but only JELLY and KELLY are common? And FELLY? And PELLY? Not as common? Perhaps KELPY? Which has one L? 

So possible words: KELLY, JELLY, KELPY, etc? 

We need to include L? And we know L is present? So for KELPY? It has L? So it's possible? And also, other possibilities? Like KELPY where L is at position3? No? In KELPY, L is at position3? And position4 is P? 

So to maximize information? We can guess a word that tests both possibilities? Or choose a word that covers common letters? Since we have limited options? 

But if we guess KELLY? And it's not? Then we might get feedback? For example, if the word is KELPY? Then guessing KELLY? Positions: 
- Position1: K? If secret has K? Then? 
- Position2: E(✓) -> correct
- Position3: L? In KELPY, L is also at3? So ✓? 
- Position4: L? But secret has P at position4? So minus? Because L is present? But not at position4? So L(-)? 
- Position5: Y(✓)

But then we know K? And we would know that L is not at position4? So we have two positions? And we know E and Y? And P? From the feedback? Also, we know from KELLY guess: the fourth letter is not L? So then the secret word must have L at position3? And position4? Must be? The letter we get from feedback? We can solve? But it's messy? Because we have only one guess left? 

Better to guess a word that has L at only one position? So we can isolate? 

Therefore, let's guess KELPY? Which has L only at position3? And P at position4? 

If we guess KELPY? And the secret word is KELPY? We win? 

If not? We get feedback.

Also, KELPY uses K, P? Both not tested? 

Given that, KELPY is a good candidate? 

But we must? It avoids forbidden? Letters: K, E, L, P, Y? E and Y are known? K not tested? P not tested? L is present? So valid? 

Therefore, we choose ""KELPY""

Guess: KELPY? 

But let me confirm: positions? K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So pattern? And feedback: if correct? 

But we don’t know if the secret word has L at position3? Or at position4? Or both? For KELPY, L at position3? 

The other possibility is that L at position4? So ? E ? L Y? And the word? For example, what words have L at position4? ? E ? L Y? Like ""HEPLY"" not? ""VEXLY"" not? Etc? So probably KELPY is a good word? 

So go with that.

Therefore, the guess is ""KELPY""

Response: <guess>kelpy</guess>We have specific confirmed letters and constraints:
- Position 2: E (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- Position 5: Y (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- L must be present but not in positions 1 or 2 (per `-` feedback from guesses 3 and 4) and cannot be in position 5 (since Y is fixed there), so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- G is absent (`x` in guess 4).
- Other absent letters: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

The secret word pattern is `_ E _ _ Y`, with the middle blank positions (position 3 or 4) containing L.

To maximize information with the 5th guess, ""KELPY"" is selected because:
- It positions E and Y correctly (`position 2: E`, `position 5: Y`).
- It places L in position 3 (testing one of the valid positions).
- It introduces K (new letter) and P (new letter) to test their presence.
- If ""KELPY"" is correct, we win immediately. If not, its feedback:
  - Will clarify if L is in position 3 or 4.
  - Will show if K or P are present/absent.
- ""KELPY"" (meaning a type of seaweed) is a valid uncommon word but permitted word list in Wordle-style games.

This guess efficiently narrows down remaining possibilities for the final guess if needed.

<guess>kelpy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)** → E is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: times → FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)** → E is present but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: elbow → FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)** → E is not in position 1, L is present but not in position 2, B/O/W are absent.
- **Guess 4: leggy → FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)** → E is confirmed at position 2, Y is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not in position 1, G is absent.

**Known Constraints:**
- **Fixed letters:** Position 2 is E, position 5 is Y. Secret word pattern: `? E ? ? Y`.
- **Presence requirements:** L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent letters:** A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W (cannot appear).
- **Available letters for position 1 and open slots:** D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

For the 5th guess, I prioritized:
- Placing L in position 3 (one of the possible positions) and letters K and P to test common new letter combinations.
- Using a word that fits `? E ? ? Y` and includes only available letters.
- Selecting a valid word, ""KELPY"" (a type of seaweed), which confirms E and Y positions and directly tests if L is at position 3.

This guess will clarify L's position (via feedback on its placement) and the presence/absence of K/P.",Guess 5: kelpy -> FEEDBACK: K(x) E(✓) L(✓) P(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,jelly,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Let's choose a word with common consonants and vowels. One common starting word is ""SALET"" or ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"". I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 After submitting ""CRANE"", we'll get feedback. But since this is the first guess, we just need to pick one.

 Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - The letter 'E' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it's present but wrong position).
   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an 'E' and it must be in one of the first four positions.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).
   - Contains the letter 'E', but not in the 5th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.

 We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.

 Since the word must have an E, and we don't know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

 We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).

 Example words:
   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven't tested T, I, M, S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don't know about other letters.

 However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.

 Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn't say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don't know the position. However, we know it's not in the 5th.

 Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:

   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T's? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E's? That might be acceptable.

   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don't know.

   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.

   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.

   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.

 Some options:

   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.

   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That's okay.

   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.

   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E's? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple. But we can try.

   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don't know.

   But we are allowed to use multiple E's? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.

   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.

   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.

   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.

   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But note: we don't know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.

   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.

   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.

   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.

   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.

   But we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it's okay.

   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.

   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: 
        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That's acceptable.

   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.

   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.

   Let me compare:

   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.

   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.

   Both are good.

   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E's? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E's? However, we don't know. But we are allowed to use two E's? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E's, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a '-' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E's, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one '-' for the correct one and an 'x' for the 5th? But we don't know.

   However, to avoid confusion, it's better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.

   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.

   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.

   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.

   Therefore, we must avoid R.

   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.

   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.

   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.

   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). 

   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.

   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.

   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.

   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.

   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it's still common.

   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.

   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.

   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.

   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.

   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.

   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?

   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.

   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.
   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.

   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.

   We have 4 new letters in each.

   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).
   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).

   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.

   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it's in another position.

   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.

   So let's go with ""TIMES"".

   Guess: ""TIMES""

   We'll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.

   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.
- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.

For the second guess:
- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.
- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).
- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.

""TIMES"" fits these criteria:
- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).
- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).
- No C, R, A, N.

<guess>times</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)
Meaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").

So we know:
- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.
2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
3. Tries to test new common letters.

Available letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven't tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ E _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ E _ _

We need to form valid words.

Since E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.

Let's brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. 
- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.

We must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.

Another word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E's, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.

How about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.

So discard.

Another: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That's acceptable.

But we don't know about X? That's a rare letter. We might get less information.

Option 2: E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ _
- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.
- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.

How about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.

""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don't have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L's? That's acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn't forbid duplicates.

However, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.

Option 3: E in position 3
- Pattern: _ _ E _ _
- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.
- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.
- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.

""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.

How about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won't be correct. We can put it but we know it will be '-' if it's not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.

In this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.

Let's find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.

""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.

""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.

So it's getting hard.

Back to E in position 1 or 2.

Earlier, we had two candidates:
- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)

Also other possibilities?

How about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.

""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.

""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give '-' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be 'check'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave '-' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.

Therefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won't be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get '-' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.

In ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E's? But the secret word has only one E? We don't know. It might have two E's.

Alternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.

Let me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.

So for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.

Another word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.

""ELBOW"" is a valid word.

Similarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.

""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.

""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.

But we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.

Another: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.

So back to:
Option E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)
Option E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)
Option E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)
Option E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

So ""EBONY"" is invalid.

Another E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let's assume we stick to common words.

So candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""

Now compare:
- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.
- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.
- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.

We want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.

The most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.

Therefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L's? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L's? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.

Similarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.

""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.

""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).

So for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.

But E position is different.

We know E must be present, but we don't know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get '-' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If '-', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.

But we are also covering other letters.

I think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.

Let me confirm if there are better words.

Another possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.

""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.

""AXLED""?: Not common.

""UGLED""? Not common.

So sticking with E at 1 or 2.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.

Therefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".

Guess: ""ELBOW""

In this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.

We'll get feedback on each.

So response format:

<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).

Key insights:
- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.
- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Strategy:
- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.
- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.
- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.

Selected guess: ""ELBOW""
- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.
- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.
- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.

<guess>elbow</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Guess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We've had three guesses so far:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5). C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
- Meaning: E is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it there and got '-'). T, I, M, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
- Meaning: 
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got '-')
  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got '-')
  - B, O, W are not in the word.

So from all the feedback:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. 
That is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

Present letters (but position unknown): E and L.

We know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.

Similarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got '-', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: We don't have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven't tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.

Also, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.

We have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).

We need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:

- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can't be at 1,4,5).
- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.

We also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.

We need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it's not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we'll get '-' again? That wouldn't help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it's inefficient. So let's put L in a position we haven't tried.

Similarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?

But we don't know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.

Let's consider:

- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.

- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.

We have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.

So let's try to form a word that:

- Has E at position 2 or 3.
- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).

However, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.

Also, we must have a valid word.

Now, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don't know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.

Let me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.

First, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _

We need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:

Position 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).
Position 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.

Example words:

- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven't tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.

So ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.

- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ 
  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? 

But we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.

What words? For example:
  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? 

""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don't know how many E's? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.

But for this pattern: _ E _ L _

  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.

  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.

  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.

It's hard.

E at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L

Words: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.

""VEXEL"" Not a common word.

Alternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _

Then we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.

So L must be at 1,4,5.

Example: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ 

Words? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.

""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.

""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.

Or L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven't tested them? But also, two L's? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? 

But E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?

""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L

Words: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.

""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.

So one possibility: ""QUELL""

But let's see:

Pattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.

So letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L's? That's fine.

But note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don't know.

Also, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.

Is ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".

But Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.

Another option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.

E at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don't know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.

Similarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.

But E cannot be in the end.

Therefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _

But then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.

Another word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.

""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.

""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.

So maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.

So ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don't have many choices.

Another word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _

Words: 
  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? 
  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.
  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.

How about without L? But we have to include L because it's present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don't include L, we won't get information about its position? So it's better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don't require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don't have to?

In the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a '-' for L? No? Because if we don't put any L, then we don't get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn't guess it, we won't know.

However, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.

Thus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.

Therefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L's? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:

- Position 1: Q -> new
- Position 2: U -> new
- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? 
- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? 
- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? 

Then we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a '-' for each? Or one might be correct? We don't know.

But we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _

But then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _

But then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.

Words: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.

""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.

""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.

But we have double G? That's fine.

But position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.

Is ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.

Similarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.

So ""LEGGY"" is possible?

But we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.

""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.

With E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _

Words: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.

""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.

""KELEP"" -> not common.

""HELIM"" not? 

So difficult.

Therefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""

Let's compare:

""QUELL"": 
   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get '-' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get '-' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.

Similarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don't know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L's? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it's at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get '-' for both? We also test Q and U.

""LEGGY"": 
   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can't be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or '-' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?

In ""LEGGY"": 
   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? 
   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?
   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.
   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.

So both guesses are viable.

But let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.

Additionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.

Therefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?

But also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G's? But that's fine.

But we can also consider: we haven't used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.

Another word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.

So we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.

But we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.

Therefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".

Let me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).

Then feedback will tell us:

- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.

- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don't have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? 

We are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a '-', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives '-' then L must be at position 3? Etc.

But it's fine.

I think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.

So guess: ""LEGGY""

But let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.

Therefore, we return ""LEGGY"".After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.
- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.
- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.

The new guess must:
1. Include both E and L (known present letters).
2. Place E in position 2 or 3.
3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn't conflict with E).
4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).
5. Form a valid English word.

Given E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:
- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).
- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).
- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).
- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).
- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.

Using ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:
- Determines E's position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it's confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.
- Tests L in position 1.
- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.

<guess>leggy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)
Guess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)
Guess 4: leggy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have received feedback from Guess 4: ""leggy"" -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)

Breaking it down:
- L(-): The letter L is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since we put it in position 1).
- E(✓): The letter E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E as the second letter.
- G(x): The letter G is NOT in the word. Since we have two G's and both got (x), G is not in the secret word at all.
- Y(✓): The letter Y is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 2 is E (fixed).
- Position 5 is Y (fixed).
- The letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1, and not in position 2 (since that's E) or position 5 (Y). So L must be in position 3 or position 4.
- The word does NOT contain G (and also all previously absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W).

Additionally, we know E is at position 2 and Y at position 5, and L is present, so the remaining positions to fill are 1, 3, and 4? Actually, let's list the positions:
- Position 1: unknown (but cannot be L? because we know L is not here? Actually, we only know that L is not at position 1? But L could be at position 3 or 4).
- Position 2: E (known)
- Position 3: unknown
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: Y (known).

But we also know L must be in position 3 or 4? So the word looks like: _ E _ _ Y, and either position 3 or 4 must be L? And the other position is another letter? Also, position 1 is a letter.

Moreover, we have the letter L that must be placed, and it's not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So:

Pattern: ? E (L or ?) (L or ?) Y

But we cannot have L in both positions? Or we can? The word might have duplicate L? But we only know L is present? So possibly duplicated? But we haven't seen evidence? So it might be.

But we don't know? So we must consider that L could be at position 3 and/or position 4? Or only one of them?

Since we have only one L marked present? But in previous feedback? From guess 3 (elbow): L was marked '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2? And we had one L? Then in guess4: L was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning present but not at position 1? So we know there is at least one L? And it must be at position 3 or 4? Or both? But we cannot tell? So we should test a word that places L in one of these positions? And see? Or a word that has L only in one? To avoid confusion.

Also, we know the absent letters: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And from guess2 and guess1? So the forbidden letters are: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And also B,O,W from guess3? Yes.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, and we have E and Y fixed? But we know E and Y? So when forming words, we can include only letters from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, plus L? And L must be present? So the words must include L? And have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.

Thus, the word must match: _ E _ _ Y, with position 3 or 4 (or both) being L? But not necessarily? L must be somewhere? But it could be at position 1? But no? We know L is not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So actually, one of position 3 or 4 must be L? Or both? But we don't know. So we must choose a word that has L at either position 3 or position 4? And the other positions? Position 1 can be any available letter? And the other position (if not L) also?

For example:
- If L is at position 3: then word is: _ E L _ Y
- If L is at position 4: then word is: _ E _ L Y

And the blank positions? One is position 1? The other is the remaining position? For the first case: positions 4 is to fill? And position 1? Similarly for the second case?

We have to form valid English words? So we need to find words that fit one of these patterns? Or have L in position 3 or 4? But since we don't know, we must choose a word for one of the cases? And then we will learn? Because after this guess, we get feedback? For example, if we put L in position 3 and it is correct, we get a check? Else if present but wrong position, we get '-', etc.? So we can decide to test position 3 or position 4?

But we need to choose a word? So we pick one possibility? Or pick a word that works for either? We have to guess a word? So we choose a word that has L at position 3? Or at position 4? And also fill the other blanks with common letters.

Moreover, since we have very few letters available? Let's list all possible words that fit:

First pattern: _ E L _ Y

We need to fill position 1 and position 4?

Position 4? It must be a letter? And position 1 a letter? From available letters? Without the forbidden ones.

Also, the word must include L? Which is already at position 3? So we have that? Now, we need to find a valid word: some letters at position 1 and position 4? From: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z? And remember, the letter we choose must form a word? Also, the word must have E and L? And Y? Which we have? So let's think:

Words: 
- ""KELLY""? K, E, L, L, Y? But double L? And position 1: K? Position 4: L? So yes? Then the word would be K E L L Y? That spells ""KELLY""? Is that a word? Yes, a name? But in Wordle, names? Usually allow common names? Or just dictionary? But ""Kelly"" is both? And it fits: K(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5). Also, avoids forbidden? Letters K, L? L we are using? E and Y? So forbidden? No forbidden letters? And L is duplicated? That's acceptable.

But note: in feedback? For guess4? We had Y(✓) at position 5, so Y is fixed? And E(✓) at position 2? So ""KELLY"" has E at 2? And Y at 5? And L at positions 3 and 4? So it includes L in both positions? So if the secret word is ""KELLY""? Then we get all correct? But we don't know yet? But we can guess it? If it is, we win.

Other words: ""DAILY""? D, A, I, L, Y? But A and I are absent? Cannot use.

""HELPY""? Not common? 

""JELLY""? J, E, L, L, Y? Same as Kelly? Only different first letter? J? So ""JELLY"" -> J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""FELLY""? Not common? Or ""felly"" is a word? Perhaps.

Another: ""VELLY""? Not common.

Also: ""DELI Y""? Not? We need position 4 to be something? If only one L? Then position 4? For example, ""DELAY""? D, E, L, A, Y? But A absent? Cannot.

""HELPY"" is not in dictionary? 

How about ""BELLY""? B, E, L, L, Y? But B is absent? From elbow? We had B(x)? So cannot use B.

Similarly, ""PELLY""? Not common.

But JELLY or KELLY seem good? And FILLY? But I is absent? Cannot.

Second pattern: _ E _ L Y

So word: ? E ? L Y

Then we need position 1 and position 3? For example:

""FEU L Y""? Not? ""Felly""? ""Felly"" is the rim of a wheel? Valid? But F, E, L, L, Y? So positions: F(1), E(2), L(3? But no? Pattern _ E _ L Y -> position 1: ? position 3: ? position 4: L? So for example: 
- Position 1: D? Position 3: U? Then ""DEULY""? Not a word.
- Better: ""DEVLY""? Not.

""PEILY""? Not.

So it seems that the pattern with L in position 3 and 4 like JELLY or KELLY might be the only options? Or words like ""DELHY"" not.

What about ""JOLEDY""? No? 

Considering both patterns, words like KELLY or JELLY fit the first pattern: _ E L L Y? With position 3=L and position 4=L? So double L.

But we know L is present? And we don't know if duplicated? But KELLY and JELLY are valid? So we can choose one? They differ only in the first letter? K or J.

Now, which one to choose?

We must pick one? Or since we have E and Y fixed? And then L at positions? Both K and J are equally likely? Based on letter frequency, K is more common? But J is less common? But let's pick ""JELLY"" because J is less frequent? Or we already have J untested? Same as K.

To cover more possibilities? But if we choose JELLY and it's not, we learn about J? Similarly for KELLY? We learn about K.

Also, note: in position 1? It can be any letter? So there might be other possibilities? For example, if L is only at one position? Say position 3? But then we need a word like: _ E L ? Y? Where position 4 is not L? So ? E L ? Y? But we have to fill position 1 and position 4? With available letters? And form a word.

For example: 
- ""HEL M Y""? Not.
- ""HELP Y""? Not? We need one letter? ""HELPY"" is not a word.
- ""HOMEY""? But O absent? Cannot.
- ""FISHY""? F, I, S, H, Y? I and S absent? Cannot.

Perhaps ""PEDLY""? Not common.

Or ""VEDLY"" not.

Therefore, maybe the only common words are with double L? At positions 3 and 4? So ""KELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are both valid? Also ""FELLY""? But F is available? ""FELLY"" meaning the edge of a box? Or something? But it's less common than JELLY? So JELLY and KELLY are better.

Also, ""TELLY"" for television? But T is absent? Cannot.

Therefore, we choose between JELLY and KELLY?

But we have only two guesses left? And we have used 4? So this is guess 5? And we have one more after this? So we can try one? And if we are wrong, the next one? But we want to maximize efficiency? So perhaps chose one that also tests common letters? But K and J? Both are uncommon? J is least common? So if we choose JELLY and J is absent, we later know? Similarly?

But let's list the remaining possible words? Actually, the secret word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5? And L at position 3 or 4? Or both? And the first letter must be one from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

If the word has two L's? Then it must be: ? E L L Y? With the first letter allowed? So: JELLY? KELLY? FELLY? PELLY? VEILY? Not? Only few: like DELIY not? So only with double L? Probably the common ones are JELLY, KELLY? And FELLY? But less common? ZELLY not? Etc.

If the word has L only at position 3? Then ? E L ? Y? Position 4? Must be a letter? From available? And the word must be valid? 

Possible: 
- ""HELVY"" not a word?
- ""DELVY""? Not?
- ""KELPY"": K, E, L, P, Y? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of seaweed? So ""KELPY"" -> K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So positions: E at2, Y at5, L at position3? And no L at position4? So it fits? And P is available? And K? Not forbidden? So KELPY is a valid word? Also, KELP is a word? KELPY? Kelp is a kelpy? Actually, ""kelpy"" is listed in dictionaries? We are to assume it's valid? Similarly.

Another: ""JELPY""? Not common? But ""JELPY"" might not be a word? Only KELPY?

Similarly, other possibilities like ""HELPY"" not.

Or ""VELVY"" not common.

Or ""DEV I Y"" not? 

But with L at position4? Pattern ? E ? L Y? Then words: 
- ""EXILY"" not? 
- ""AUSLY"" not?
- Perhaps ""PULLY""? But U? And L? But ""PULLY"": P, U, L, L, Y? So U? Y? But pattern: P(1),E(2),? Position3? But if position3? We need? E at2? Position3? Then L at4? So like P E V L Y? Not a word? Or ""BYLLY"" not? 

So only real possibilities: 
- Double L: JELLY, KELLY, FELLY, PELLY, etc? but only JELLY and KELLY are common? And FELLY? And PELLY? Not as common? Perhaps KELPY? Which has one L? 

So possible words: KELLY, JELLY, KELPY, etc? 

We need to include L? And we know L is present? So for KELPY? It has L? So it's possible? And also, other possibilities? Like KELPY where L is at position3? No? In KELPY, L is at position3? And position4 is P? 

So to maximize information? We can guess a word that tests both possibilities? Or choose a word that covers common letters? Since we have limited options? 

But if we guess KELLY? And it's not? Then we might get feedback? For example, if the word is KELPY? Then guessing KELLY? Positions: 
- Position1: K? If secret has K? Then? 
- Position2: E(✓) -> correct
- Position3: L? In KELPY, L is also at3? So ✓? 
- Position4: L? But secret has P at position4? So minus? Because L is present? But not at position4? So L(-)? 
- Position5: Y(✓)

But then we know K? And we would know that L is not at position4? So we have two positions? And we know E and Y? And P? From the feedback? Also, we know from KELLY guess: the fourth letter is not L? So then the secret word must have L at position3? And position4? Must be? The letter we get from feedback? We can solve? But it's messy? Because we have only one guess left? 

Better to guess a word that has L at only one position? So we can isolate? 

Therefore, let's guess KELPY? Which has L only at position3? And P at position4? 

If we guess KELPY? And the secret word is KELPY? We win? 

If not? We get feedback.

Also, KELPY uses K, P? Both not tested? 

Given that, KELPY is a good candidate? 

But we must? It avoids forbidden? Letters: K, E, L, P, Y? E and Y are known? K not tested? P not tested? L is present? So valid? 

Therefore, we choose ""KELPY""

Guess: KELPY? 

But let me confirm: positions? K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So pattern? And feedback: if correct? 

But we don’t know if the secret word has L at position3? Or at position4? Or both? For KELPY, L at position3? 

The other possibility is that L at position4? So ? E ? L Y? And the word? For example, what words have L at position4? ? E ? L Y? Like ""HEPLY"" not? ""VEXLY"" not? Etc? So probably KELPY is a good word? 

So go with that.

Therefore, the guess is ""KELPY""

Response: <guess>kelpy</guess>We have specific confirmed letters and constraints:
- Position 2: E (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- Position 5: Y (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).
- L must be present but not in positions 1 or 2 (per `-` feedback from guesses 3 and 4) and cannot be in position 5 (since Y is fixed there), so L must be in position 3 or 4.
- G is absent (`x` in guess 4).
- Other absent letters: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.

The secret word pattern is `_ E _ _ Y`, with the middle blank positions (position 3 or 4) containing L.

To maximize information with the 5th guess, ""KELPY"" is selected because:
- It positions E and Y correctly (`position 2: E`, `position 5: Y`).
- It places L in position 3 (testing one of the valid positions).
- It introduces K (new letter) and P (new letter) to test their presence.
- If ""KELPY"" is correct, we win immediately. If not, its feedback:
  - Will clarify if L is in position 3 or 4.
  - Will show if K or P are present/absent.
- ""KELPY"" (meaning a type of seaweed) is a valid uncommon word but permitted word list in Wordle-style games.

This guess efficiently narrows down remaining possibilities for the final guess if needed.

<guess>kelpy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)** → E is present but not in position 5.
- **Guess 2: times → FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)** → E is present but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: elbow → FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)** → E is not in position 1, L is present but not in position 2, B/O/W are absent.
- **Guess 4: leggy → FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)** → E is confirmed at position 2, Y is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not in position 1, G is absent.

**Known Constraints:**
- **Fixed letters:** Position 2 is E, position 5 is Y. Secret word pattern: `? E ? ? Y`.
- **Presence requirements:** L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5).
- **Absent letters:** A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W (cannot appear).
- **Available letters for position 1 and open slots:** D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

For the 5th guess, I prioritized:
- Placing L in position 3 (one of the possible positions) and letters K and P to test common new letter combinations.
- Using a word that fits `? E ? ? Y` and includes only available letters.
- Selecting a valid word, ""KELPY"" (a type of seaweed), which confirms E and Y positions and directly tests if L is at position 3.

This guess will clarify L's position (via feedback on its placement) and the presence/absence of K/P.

But since this is the first guess, we just need to pick one.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n This means:\n   - The letter \'E\' is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it is at the end, but the feedback says it\'s present but wrong position).\n   - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Since E is in the word but not in the 5th position, we know the secret word contains an \'E\' and it must be in one of the first four positions.\n\n We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are marked as absent).\n   - Contains the letter \'E\', but not in the 5th position.\n\n Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters in English: E, S, T, I, O, L, D, U, etc.\n\n We know E is in the word, so we should try to put E in a different position (not 5th). Also, we can try to include other common letters to test.\n\n Since the word must have an E, and we don\'t know its position, we can try a word that has E in the first, second, third, or fourth position.\n\n We also avoid the letters C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes E and other common letters not yet tested (like S, T, O, I, L, D, etc.).\n\n Example words:\n   - We could try ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> but E is in the 4th position (which is not 5th) and we avoid C,R,A,N. However, we haven\'t tested T, I, M, S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about C,R,A,N,E. We don\'t know about other letters.\n\n However, we must avoid C,R,A,N. So ""TIMES"" is acceptable.\n\n But let\'s consider: we want to test as many new letters as possible. Also, we know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in an earlier position to see if it fits.\n\n Another idea: since E is present, we can try a word with E in the first position? But note: the feedback didn\'t say E is in the word and in the correct position, but we don\'t know the position. However, we know it\'s not in the 5th.\n\n Let me list some words without C,R,A,N and with E not at the end:\n\n   - E in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n        Example: ""ELITE"" -> but has T and L, which are new. However, we have two T\'s? Actually, ""elite"" has E, L, I, T, E -> but we have two E\'s? That might be acceptable.\n\n   - But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique. However, in the example, they were unique. But we don\'t know.\n\n   - Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" -> S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position? Actually, in ""spiel"", the letters are S,P,I,E,L -> so E is in the 4th. But we want to avoid the 5th, so 4th is okay.\n\n   - Another: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end? We cannot put E at the end because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position. So avoid words ending with E.\n\n   - ""TABLE"" -> ends with E? Not allowed. Also, has A which is absent? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, so ""table"" is invalid because of A.\n\n Let me think of words without C,R,A,N and without E at the end, and with E in the word.\n\n Some options:\n\n   - ""SPIEL"": S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position. Letters: S, P, I, E, L -> all new except E.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": T, I, M, E, S -> E in 4th. But note: we are using S at the end? That\'s okay.\n\n   - ""DUET"": too short. Must be 5 letters.\n\n   - ""ELOPE"": E at the beginning, then L, O, P, E -> but ends with E? So the last E is at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, we have two E\'s? The feedback only said one E is present? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple. But we can try.\n\n   However, ""elope"" has E at the first and last. We know the last E is wrong because the feedback said E is not in the 5th. But the first E might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\n   But we are allowed to use multiple E\'s? However, we are avoiding the 5th position for E.\n\n   Alternatively, ""ELITE"": E at the beginning and then L, I, T, E -> again, the last letter is E, which is the 5th. So we cannot use that.\n\n   We need a word that has E but not in the 5th and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   How about ""MEDIA""? But wait, we have A? A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL""? T, O, W, E, L -> E is in the 4th? Actually, T-O-W-E-L: positions: T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). But E is in the 4th and L is in the 5th. This is acceptable because E is not in the 5th. However, we are using O, W, E, L, T. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if O, W, L, T are in the word. This is a good way to test.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E is in the 4th? Actually, P-I-L-E-D: E is in the 4th? Wait, the word is P-I-L-E-D, so E is the 4th letter and D is the 5th. So E is not at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n   We can also consider ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? So we cannot use that.\n\n   Another: ""OWLED""? Not a common word.\n\n   Let me check: ""PILED"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to have piled something.\n\n   But we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters: C,R,A,N. ""PILED"" has P, I, L, E, D -> none of C,R,A,N. So it\'s okay.\n\n   Another option: ""SMILE"": S, M, I, L, E -> ends with E? So no.\n\n   ""TOWEL"" is acceptable? T, O, W, E, L -> E is the 4th? Actually, the positions: \n        T:1, O:2, W:3, E:4, L:5 -> so E is in the 4th and L in the 5th. We are not putting E at the end? The 5th letter is L, so E is in the 4th. That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are testing the 5th letter as L, which is new.\n\n   However, we want to maximize new letters. ""PILED"" uses P, I, L, E, D -> and E is in the 4th. Similarly, ""TIMES"" uses T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Let me compare:\n\n   - ""PILED"": tests P, I, L, D and E (which we know is present, but we are testing its position again? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th, which is different from the first guess (where it was in the 5th). So we can see if E is in the 4th.\n\n   - ""TIMES"": tests T, I, M, S and E in the 4th.\n\n   Both are good.\n\n   Another common word: ""SLIME"" -> ends with E? No, because S-L-I-M-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   How about ""BEIGE""? B, E, I, G, E -> but the last letter is E? So we cannot use because of the last E. Also, we have two E\'s? The first E is in the 2nd position? But the last E is in the 5th, which is forbidden by the feedback? Actually, the feedback only said that in the first guess the E was in the 5th and it was wrong. But the word might have two E\'s? However, we don\'t know. But we are allowed to use two E\'s? But the problem is that we are forced to avoid the 5th position for E? Actually, no: the feedback said that the E in the 5th position is not correct. But if the word has two E\'s, one of which is in the 5th, then we would have gotten a \'-\' for the 5th? But the feedback for the first guess was E(-) meaning that E is in the word but not in the 5th. So the secret word has at least one E, and it is not in the 5th position. Therefore, if we put an E in the 5th in our new guess, it would be incorrect for that position, but if the word has another E elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that E? Actually, the feedback is per letter. So if we put two E\'s, one in a correct position and one in the 5th (which is wrong), then we would get one \'-\' for the correct one and an \'x\' for the 5th? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to avoid confusion, it\'s better to avoid putting E in the 5th position in this guess because we know the 5th position is not E. So we should choose a word without E in the 5th.\n\n   Therefore, ""BEIGE"" is not good because it ends with E.\n\n   Let me choose between ""PILED"" and ""TIMES"". Both are valid.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a more common word and uses very common letters. Also, it has S at the end, which is a common letter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""QUERY"" but Q is not very common and we have U, E, R, Y. But R is absent? We cannot use R because the first feedback said R is absent. So we cannot use R.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid R.\n\n   So ""TIMES"" is acceptable: T, I, M, E, S -> no R, no C, no A, no N.\n\n   Similarly, ""PILED"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another option: ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. So no.\n\n   ""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> E is in the 3rd position? F-I-E-L-D: E is the 3rd? Then L and D. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we have to consider: we are testing F, I, L, D and E (in the 3rd). \n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E in the 4th.\n\n   I think ""TIMES"" is a good choice because it has T, I, M, S which are common.\n\n   Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   Common letters: E, S, T, I, O, L, etc.\n\n   We are already using E. Then we can test S, T, I, M.\n\n   M is less common than O, L, D, etc. But it\'s still common.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use ""SLATE"" but S, L, A, T, E -> A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\n   So ""SLATE"" is invalid.\n\n   Another: ""POISE"": P, O, I, S, E -> E at the end? No, because P-O-I-S-E: E is the 5th? So we cannot use.\n\n   ""POSED"": P, O, S, E, D -> E in the 4th? P-O-S-E-D: E is the 4th? Then D at the end. This is acceptable. And we avoid C,R,A,N.\n\n   ""POSED"" tests P, O, S, E, D. This is also good.\n\n   Now, among ""TIMES"", ""PILED"", ""POSED"", ""FIELD"", ""TOWEL"", which one to choose?\n\n   We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English (after E) are: T, O, I, S, etc.\n\n   ""POSED"" has O, S, E, D, P.\n   ""TIMES"" has T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Since we already know E is in the word, we are more interested in the other letters.\n\n   We have 4 new letters in each.\n\n   The frequency of the new letters in ""TIMES"": T (very common), I (common), M (medium), S (very common).\n   In ""POSED"": P (medium), O (common), S (very common), D (common).\n\n   ""TIMES"" has two very common letters (T and S) and one common (I). ""POSED"" has one very common (S) and two common (O, D). So ""TIMES"" might be slightly better.\n\n   Also, note that we are putting E in the 4th position. If the secret word has E in the 4th, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and we know it\'s in another position.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""TIMES"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has E in the 4th? Then we get a check for E and we know the position. But if not, we know E is in one of the first three positions.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""TIMES"".\n\n   Guess: ""TIMES""\n\n   We\'ll get feedback on T, I, M, E, S.\n\n   Format: <guess>times</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they cannot be in the secret word.\n- E is present (-) but not in the 5th position, so it must appear in positions 1–4.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Avoid C, R, A, N entirely.\n- Include E in a position other than 5th (test position 4 here).\n- Introduce new common letters (T, I, M, S) to maximize information.\n\n""TIMES"" fits these criteria:\n- E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- Uses T, I, M, S (untested common letters).\n- No C, R, A, N.\n\n<guess>times</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning: Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all. E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: times -> Feedback: T(x), I(x), M(x), E(-), S(x)\nMeaning: Letters T, I, M, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in the 4th position (since we put E in the 4th and got ""-"").\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word contains E, but not in the 4th or 5th position. So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S. (all marked as absent)\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n1. Includes the letter E in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position.\n2. Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n3. Tries to test new common letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use letters not in the absent list. Common letters we haven\'t tested: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also know that E must be in the word, so we must include it.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 1: E _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ E _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ _ E _ _\n\nWe need to form valid words.\n\nSince E is the only known letter, we want to maximize information by including multiple new common letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words with E in position 1, 2, or 3, and without the forbidden letters.\n\nOption 1: E in position 1\n- Example: ""EBONY"" -> E, B, O, N, Y -> but N is absent? We cannot use N. \n- How about ""ELOPE""? But L, O, P, E -> but E is at the end? Actually, E-L-O-P-E: the first E is position 1, last E is position 5. But we know E cannot be in position 5, so if we use ""ELOPE"", we are putting E in position 1 and 5. Position 5 is forbidden because the first feedback told us E is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word that has E at the end. Thus, ""ELOPE"" is invalid because of the E at the end.\n\nWe must avoid having E in the 4th or 5th, but we can have it in 1,2,3 only.\n\nAnother word: ""EERIE"" -> but multiple E\'s, and has R? R is absent. And also the last E? We cannot have E at the end. Also, R is absent.\n\nHow about ""EJECT""? But J? and we have C? C is absent. Also, E in position 1 and 4? The word ""eject"": E(1), J(2), E(3), C(4), T(5) -> but C and T are absent? We cannot use C or T.\n\nSo discard.\n\nAnother: ""EPOXY"" -> E, P, O, X, Y -> but is X common? Maybe not. We can try. But valid? Yes, meaning a resin. Avoids forbidden letters? E, P, O, X, Y -> none of C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? So yes. But E is in position 1. That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we don\'t know about X? That\'s a rare letter. We might get less information.\n\nOption 2: E in position 2\n- Pattern: _ E _ _ _\n- We can have: ""LEMON"" -> L, E, M, O, N -> but M is absent? We cannot use M. Also N is absent. So no.\n- ""BELLE"" -> but double L and E at the end? We cannot have E at the end. Also, B,E,L,L,E -> positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at the end? So invalid.\n\nHow about ""DEVIL"" -> D, E, V, I, L? But we have I and L? I is absent? In guess 2, I was marked absent, so we cannot use I. So no.\n\n""HELLO"" -> H, E, L, L, O -> E in position 2. Letters: H, E, L, O -> avoids forbidden? H, L, O not used? And E is allowed. Also, we don\'t have C,R,A,N,T,I,M,S? H, L, O are new. So yes. But ""hello"" has two L\'s? That\'s acceptable since the word might have duplicates? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid duplicates.\n\nHowever, ""HELLO"" is a valid word.\n\nOption 3: E in position 3\n- Pattern: _ _ E _ _\n- Examples: ""OPERA"" -> O, P, E, R, A -> but R and A are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""AGILE"" -> but A, G, I, L, E -> A and I are absent? Cannot use.\n- ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> T is absent? Cannot use T.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> N absent? Cannot use.\n\nHow about ""BOXED"" -> B, O, X, E, D -> E in position 4? No, B-O-X-E-D: E is the 4th? But we cannot have E in the 4th? Because in guess 2, times, E was at 4th and got ""-"", meaning not in 4th? But note: feedback for guess 2 says E(-) for the 4th position? Actually, in the word ""times"", E was the 4th letter and got a ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we cannot put E in the 4th? Or we can? But it won\'t be correct. We can put it but we know it will be \'-\' if it\'s not in the 4th? Actually, we can put E anywhere to test? But we already know E is not in the 4th or 5th. So for positions 1,2,3, we can test.\n\nIn this case, for position 3, we need the third letter to be E.\n\nLet\'s find a word: ""BELLE"" was considered, but E at the end.\n\n""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> C and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> I is absent? Cannot use I.\n\n""BUYER"" -> B, U, Y, E, R -> R is absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo it\'s getting hard.\n\nBack to E in position 1 or 2.\n\nEarlier, we had two candidates:\n- E in position 1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\n- E in position 2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\n\nAlso other possibilities?\n\nHow about E in position 1: ""EQUAL"" -> E, Q, U, A, L -> A is absent? Cannot use A.\n\n""EKING"" -> E, K, I, N, G -> I and N absent? Cannot use.\n\n""EDGED"" -> E, D, G, E, D -> but E at the end? Actually, positions: E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4), D(5). So E at the end? No, the 5th letter is D? Wait, E-D-G-E-D: so E at positions 1 and 4. Now, we know E is not in the 4th? Because guess2 proved that. So we cannot have E in the 4th? Actually, we can include E at 4th, but it would give \'-\' meaning present but not at 4th? Or if it were at 4th, it would be \'check\'. But the feedback from guess2 stated E in 4th gave \'-\' meaning E is in the word, but not in that position. So E is somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, having E in the 4th again would be redundant? But we can do, but it won\'t be correct. Since we know E is not in the 4th or 5th, we avoid putting E there to save positions? Actually, if we put E in the 4th again, we get \'-\' and we learn nothing new. So we should put E only in positions 1,2,3.\n\nIn ""EDGED"": E at position 1 and 4? So position 4 is forbidden? And also, the word has two E\'s? But the secret word has only one E? We don\'t know. It might have two E\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose words without duplicate letters? But not necessary.\n\nLet me find words with E in position 1 and other positions acceptable? Avoid E in 4th and 5th.\n\nSo for ""E _ _ _ _"" with no E at 4th or 5th.\n\nAnother word: ""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> avoids forbidden? E is at 1, and letters L, B, O, W are new. So yes. And no E in the end.\n\n""ELBOW"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, E in position 2: ""FELLA"" -> F, E, L, L, A -> but A is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""HELIX"" -> H, E, L, I, X -> I is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""JELLY"" -> J, E, L, L, Y -> E at position 2? Yes. Letters: J, E, L, Y -> avoids forbidden? J is not common, but L and Y are. But we can use.\n\nBut we also have ""HELLO"" which we considered.\n\nAnother: ""METAL"" -> M, E, T, A, L -> M, T, A are all absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo back to:\nOption E1: ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W)\nOption E2: ""HELLO"" (H, E, L, L, O)\nOption E1: ""EPOXY"" (E, P, O, X, Y)\nOption E1: ""EBONY"" -> but N is absent? We cannot use N.\n\nWe must avoid N.\n\nSo ""EBONY"" is invalid.\n\nAnother E in position 1: ""EBOOK""? Not common word? Or is it accepted? But ""ebook"" might not be in word list? Let\'s assume we stick to common words.\n\nSo candidates: ""ELBOW"", ""HELLO"", ""EPOXY""\n\nNow compare:\n- ""ELBOW"": E in pos1, letters: L, B, O, W -> all new and common except maybe W? But B and O are very common.\n- ""HELLO"": E in pos2, letters: H, L, L, O -> L repeated? H and O. H is somewhat common.\n- ""EPOXY"": E in pos1, letters: P, O, X, Y -> X is rare.\n\nWe want to test common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nThe most common letters left are: O, L, D, U, P, B, G, H, etc.\n\nTherefore, using O and L in the same word is good? So ""HELLO"" tests H, L, O. But we have two L\'s? Actually, in ""HELLO"", there are two L\'s? Positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). So we are testing L at positions 3 and 4? That might be efficient? We learn about L.\n\nSimilarly, ""ELBOW"" tests L, B, O, W.\n\n""ELBOW"" has more unique letters: E, L, B, O, W -> all distinct? Yes.\n\n""HELLO"" has H, E, L, L, O -> distinct: H,E,L,O (but L repeated).\n\nSo for information, ""ELBOW"" tests 5 unique letters? Actually E is already known, so it tests L, B, O, W, plus E.\n\nBut E position is different.\n\nWe know E must be present, but we don\'t know the position. In ""ELBOW"", we put E in position 1. If we get a ✓ for E in position 1, then we know E is at the start. If not, we get \'-\' meaning E is present but not here, so we know E is not in position 1, so it must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, for ""HELLO"", E in position 2: if we get ✓ for position 2, E is correct? If \'-\', then E is in another position? But we have only position 1 and 3 left? Positions: 1,2,3.\n\nBut we are also covering other letters.\n\nI think ""ELBOW"" is a good choice because it introduces B which is common, and avoids duplication.\n\nLet me confirm if there are better words.\n\nAnother possibility: E in position 3: ""BOGEY"" -> B, O, G, E, Y -> E in position 4? B-O-G-E-Y: E is the 4th? We cannot put E in the 4th? Because we know E is not in position 4.\n\n""BOGEY"" has E in the 4th? So we avoid.\n\n""AXLED""?: Not common.\n\n""UGLED""? Not common.\n\nSo sticking with E at 1 or 2.\n\nAnother word: ""EPOCH"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> but C is absent? Cannot use.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ELBOW"".\n\nGuess: ""ELBOW""\n\nIn this guess, we test E at position 1, and L, B, O, W at other positions.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on each.\n\nSo response format:\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): C, R, A, N are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 5th position (-).\n- From Guess 2 (""times""): T, I, M, S are absent (x), and E is present but not in the 4th position (-).\n\nKey insights:\n- E must be in the secret word and can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).\n- Absent letters to avoid: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S.\n- The new guess must include E in position 1, 2, or 3 and introduce new common letters to maximize information.\n\nStrategy:\n- Choose a word with E in position 1 to test if it might be the correct starting letter. If not, the feedback will confirm if E is not in position 1.\n- Use new common letters like L, B, O, W to cover frequent letters efficiently.\n- Avoid E in positions 4–5 and all absent letters.\n\nSelected guess: ""ELBOW""\n- E in position 1: Tests if E is the first letter. If feedback shows E(-), it would confirm E is in position 2 or 3.\n- New letters: L, B, O, W are all common and untested, helping to identify their presence/absence.\n- Valid 5-letter word without using any absent letters.\n\n<guess>elbow</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We\'ve had three guesses so far:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n- Meaning: E is in the word but in the wrong position (not in position 5).

T, I, M, S are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: elbow -> Feedback: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\n- Meaning: \n  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (we placed it at position 1 and got \'-\')\n  - L is in the word but not in position 2 (we placed it at position 2 and got \'-\')\n  - B, O, W are not in the word.\n\nSo from all the feedback:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W. \nThat is, the secret word does NOT contain: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.\n\nPresent letters (but position unknown): E and L.\n\nWe know E must be in the word, but we have now ruled out positions 1 (from elbow), 4 (from times), and 5 (from crane). So E must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, L must be in the word, and we placed it at position 2 in elbow and got \'-\', so L is not in position 2. Thus L is in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: We don\'t have a letter at position 1 yet? We placed E at position 1 and it was wrong, but we haven\'t tested other letters at position 1. However, we know L is present and can be at position 1? Or elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we know the word has at least two letters: E and L. Since we have five positions, there are three more letters to find.\n\nWe have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess).\n\nWe need to include both E and L in the next guess, and we have restrictions on their positions:\n\n- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it can\'t be at 1,4,5).\n- L cannot be in position 2 (we tried that) but can be in 1,3,4,5.\n\nWe also must avoid the absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z, and also we know E and L must be in.\n\nWe need a word that has E in position 2 or 3 and L in any position except 2? Actually, we can put L in position 2 again? But we know it\'s not in position 2, so if we put it there again, we\'ll get \'-\' again? That wouldn\'t help. So we should avoid position 2 for L? Actually, we can, but it\'s inefficient. So let\'s put L in a position we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, for E, we know it is in the word and must be at position 2 or 3. So we should try E at position 2 or 3?\n\nBut we don\'t know which. So we can put E at either position 2 or 3 in this guess? And L at a new position.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n\n- If we put E at position 2, then we can try L at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But we avoid position 2 for L.\n\n- Similarly, if we put E at position 3, same idea.\n\nWe have no constraint that E and L are the same letter? They are different.\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word that:\n\n- Has E at position 2 or 3.\n- Has L at any of positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2).\n\nHowever, if we put E and L at the same position? That is impossible since they are different. So we have to assign them to different positions.\n\nAlso, we must have a valid word.\n\nNow, we have to choose between position 2 or 3 for E? Since we don\'t know, we might pick one arbitrarily? Or pick a word that allows other letters to be tested.\n\nLet me think of words with E at position 2 or 3 and L elsewhere.\n\nFirst, E at position 2: pattern _ E _ _ _\n\nWe need L in any of the other positions (1,3,4,5) but position 1 is available? Wait, the pattern has position 1 as the first blank? So for E at position 2, we have:\n\nPosition 1: must be a letter that can form a word, and not forbidden (so from the available set).\nPosition 3: cannot be L if we put E at position 2? But we can put L here? Actually, position 3 is available.\n\nExample words:\n\n- If L is at position 3: _ E L _ _ -> e.g., ""HELLO""? But we know O is absent? Also, H might be available? But we haven\'t tested H. However, we avoided O? We know O is absent? From elbow, O is absent? Yes, O(x) in elbow.\n\nSo ""HELLO"" is invalid because of O.\n\n- L at position 4: _ E _ L _ \n  - Words: ? Let me think: ""FELL""? Too short? ""LEERY""? L at position 1? \n\nBut we have E in position 2? So if L is at position 4: then word must be something like X E Y L Z.\n\nWhat words? For example:\n  - ""LEVEL"": L at position 1 and 4? Also, E at position 2 and 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? And also, V and E? But double E? \n\n""LEVEL"": positions: L(1), E(2), V(3), E(4), L(5). But E is at position 2? And also at position 4? But we know E is not at position 4? Because of times guess? So we cannot have E at position 4. So if we put E at position 4, it would be incorrect? So ""level"" has E at positions 2,4, which conflicts? But we can use? However, we don\'t know how many E\'s? Only that E exists? So it might have multiple.\n\nBut for this pattern: _ E _ L _\n\n  - How about ""DEVIL""? But D, E, V, I, L -> I is absent? Cannot use I.\n\n  - ""JEHUI""? Not a word.\n\n  - ""PENAL""? But P, E, N, A, L -> A and N are absent? Cannot use.\n\nIt\'s hard.\n\nE at position 2 with L at position 5: _ E _ _ L\n\nWords: ""LEVEL"" again? But that has L at the end? And at the beginning? But E at position 2? So L at position 5? Then word? ""REBEL"": R is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""VEXEL"" Not a common word.\n\nAlternative: E at position 3: pattern _ _ E _ _\n\nThen we can put L at position 1, 4, or 5? Not position 2? But we can put L at position 3? But E is at position 3? Then conflict? They are different letters? So L cannot be at position 3 if E is there.\n\nSo L must be at 1,4,5.\n\nExample: L at position 1: L _ E _ _ \n\nWords? ""LIVED""? I is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEPER""? L, E, P, E, R -> R absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LUCKY""? But U,C,K -> C is absent? Cannot use.\n\nOr L at position 4: _ _ E L _\n\nWords: ""QUELL"": Q, U, E, L, L -> Q and U are available? We haven\'t tested them? But also, two L\'s? So positions: Q(1)? U(2)? E(3)? L(4)? L(5)? \n\nBut E is at position 3? That is allowed? And L at positions 4 and 5?\n\n""QUELL"": letters Q, U, E, L -> avoids forbidden? And E in position 3? L in 4 and 5? But we have to check if Q, U are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, L at position 5: _ _ E _ L\n\nWords: ""FUGUE""? F, U, G, U, E -> U repeated? And L is not? Not matching the pattern? We need L at the end? So ""TRAIL"" -> T and R absent? Cannot use.\n\n""FILED"" -> F,I,L,E,D -> I absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo one possibility: ""QUELL""\n\nBut let\'s see:\n\nPattern: _ _ E L L ? Or wait: ""QUELL"": Q(1), U(2), E(3), L(4), L(5)? Actually, the word would be Q-U-E-L-L? So L at the end? Yes.\n\nSo letters: Q, U, E, L, L -> so two L\'s? That\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we know L is present, so it might be duplicated? We don\'t know.\n\nAlso, E is at position 3? Which is allowed? And we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 2? So we can test new letters Q, U.\n\nIs ""QUELL"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""to extinguish or put an end to"".\n\nBut Q and U are less common? However, it fits the constraints.\n\nAnother option: E at position 2? With L at position 4? We were struggling.\n\nE at position 3 with L at position 1: ""LEDGE""? L, E, D, G, E -> E at position 2 and 5? But E at position 5 is forbidden? We know E cannot be at position 5? And also, we don\'t know about E duplication? So in ""ledge"": E at positions 2 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed? So invalid? Because we cannot have E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid? Per guess1? So we cannot use any word with E in the 5th position? Therefore, we must avoid E at the end.\n\nSimilarly, for L: we can have L at the end? Provided the secret word could have L there? Yes.\n\nBut E cannot be in the end.\n\nTherefore, for E at position 3 and L at position 1? We have: L _ E _ _\n\nBut then the last two letters cannot be E? So they must be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""LEGAL""? L, E, G, A, L -> A absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEVEE"" -> L, E, V, E, E -> ends with E? So invalid.\n\n""DEUCE"" -> D, E, U, C, E -> C absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo maybe difficult? And E at position 3? And L at 4? Like ""QUEL"" in ""QUELL""? Or another word? How about ""JOULE""? J, O, U, L, E -> O is absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo ""QUELL"" seems one option? But Q and U might not be common? But we don\'t have many choices.\n\nAnother word: E at position 3? And L at position 4: _ _ E L _\n\nWords: \n  - ""FUZIL""? Not a word? \n  - ""HAZEL"": H, A, Z, E, L -> A absent? Cannot use.\n  - ""GAZEL"": Not common.\n\nHow about without L? But we have to include L because it\'s present? We cannot leave L out? Actually, we must include L? No. We know L is present? Actually, the feedback tells us L is present? Yes, from elbow? We got L(-) so L is in the word? So we must include L in the guess? Or we can choose not? But if we don\'t include L, we won\'t get information about its position? So it\'s better to include? Since we know it is present? Actually, the rules don\'t require us to include every present letter? But if we want to find the position, we need to place it somewhere? But we don\'t have to?\n\nIn the game, we can guess words without L? But then we get feedback? For example, we might get a \'-\' for L? No? Because if we don\'t put any L, then we don\'t get feedback? Actually, we would get the letters we guessed? And if L is in the word but we didn\'t guess it, we won\'t know.\n\nHowever, since we are restricted in letters? We know we must place E and L? Because we know that E and L are present? So not including them is inefficient? Because we would have to guess them later? So we should include both present letters? For example, E and L.\n\nThus, we must include both E and L in the word? So the guess should contain both.\n\nTherefore, ""QUELL"" satisfies: it contains E (at position 3) and L (at positions 4 and 5? Actually, one L at position 4? The word has two L\'s? So positions: E at 3, L at 4 and 5? Or we consider one instance? But the word ""QUELL"": Q at1, U at2, E at3, L at4, L at5? So we are putting L at 4 and 5? So we test:\n\n- Position 1: Q -> new\n- Position 2: U -> new\n- Position 3: E -> we put E at position 3? Which is acceptable? Because we know E can be at position 3? \n- Position 4: L -> test L at position 4? \n- Position 5: L -> also L at position 5? \n\nThen we get feedback? For L at position 4 and 5? We might get a \'-\' for each? Or one might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we avoid forbidden letters.\n\nAnother possibility: E at position 2? And L at position 1? Pattern: L E _ _ _\n\nBut then E is at 2? Acceptable? This! We can have L at position 1? And E at position 2? Then pattern: L E _ _ _\n\nBut then we must fill three positions? And avoid E at the end? So the last letter cannot be E.\n\nWords: ""LEKKED"" is 6 letters? No.\n\n""LEAKY"": L, E, A, K, Y -> A is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""LEGGY"": L, E, G, G, Y -> avoids absent? What absent: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? This: G and Y? G not tested? Yes. So valid? But ends with Y? No E? So okay.\n\nBut we have double G? That\'s fine.\n\nBut position 3 and 4 are both G? Actually: L, E, G, G, Y? Positions: L(1),E(2),G(3),G(4),Y(5). So E at position 2? L at position 1? And no E at the end? Also, avoid forbidden letters? Check: no A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? So G and Y are allowed? Yes.\n\nIs ""LEGGY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning ""having attractively slim legs""? Not the most beautiful, but in a word game, it should be acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, we have other words? Like ""LEFGY"" not a word.\n\nSo ""LEGGY"" is possible?\n\nBut we also can have: ""LEUDY"" not common? ""LEYED"" not common.\n\n""LEGGY"" is common enough? Perhaps.\n\nWith E at position 2 and L at position 3: but E at position 2? Then L at position 3? Pattern: x E L y z? But E cannot be at position 2 if L is at position 3? Actually, we can? So: _ E L _ _\n\nWords: ""YELPT"" -> Y, E, L, P, T -> T is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""VELUM"" -> V, E, L, U, M? M is absent? Cannot use.\n\n""KELEP"" -> not common.\n\n""HELIM"" not? \n\nSo difficult.\n\nTherefore, two strong candidates: ""QUELL"" and ""LEGGY""\n\nLet\'s compare:\n\n""QUELL"": \n   - E at position 3? So if E is at position 3, we get a check? If not, we get \'-\' meaning E is at position 2? But we know E can only be at position 2 or 3? So if we use ""QUELL"" we are placing E at position 3? If we get E (check), then position 3 is correct? If not, then E must be at position 2? And we get \'-\' for E meaning not at position 3? But in that case, it must be at position 2? So one guess will determine the exact position of E? Nice.\n\nSimilarly, we also test L at positions 4 and 5? But we don\'t know if L is at both positions? We are putting two L\'s? But the feedback might tell us? For position 4: if L is actually at position 4, we get a check? If not and it\'s at position 5? We get a minus for position 4 and check for position 5? Or if L is elsewhere, we get \'-\' for both? We also test Q and U.\n\n""LEGGY"": \n   - E is at position 2? So if we get E (check) for position 2, good? If not, it must be position 3? Since can\'t be elsewhere? So similar? Also, we test L at position 1? So if L is at position 1, we get a check? Or \'-\' if not? But we know L is not at position 2? But other positions available?\n\nIn ""LEGGY"": \n   - Position 1: L -> tests if L is at start? \n   - Position 2: E -> tests if E is at position 2?\n   - Position 3: G -> tests G at position 3? New letter.\n   - Position 4: G -> tests G at position 4? We put a repeated G? But G might not be duplicated? So we test Position 5: Y -> new.\n\nSo both guesses are viable.\n\nBut let me choose the one that uses more common letters? G and Y are more common than Q and U? So ""LEGGY"" might be better? Because Q and U are less common? But actually, Q is rare? Yes.\n\nAdditionally, with ""LEGGY"", we test the possibility of L at position 1? Which is important? And E at position 2? If not, then E must be at position 3? And L must be in position 4 or 5? Etc.\n\nTherefore, ""LEGGY"" is preferred?\n\nBut also, ""LEGGY"" has no duplicate letters? In terms of distinct letters? It has L, E, G, G, Y? So two G\'s? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut we can also consider: we haven\'t used F, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, X, Y, Z, etc? G and Y are common letters? U is common too? But Q is less common.\n\nAnother word: E at position 3 and L at position 1? But we had ""LEG"" + something? ""LEPRO""? L, E, P, R, O? But O and R absent? Cannot use.\n\nSo we go with ""LEGGY"" for its common letters.\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters? In ""LEGGY"", G and Y are not in the absent list? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we choose ""LEGGY"".\n\nLet me write the pattern: L(1), E(2), G(3), G(4), Y(5).\n\nThen feedback will tell us:\n\n- If E is at position 2, we get check at position 2? Else minus.\n\n- If L is at position 1, we get check? Else minus? But we know L is present? So if minus at position 1, then L must be in position 3,4, or 5? But we put L only at position 1? And G and Y elsewhere? So if L is in position 3,4, or 5, we get minuses for them? But we don\'t have L at positions 3,4, or 5? Only at position 1? So for the other positions, we have G and Y? Which might be absent? \n\nWe are not putting L at other positions? So we indirectly infer? Actually, for L, if we put it at position 1 and get a \'-\', that means L is in the word but not at position 1? And similarly for E? If E at position 2 gives \'-\' then L must be at position 3? Etc.\n\nBut it\'s fine.\n\nI think ""LEGGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo guess: ""LEGGY""\n\nBut let me double-check spelling: LEGGY is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we return ""LEGGY"".After analyzing the feedback from all guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, T, I, M, S, B, O, W (marked with `x` in feedback). These cannot appear in the secret word.\n- **Present letters**: E and L (marked with `-` in feedback), confirming they are in the word but in the wrong positions tested so far.\n- **E position constraints**: E is not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (ruled out by guesses 1–3), so E must be in position 2 or 3.\n- **L position constraints**: L is not in position 2 (ruled out by guess 3), so L must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since E and L occupy different positions, L cannot be where E is placed.\n\nThe new guess must:\n1. Include both E and L (known present letters).\n2. Place E in position 2 or 3.\n3. Place L in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2, and ensuring it doesn\'t conflict with E).\n4. Use only untested letters from the available pool: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (since absent letters are excluded).\n5. Form a valid English word.\n\nGiven E must be in position 2 or 3, placing E in position 2 is prioritized to test its placement early. L is placed in position 1 to test a new position efficiently. The word ""LEGGY"" fits:\n- Position 1: L (tests if L is correct here).\n- Position 2: E (tests if E is correct here).\n- Positions 3–4: G (repeated letter, tests G presence/position).\n- Position 5: Y (tests Y presence).\n- Avoids absent letters and includes E/L as required.\n\nUsing ""LEGGY"" maximizes information:\n- Determines E\'s position: if E gets `✓` in position 2, it\'s confirmed; if `-`, E must be in position 3.\n- Tests L in position 1.\n- Introduces common untested letters G and Y.\n\n<guess>leggy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: times -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: elbow -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)\nGuess 4: leggy -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have received feedback from Guess 4: ""leggy"" -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n\nBreaking it down:\n- L(-): The letter L is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since we put it in position 1).\n- E(✓): The letter E is in the correct position (position 2). So the secret word has E as the second letter.\n- G(x): The letter G is NOT in the word. Since we have two G\'s and both got (x), G is not in the secret word at all.\n- Y(✓): The letter Y is in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with Y.\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- Position 2 is E (fixed).\n- Position 5 is Y (fixed).\n- The letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1, and not in position 2 (since that\'s E) or position 5 (Y). So L must be in position 3 or position 4.\n- The word does NOT contain G (and also all previously absent letters: A,B,C,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W).\n\nAdditionally, we know E is at position 2 and Y at position 5, and L is present, so the remaining positions to fill are 1, 3, and 4? Actually, let\'s list the positions:\n- Position 1: unknown (but cannot be L? because we know L is not here? Actually, we only know that L is not at position 1? But L could be at position 3 or 4).\n- Position 2: E (known)\n- Position 3: unknown\n- Position 4: unknown\n- Position 5: Y (known).\n\nBut we also know L must be in position 3 or 4? So the word looks like: _ E _ _ Y, and either position 3 or 4 must be L? And the other position is another letter? Also, position 1 is a letter.\n\nMoreover, we have the letter L that must be placed, and it\'s not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So:\n\nPattern: ? E (L or ?) (L or ?) Y\n\nBut we cannot have L in both positions? Or we can? The word might have duplicate L? But we only know L is present? So possibly duplicated? But we haven\'t seen evidence? So it might be.\n\nBut we don\'t know? So we must consider that L could be at position 3 and/or position 4? Or only one of them?\n\nSince we have only one L marked present? But in previous feedback? From guess 3 (elbow): L was marked \'-\' meaning it is present but not at position 2? And we had one L? Then in guess4: L was at position 1 and marked \'-\' meaning present but not at position 1? So we know there is at least one L? And it must be at position 3 or 4? Or both? But we cannot tell? So we should test a word that places L in one of these positions? And see? Or a word that has L only in one? To avoid confusion.\n\nAlso, we know the absent letters: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And from guess2 and guess1? So the forbidden letters are: A,B,C,G,I,M,N,O,R,S,T,W? And also B,O,W from guess3? Yes.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, and we have E and Y fixed? But we know E and Y? So when forming words, we can include only letters from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z, plus L? And L must be present? So the words must include L? And have E at position 2 and Y at position 5.\n\nThus, the word must match: _ E _ _ Y, with position 3 or 4 (or both) being L? But not necessarily? L must be somewhere? But it could be at position 1? But no? We know L is not at position 1? So it must be at position 3 or 4? So actually, one of position 3 or 4 must be L? Or both? But we don\'t know. So we must choose a word that has L at either position 3 or position 4? And the other positions? Position 1 can be any available letter? And the other position (if not L) also?\n\nFor example:\n- If L is at position 3: then word is: _ E L _ Y\n- If L is at position 4: then word is: _ E _ L Y\n\nAnd the blank positions? One is position 1? The other is the remaining position? For the first case: positions 4 is to fill? And position 1? Similarly for the second case?\n\nWe have to form valid English words? So we need to find words that fit one of these patterns? Or have L in position 3 or 4? But since we don\'t know, we must choose a word for one of the cases? And then we will learn? Because after this guess, we get feedback? For example, if we put L in position 3 and it is correct, we get a check? Else if present but wrong position, we get \'-\', etc.? So we can decide to test position 3 or position 4?\n\nBut we need to choose a word? So we pick one possibility? Or pick a word that works for either? We have to guess a word? So we choose a word that has L at position 3? Or at position 4? And also fill the other blanks with common letters.\n\nMoreover, since we have very few letters available? Let\'s list all possible words that fit:\n\nFirst pattern: _ E L _ Y\n\nWe need to fill position 1 and position 4?\n\nPosition 4? It must be a letter? And position 1 a letter? From available letters? Without the forbidden ones.\n\nAlso, the word must include L? Which is already at position 3? So we have that? Now, we need to find a valid word: some letters at position 1 and position 4? From: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z? And remember, the letter we choose must form a word? Also, the word must have E and L? And Y? Which we have? So let\'s think:\n\nWords: \n- ""KELLY""? K, E, L, L, Y? But double L? And position 1: K? Position 4: L? So yes? Then the word would be K E L L Y? That spells ""KELLY""? Is that a word? Yes, a name? But in Wordle, names? Usually allow common names? Or just dictionary? But ""Kelly"" is both? And it fits: K(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5). Also, avoids forbidden? Letters K, L? L we are using? E and Y? So forbidden? No forbidden letters? And L is duplicated? That\'s acceptable.\n\nBut note: in feedback? For guess4? We had Y(✓) at position 5, so Y is fixed? And E(✓) at position 2? So ""KELLY"" has E at 2? And Y at 5? And L at positions 3 and 4? So it includes L in both positions? So if the secret word is ""KELLY""? Then we get all correct? But we don\'t know yet? But we can guess it? If it is, we win.\n\nOther words: ""DAILY""? D, A, I, L, Y? But A and I are absent? Cannot use.\n\n""HELPY""? Not common? \n\n""JELLY""? J, E, L, L, Y? Same as Kelly? Only different first letter? J? So ""JELLY"" -> J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? Valid? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""FELLY""? Not common? Or ""felly"" is a word? Perhaps.\n\nAnother: ""VELLY""? Not common.\n\nAlso: ""DELI Y""? Not? We need position 4 to be something? If only one L? Then position 4? For example, ""DELAY""? D, E, L, A, Y? But A absent? Cannot.\n\n""HELPY"" is not in dictionary? \n\nHow about ""BELLY""? B, E, L, L, Y? But B is absent? From elbow? We had B(x)? So cannot use B.\n\nSimilarly, ""PELLY""? Not common.\n\nBut JELLY or KELLY seem good? And FILLY? But I is absent? Cannot.\n\nSecond pattern: _ E _ L Y\n\nSo word: ? E ? L Y\n\nThen we need position 1 and position 3? For example:\n\n""FEU L Y""? Not? ""Felly""? ""Felly"" is the rim of a wheel? Valid? But F, E, L, L, Y? So positions: F(1), E(2), L(3? But no? Pattern _ E _ L Y -> position 1: ? position 3: ? position 4: L? So for example: \n- Position 1: D? Position 3: U? Then ""DEULY""? Not a word.\n- Better: ""DEVLY""? Not.\n\n""PEILY""? Not.\n\nSo it seems that the pattern with L in position 3 and 4 like JELLY or KELLY might be the only options? Or words like ""DELHY"" not.\n\nWhat about ""JOLEDY""? No? \n\nConsidering both patterns, words like KELLY or JELLY fit the first pattern: _ E L L Y? With position 3=L and position 4=L? So double L.\n\nBut we know L is present? And we don\'t know if duplicated? But KELLY and JELLY are valid? So we can choose one? They differ only in the first letter? K or J.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe must pick one? Or since we have E and Y fixed? And then L at positions? Both K and J are equally likely? Based on letter frequency, K is more common? But J is less common? But let\'s pick ""JELLY"" because J is less frequent? Or we already have J untested? Same as K.\n\nTo cover more possibilities? But if we choose JELLY and it\'s not, we learn about J? Similarly for KELLY? We learn about K.\n\nAlso, note: in position 1? It can be any letter? So there might be other possibilities? For example, if L is only at one position? Say position 3? But then we need a word like: _ E L ? Y? Where position 4 is not L? So ? E L ? Y? But we have to fill position 1 and position 4? With available letters? And form a word.\n\nFor example: \n- ""HEL M Y""? Not.\n- ""HELP Y""? Not? We need one letter? ""HELPY"" is not a word.\n- ""HOMEY""? But O absent? Cannot.\n- ""FISHY""? F, I, S, H, Y? I and S absent? Cannot.\n\nPerhaps ""PEDLY""? Not common.\n\nOr ""VEDLY"" not.\n\nTherefore, maybe the only common words are with double L? At positions 3 and 4? So ""KELLY"" and ""JELLY"" are both valid? Also ""FELLY""? But F is available? ""FELLY"" meaning the edge of a box? Or something? But it\'s less common than JELLY? So JELLY and KELLY are better.\n\nAlso, ""TELLY"" for television? But T is absent? Cannot.\n\nTherefore, we choose between JELLY and KELLY?\n\nBut we have only two guesses left? And we have used 4? So this is guess 5? And we have one more after this? So we can try one? And if we are wrong, the next one? But we want to maximize efficiency? So perhaps chose one that also tests common letters? But K and J? Both are uncommon? J is least common? So if we choose JELLY and J is absent, we later know? Similarly?\n\nBut let\'s list the remaining possible words? Actually, the secret word must have E at position 2 and Y at position 5? And L at position 3 or 4? Or both? And the first letter must be one from D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.\n\nIf the word has two L\'s? Then it must be: ? E L L Y? With the first letter allowed? So: JELLY? KELLY? FELLY? PELLY? VEILY? Not? Only few: like DELIY not? So only with double L? Probably the common ones are JELLY, KELLY? And FELLY? But less common? ZELLY not? Etc.\n\nIf the word has L only at position 3? Then ? E L ? Y? Position 4? Must be a letter? From available? And the word must be valid? \n\nPossible: \n- ""HELVY"" not a word?\n- ""DELVY""? Not?\n- ""KELPY"": K, E, L, P, Y? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of seaweed? So ""KELPY"" -> K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So positions: E at2, Y at5, L at position3? And no L at position4? So it fits? And P is available? And K? Not forbidden? So KELPY is a valid word? Also, KELP is a word? KELPY? Kelp is a kelpy? Actually, ""kelpy"" is listed in dictionaries? We are to assume it\'s valid? Similarly.\n\nAnother: ""JELPY""? Not common? But ""JELPY"" might not be a word? Only KELPY?\n\nSimilarly, other possibilities like ""HELPY"" not.\n\nOr ""VELVY"" not common.\n\nOr ""DEV I Y"" not? \n\nBut with L at position4? Pattern ? E ? L Y? Then words: \n- ""EXILY"" not? \n- ""AUSLY"" not?\n- Perhaps ""PULLY""? But U? And L? But ""PULLY"": P, U, L, L, Y? So U? Y? But pattern: P(1),E(2),? Position3? But if position3? We need? E at2? Position3? Then L at4? So like P E V L Y? Not a word? Or ""BYLLY"" not? \n\nSo only real possibilities: \n- Double L: JELLY, KELLY, FELLY, PELLY, etc? but only JELLY and KELLY are common? And FELLY? And PELLY? Not as common? Perhaps KELPY? Which has one L? \n\nSo possible words: KELLY, JELLY, KELPY, etc? \n\nWe need to include L? And we know L is present? So for KELPY? It has L? So it\'s possible? And also, other possibilities? Like KELPY where L is at position3? No? In KELPY, L is at position3? And position4 is P? \n\nSo to maximize information? We can guess a word that tests both possibilities? Or choose a word that covers common letters? Since we have limited options? \n\nBut if we guess KELLY? And it\'s not? Then we might get feedback? For example, if the word is KELPY? Then guessing KELLY? Positions: \n- Position1: K? If secret has K? Then? \n- Position2: E(✓) -> correct\n- Position3: L? In KELPY, L is also at3? So ✓? \n- Position4: L? But secret has P at position4? So minus? Because L is present? But not at position4? So L(-)? \n- Position5: Y(✓)\n\nBut then we know K? And we would know that L is not at position4? So we have two positions? And we know E and Y? And P? From the feedback? Also, we know from KELLY guess: the fourth letter is not L? So then the secret word must have L at position3? And position4? Must be? The letter we get from feedback? We can solve? But it\'s messy? Because we have only one guess left? \n\nBetter to guess a word that has L at only one position? So we can isolate? \n\nTherefore, let\'s guess KELPY? Which has L only at position3? And P at position4? \n\nIf we guess KELPY? And the secret word is KELPY? We win? \n\nIf not? We get feedback.\n\nAlso, KELPY uses K, P? Both not tested? \n\nGiven that, KELPY is a good candidate? \n\nBut we must? It avoids forbidden? Letters: K, E, L, P, Y? E and Y are known? K not tested? P not tested? L is present? So valid? \n\nTherefore, we choose ""KELPY""\n\nGuess: KELPY? \n\nBut let me confirm: positions? K(1),E(2),L(3),P(4),Y(5)? So pattern? And feedback: if correct? \n\nBut we don’t know if the secret word has L at position3? Or at position4? Or both? For KELPY, L at position3? \n\nThe other possibility is that L at position4? So ? E ? L Y? And the word? For example, what words have L at position4? ? E ? L Y? Like ""HEPLY"" not? ""VEXLY"" not? Etc? So probably KELPY is a good word? \n\nSo go with that.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""KELPY""\n\nResponse: <guess>kelpy</guess>We have specific confirmed letters and constraints:\n- Position 2: E (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).\n- Position 5: Y (confirmed with `✓` in guess 4).\n- L must be present but not in positions 1 or 2 (per `-` feedback from guesses 3 and 4) and cannot be in position 5 (since Y is fixed there), so L must be in position 3 or 4.\n- G is absent (`x` in guess 4).\n- Other absent letters: A, B, C, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W.\n\nThe secret word pattern is `_ E _ _ Y`, with the middle blank positions (position 3 or 4) containing L.\n\nTo maximize information with the 5th guess, ""KELPY"" is selected because:\n- It positions E and Y correctly (`position 2: E`, `position 5: Y`).\n- It places L in position 3 (testing one of the valid positions).\n- It introduces K (new letter) and P (new letter) to test their presence.\n- If ""KELPY"" is correct, we win immediately. If not, its feedback:\n  - Will clarify if L is in position 3 or 4.\n  - Will show if K or P are present/absent.\n- ""KELPY"" (meaning a type of seaweed) is a valid uncommon word but permitted word list in Wordle-style games.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down remaining possibilities for the final guess if needed.\n\n<guess>kelpy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)** → E is present but not in position 5.\n- **Guess 2: times → FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(-) S(x)** → E is present but not in position 4.\n- **Guess 3: elbow → FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) B(x) O(x) W(x)** → E is not in position 1, L is present but not in position 2, B/O/W are absent.\n- **Guess 4: leggy → FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(✓)** → E is confirmed at position 2, Y is confirmed at position 5, L is present but not in position 1, G is absent.\n\n**Known Constraints:**\n- **Fixed letters:** Position 2 is E, position 5 is Y.

We have feedback from Guess 5: ""kelpy"" -> FEEDBACK: K(x) E(✓) L(✓) P(x) Y(✓)

Breaking it down:
- K(x): K is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is correct and in position 2 (already known).
- L(✓): L is correct and in position 3 (so confirmed).
- P(x): P is not in the word.
- Y(✓): Y is correct and in position 5 (already known).

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: Y
- Position 1: Unknown letter (but K and P are absent, and we know other absent letters)
- Position 4: Unknown letter (but we know K and P are absent)

Also, from previous feedback, the absent letters are: 
A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W (from earlier guesses) and now K and P (from this guess). 

So absent: A, B, C, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, W

Available letters: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z

And we have positions:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: ? 
- Position 5: Y

The word pattern is: ? E L ? Y

We need to fill position 1 and position 4 with letters from the available set: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z

We need to form a valid English word? Only options:

- For position 1 and 4? Must form a 5-letter word with E, L, Y fixed.

Possible words:
- ""DELAY""? But A is absent? Cannot use.
- ""FELTY""? Not common? Probably not valid? But also T absent? T was absent? Yes, T absent? Wait, T is absent? So no.
- ""JULY""? Only 4 letters? No.

We need 5 letters? Let me list:

- Position 1 must be one letter? Position 4 another? From available.

Possible combinations:

For example:
- Position 1: D? Then position 4: ? Then word: D E L ? Y? So ? could be F, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z?

What words: ""DELF Y"" -> ""DELFY"" not a word? Or ""DELVY"" not?
""DELAY"" has A? Absent.

D E L U Y? -> ""DELUY"" not a word.

Similarly, D E L H Y? ""DELHY"" not.

With F: ""FELID""? F, E, L, I, D? I is absent? Cannot.

F E L U Y? Not a word.

Similarly, H: ""HEL V Y""? Not?

H E L D Y? ""HELDY"" not common? Not valid? 

H E L F Y? Not.

With J: ""JEL D Y""? Not.

""JEL U Y""? Not.

Q: ""QELP Y"" not? 

U: ""UEL"" -> position1 U? Then U E L ? Y? So ? position4: D, F, H, etc? ""UELY"" not? ""UELV"" not? 

V: ""VEL D Y"" -> ""VELDY"" not a word? 

X: ""XEL"" words? ""XELHA""? Not? 

Z: ""ZELDA""? Only 5 letters? Z,E,L,D,A? But A is absent? Cannot use.

So few? Let me try to think of any valid English word that fits ? E L ? Y? With the available letters.

Another word: ""FLEW Y""? Flew is 4? Not 5? And W is absent? Cannot.

Or ""BELIE""? But B and I absent? No.

Perhaps ""DELUXE"" too long? 

Wait, what about ""JELLY""? But we know? From guess4? We had G(x)? And JELLY? But earlier? Also, in guess5? We have P(x)? But JELLY does not have J? Position1?

JELLY: J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? But position4 is L? So we need ? E L ? Y? With position4? For ""JELLY"", position4 is L? So pattern: J E L L Y? So we have L at position3 and position4?

But from previous feedback? We have? Position4 is empty? So if we use ""JELLY"", then the word is J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)

So the pattern matches? And letter: J at position1? And L at position4?

Then we need to see if J is available? With available letters? D,F,H,J,Q,U,V,X,Z? J is available? And absent were I,K,M,N,O,P,R,S,T? So J is not absent.

Similarly, L is not in the list? But we are using L at position4? Does that conflict? We know L is present? And we have L at position3? So duplicated? That's acceptable? Yes.

Similarly? What about ""KELLY""? K is absent? So cannot.

Or ""FELLY""? But F? And E,L,L,Y? So F(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? F is still available? Not absent.

Yes? So ""FELLY""? Is that a word?

Felly: the rim of a wheel? Yes? Valid? Yes.

Therefore? Possible words for the secret word? Could be:

- J E L L Y? With J at 1? And L duplicated? 
- F E L L Y? With F at 1? 
- And others? But that's all? Since K is absent? So only F and J? 

Position4 must be L? So pattern: ? E L L Y? So words: F E L L Y and J E L L Y? And also? H? H E L L Y? ""HELLY"" not? Or? 

D E L L Y? ""DELLY"" slang? Not standard? Probably not? 

So probably FELLY and JELLY? Are the only common ones? But also? ""VELLY"" not? Etc? So we have two? 

Now? We have only one guess? Since this is the 6th guess? Guess5 was the fifth? So we have one left? Guess6.

We can choose either FELLY or JELLY? And hope? 

But how to choose? We don't? So we pick one? 

Since we guessed KELPY last? Which has P? But wrong? So guess5 was wrong? 

Therefore? For the final guess? We try one of the two? 

Also? Note: we haven't tested J or F? So we don't know? 

Previously? We didn't guess any word with these letters? So we have no information on F or J? 

Therefore? We can? The word must be one of FELLY or JELLY? 

So we choose JELLY? Because J is less common? And if we get feedback? But it's the last guess? If we choose incorrectly? We lose? So we must pick correctly? 

But since we don't know? We choose arbitrarily? 

However? In the pattern? Position4 is L? And we have FELLY and JELLY? 

But let me confirm? The word ""felly"" and ""jelly"" are both valid? 

Therefore? We guess one? I'll go with ""JELLY""

Guess: JELLY? 

But in the pattern? The word has L at positions 3 and 4? So if the secret word has L at position3 and position4? Then? 

Also? Remember? In guess4? We had L(-) for position1? So L is present? But not position1? And in guess5? We had L(✓) for position3? So L is at position3? Correct? But what about position4? We haven't tested? If the secret word has L at position4? Then? But if we put a letter at position4? It might be correct? 

In JELLY? position4 is L? So if the secret word is JELLY? Then position4 should be L? 

But we know L must be in position3 from guess5? Yes? So position3 is L? And position4 might be something else? 

In guess5? We used KELPY? Which has L at position3? And it got L(✓)? So the position3 is L? So correct? 

Then? Position4? In KELPY? We put P? And got P(x)? So position4 is not P? And not any other absent? 

So for the secret word? Position3: L? Position4: some letter? Not in absent? And in our pattern? Position4 must be filled? 

Therefore? The secret word pattern: ? E L ? Y? With position3 L? Position4 ? something? 

So we need to fill position1 and position4? 

And form a word? 

Possible words: 
- F E L L Y? Which has position4: L? So L duplicated? 
- J E L L Y? Same? 
- Or? Position4? With other letters? 

For example? What letter? From available? D? Then ""DEL L Y"" -> ""DELLY"" ? Not common? But valid in some contexts? 

U? ""UEL L Y"" not? 

V? ""VEL L Y"" not? 

H? ""HEL L Y"" -> ""HELLY"" not common? 

Q? Q E L L Y? ""QUELLY"" not? 

But F E L L Y and J E L L Y? Are valid? 

Also? ""DEVEL""? But not? 

Therefore? The only realistic options are FELLY and JELLY? 

So we guess one? 

Since we haven't guessed any J? While we guessed F? No? F not guessed? So both new? 

Therefore? I choose JELLY? 

But let me see? We must submit the guess? 

So guess ""JELLY""? 

Response: <guess>jelly</guess>? 

But also? Consider? Position1: if F? Then FELLY? If J? JELLY? 

So? 
</think>
**Conclusion from Previous Feedback:**  
Using all feedback, we know the secret word:  
- Must have `E` in position 2 (✓ from `leggy`).  
- Must have `L` in position 3 (✓ from `kelpy`).  
- Must have `Y` in position 5 (✓ from `leggy`).  
- `K` and `P` are absent (x from `kelpy`).  
- Combined with all earlier absent letters: **A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W**.  

This leaves the pattern: `? E L ? Y`.  
- **Position 1 options**: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z (available letters not absent).  
- **Position 4 options**: Must be a letter allowing a valid word. Only realistic words fitting this pattern with the constraints are `FELLY` (rim of a wheel) and `JELLY` (a gel-like substance).  

**Why `JELLY`?**  
- `J` is unused and less common than `F` (in `FELLY`), so testing `J` provides closure.  
- If `JELLY` is incorrect, the answer must be `FELLY`.  

Given this is the **final guess** (6th try), `JELLY` is selected as a valid choice.  

<guess>jelly</guess>",jelly,"We have feedback from Guess 5: ""kelpy"" -> FEEDBACK: K(x) E(✓) L(✓) P(x) Y(✓)

- L(✓): L is correct and in position 3 (so confirmed).
- P(x): P is not in the word.

But from previous feedback? We have? Position4 is empty? So if we use ""JELLY"", then the word is J(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)

So the pattern matches? And letter: J at position1? And L at position4?

Then we need to see if J is available? With available letters? D,F,H,J,Q,U,V,X,Z? J is available? And absent were I,K,M,N,O,P,R,S,T? So J is not absent.

Similarly, L is not in the list? But we are using L at position4? Does that conflict? We know L is present? And we have L at position3? So duplicated? That's acceptable? Yes.

Similarly? What about ""KELLY""? K is absent? So cannot.

Or ""FELLY""? But F? And E,L,L,Y? So F(1),E(2),L(3),L(4),Y(5)? F is still available? Not absent.

Yes? So ""FELLY""? Is that a word?

Felly: the rim of a wheel? Yes? Valid? Yes.

Therefore? Possible words for the secret word? Could be:

- J E L L Y? With J at 1? And L duplicated? 
- F E L L Y? With F at 1? 
- And others? But that's all? Since K is absent? So only F and J? 

Position4 must be L? So pattern: ? E L L Y? So words: F E L L Y and J E L L Y? And also? H? H E L L Y? ""HELLY"" not? Or? 

D E L L Y? ""DELLY"" slang? Not standard? Probably not? 

So probably FELLY and JELLY? Are the only common ones? But also? ""VELLY"" not? Etc? So we have two? 

Now? We have only one guess? Since this is the 6th guess? Guess5 was the fifth? So we have one left? Guess6.

We can choose either FELLY or JELLY? And hope? 

But how to choose? We don't? So we pick one? 

Since we guessed KELPY last? Which has P? But wrong? So guess5 was wrong? 

Therefore? For the final guess? We try one of the two? 

Also? Note: we haven't tested J or F? So we don't know? 

Previously? We didn't guess any word with these letters? So we have no information on F or J? 

Therefore? We can? The word must be one of FELLY or JELLY? 

So we choose JELLY? Because J is less common? And if we get feedback? But it's the last guess? If we choose incorrectly? We lose? So we must pick correctly? 

But since we don't know? We choose arbitrarily? 

However? In the pattern? Position4 is L? And we have FELLY and JELLY? 

But let me confirm? The word ""felly"" and ""jelly"" are both valid? 

Therefore? We guess one? I'll go with ""JELLY""

Guess: JELLY? 

But in the pattern? The word has L at positions 3 and 4? So if the secret word has L at position3 and position4? Then? 

Also? Remember? In guess4? We had L(-) for position1? So L is present? But not position1? And in guess5? We had L(✓) for position3? So L is at position3? Correct? But what about position4? We haven't tested? If the secret word has L at position4? Then? But if we put a letter at position4? It might be correct? 

In JELLY? position4 is L? So if the secret word is JELLY? Then position4 should be L? 

But we know L must be in position3 from guess5? Yes? So position3 is L? And position4 might be something else? 

In guess5? We used KELPY? Which has L at position3? And it got L(✓)? So the position3 is L? So correct? 

Then? Position4? In KELPY? We put P? And got P(x)? So position4 is not P? And not any other absent? 

So for the secret word? Position3: L? Position4: some letter? Not in absent? And in our pattern? Position4 must be filled? 

Therefore? The secret word pattern: ? E L ? Y? With position3 L? Position4 ? something? 

So we need to fill position1 and position4? 

And form a word? 

Possible words: 
- F E L L Y? Which has position4: L? So L duplicated? 
- J E L L Y? Same? 
- Or? Position4? With other letters? 

For example? What letter? From available? D? Then ""DEL L Y"" -> ""DELLY"" ? Not common? But valid in some contexts? 

U? ""UEL L Y"" not? 

V? ""VEL L Y"" not? 

H? ""HEL L Y"" -> ""HELLY"" not common? 

Q? Q E L L Y? ""QUELLY"" not? 

But F E L L Y and J E L L Y? Are valid? 

Also? ""DEVEL""? But not? 

Therefore? The only realistic options are FELLY and JELLY? 

So we guess one? 

Since we haven't guessed any J? While we guessed F? No? F not guessed? So both new? 

Therefore? I choose JELLY? 

But let me see? We must submit the guess? 

So guess ""JELLY""? 

Response: <guess>jelly</guess>? 

But also? Consider? Position1: if F? Then FELLY? If J? JELLY? 

So?**Conclusion from Previous Feedback:**  
Using all feedback, we know the secret word:  
- Must have `E` in position 2 (✓ from `leggy`).  
- Must have `L` in position 3 (✓ from `kelpy`).  
- Must have `Y` in position 5 (✓ from `leggy`).  
- `K` and `P` are absent (x from `kelpy`).  
- Combined with all earlier absent letters: **A, B, C, G, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, W**.  

This leaves the pattern: `? E L ? Y`.  
- **Position 1 options**: D, F, H, J, Q, U, V, X, Z (available letters not absent).  
- **Position 4 options**: Must be a letter allowing a valid word. Only realistic words fitting this pattern with the constraints are `FELLY` (rim of a wheel) and `JELLY` (a gel-like substance).  

**Why `JELLY`?**  
- `J` is unused and less common than `F` (in `FELLY`), so testing `J` provides closure.  
- If `JELLY` is incorrect, the answer must be `FELLY`.  

Given this is the **final guess** (6th try), `JELLY` is selected as a valid choice.",Guess 6: jelly -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) E(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
