We are starting the game. We don't have any prior feedback. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I choose a word that has common letters and 5 distinct letters: ""CRANE""

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE""
</think>
<thinking>
We are at the start of the game with no prior feedback. A strong first guess should maximize the information gained by covering common English letters. 
- The word should be 5 letters long and contain frequently used letters to increase the chance of matches.
- Avoiding repeated letters is beneficial to cover more distinct letters.

One excellent starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- These letters are among the most common in English words (A, E, R, C, N are all top 20% in frequency).
- If any letters match (✓ or -), it narrows down possibilities significantly.

Other alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" is a classic opening choice for word games.

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". 
  Specifically, A was in position 3 and E was in position 5 of ""CRANE"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes the letters A and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""CRANE"" (so A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- Avoids using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that contain A and E, avoid C, R, N, and place A and E in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for A: can be at 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for E: can be at 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We should also try to include other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with A and E and also S, T, etc.

For example:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E
  - A is at position 3? But in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in a new word, we can put A at a different position. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But we must avoid having A at position 3 because we know from feedback that A is not at position 3. So ""SLATE"" has A at position 3, which is invalid for our purpose? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't restrict our next guess. We can put A at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not correct. We should try A in a new position to get more information.

However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent us from guessing A at position 3 again, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try A in a different position.

Similarly for E: we know it's not at position 5, so we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, for our next guess, we should avoid:
- Position 3 for A
- Position 5 for E

Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N, and place A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Some ideas:

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E
  - A is at position 2 (not 3), E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our guess, we can put E at position 5? But that would be a position we know is wrong. We should avoid that to get new information. So better to put E at a different position.

We should try to put E in a position that is not 5. Similarly, A not at 3.

In ""TABLE"": A is at 2 (good, not 3), but E is at 5 (which we know is wrong for the secret word). So if we guess ""TABLE"", and if E is at 5, we know it will show as ""-"" again? But we already know E is not at 5, so it's redundant. We want to test E in a new position.

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3.

Another word: ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But position 3 for A is what we want to avoid? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not correct in the secret word, so it might be better to try a new position. However, if we put A at 3, we will get feedback that it's not there again, which we already know. So it's inefficient.

We should try to put A in a position we haven't tried. The positions we haven't tried for A are 1,2,4,5. Similarly for E: 1,2,3,4.

So let's try to have A at 1,2,4, or 5 and E at 1,2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- A at position 2 (good, not 3), E at position 5? But we want to avoid E at 5.

Not good.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad, because we know E is not at 5).

""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> has duplicate T, and E at 5.

Not ideal.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E
- A at 3? We want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can, but let's see: A at 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at 5 (which we know is wrong). So this guess would not give us new information about the positions of A and E.

We need a word that has A and E in new positions.

How about ""ADIEU""? A, D, I, E, U
- A at position 1 (new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Includes common vowels and consonants.

But ""ADIEU"" has the advantage of testing more vowels: A, I, E, U.

But we already know A and E are in the word, so testing I and U might be good.

Another option: ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E
- A at 1 (good), E at 5? But we know E is not at 5, so we should avoid that.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- A at 1, E at 5? Again, E at 5.

We need E not at 5.

How about ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wasted. Also, duplicate E might not be efficient.

""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E -> A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad).

It's challenging to find a word with E not at 5 and A not at 3.

Let me think of words ending with a letter other than E? Or with E in the middle.

For example: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But we want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not the correct position for A in the secret word. So if we put A at 3, we expect it to be ""-"" again, which doesn't give new position information. But it might be acceptable if we test other letters.

However, to maximize information, we should try A in a new position.

In ""BEADS"": A is at 3 (same as before) and E at 2 (which is new). So we would get feedback on E at 2 and A at 3 (which we know will be ""-"" for A, but we can confirm).

But we can do better.

Another word: ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T
- E at position 2 (new), A at position 3? Again, A at 3.

Same issue.

""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S -> E at 2, A at 3.

Still A at 3.

How about ""OAKEN""? But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word).

N is excluded.

""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5.

Not good.

""GAMES"": G, A, M, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4 (good! because E not at 5 and A not at 3)
- A at position 2 (which is new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (which is new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Uses G, M, S which are new letters.

This seems good.

""GAMES"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TAMED"": T, A, M, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

Also good.

But ""GAMES"" uses S, which is a very common letter.

Similarly, ""TAMED"" uses D and T.

I think ""GAMES"" is a good choice.

We could also consider ""BAKES"": B, A, K, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4.

But ""GAMES"" might be better because M is more common than K.

Another one: ""FACES"" -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

C is not allowed.

So ""GAMES"" seems solid.

Let me confirm: 
- G: new
- A: at position 2 (we know A is in the word but not at 3, so position 2 is a good test)
- M: new
- E: at position 4 (we know E is in the word but not at 5, so position 4 is a good test)
- S: new

This covers four new letters and tests A and E in new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""GAMES"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M) to gather more information.
- ""GAMES"" is chosen because:
  - A is at position 2 (a new position, not 3).
  - E is at position 4 (a new position, not 5).
  - It avoids C, R, N.
  - Introduces new common letters: G, M, S.

- S: new

This covers four new letters and tests A and E in new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""GAMES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M) to gather more information.
- ""GAMES"" is chosen because:
  - A is at position 2 (a new position, not 3).
  - E is at position 4 (a new position, not 5).
  - It avoids C, R, N.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,hazel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any prior feedback. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I choose a word that has common letters and 5 distinct letters: ""CRANE""

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE""<thinking>
We are at the start of the game with no prior feedback. A strong first guess should maximize the information gained by covering common English letters. 
- The word should be 5 letters long and contain frequently used letters to increase the chance of matches.
- Avoiding repeated letters is beneficial to cover more distinct letters.

One excellent starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- These letters are among the most common in English words (A, E, R, C, N are all top 20% in frequency).
- If any letters match (✓ or -), it narrows down possibilities significantly.

Other alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" is a classic opening choice for word games.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". 
  Specifically, A was in position 3 and E was in position 5 of ""CRANE"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes the letters A and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""CRANE"" (so A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- Avoids using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that contain A and E, avoid C, R, N, and place A and E in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for A: can be at 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for E: can be at 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We should also try to include other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with A and E and also S, T, etc.

For example:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E
  - A is at position 3? But in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in a new word, we can put A at a different position. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But we must avoid having A at position 3 because we know from feedback that A is not at position 3. So ""SLATE"" has A at position 3, which is invalid for our purpose? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't restrict our next guess. We can put A at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not correct. We should try A in a new position to get more information.

However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent us from guessing A at position 3 again, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try A in a different position.

Similarly for E: we know it's not at position 5, so we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, for our next guess, we should avoid:
- Position 3 for A
- Position 5 for E

Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N, and place A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Some ideas:

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E
  - A is at position 2 (not 3), E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our guess, we can put E at position 5? But that would be a position we know is wrong. We should avoid that to get new information. So better to put E at a different position.

We should try to put E in a position that is not 5. Similarly, A not at 3.

In ""TABLE"": A is at 2 (good, not 3), but E is at 5 (which we know is wrong for the secret word). So if we guess ""TABLE"", and if E is at 5, we know it will show as ""-"" again? But we already know E is not at 5, so it's redundant. We want to test E in a new position.

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3.

Another word: ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But position 3 for A is what we want to avoid? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not correct in the secret word, so it might be better to try a new position. However, if we put A at 3, we will get feedback that it's not there again, which we already know. So it's inefficient.

We should try to put A in a position we haven't tried. The positions we haven't tried for A are 1,2,4,5. Similarly for E: 1,2,3,4.

So let's try to have A at 1,2,4, or 5 and E at 1,2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- A at position 2 (good, not 3), E at position 5? But we want to avoid E at 5.

Not good.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad, because we know E is not at 5).

""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> has duplicate T, and E at 5.

Not ideal.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E
- A at 3? We want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can, but let's see: A at 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at 5 (which we know is wrong). So this guess would not give us new information about the positions of A and E.

We need a word that has A and E in new positions.

How about ""ADIEU""? A, D, I, E, U
- A at position 1 (new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Includes common vowels and consonants.

But ""ADIEU"" has the advantage of testing more vowels: A, I, E, U.

But we already know A and E are in the word, so testing I and U might be good.

Another option: ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E
- A at 1 (good), E at 5? But we know E is not at 5, so we should avoid that.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- A at 1, E at 5? Again, E at 5.

We need E not at 5.

How about ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wasted. Also, duplicate E might not be efficient.

""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E -> A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad).

It's challenging to find a word with E not at 5 and A not at 3.

Let me think of words ending with a letter other than E? Or with E in the middle.

For example: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But we want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not the correct position for A in the secret word. So if we put A at 3, we expect it to be ""-"" again, which doesn't give new position information. But it might be acceptable if we test other letters.

However, to maximize information, we should try A in a new position.

In ""BEADS"": A is at 3 (same as before) and E at 2 (which is new). So we would get feedback on E at 2 and A at 3 (which we know will be ""-"" for A, but we can confirm).

But we can do better.

Another word: ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T
- E at position 2 (new), A at position 3? Again, A at 3.

Same issue.

""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S -> E at 2, A at 3.

Still A at 3.

How about ""OAKEN""? But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word).

N is excluded.

""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5.

Not good.

""GAMES"": G, A, M, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4 (good! because E not at 5 and A not at 3)
- A at position 2 (which is new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (which is new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Uses G, M, S which are new letters.

This seems good.

""GAMES"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TAMED"": T, A, M, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

Also good.

But ""GAMES"" uses S, which is a very common letter.

Similarly, ""TAMED"" uses D and T.

I think ""GAMES"" is a good choice.

We could also consider ""BAKES"": B, A, K, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4.

But ""GAMES"" might be better because M is more common than K.

Another one: ""FACES"" -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

C is not allowed.

So ""GAMES"" seems solid.

Let me confirm: 
- G: new
- A: at position 2 (we know A is in the word but not at 3, so position 2 is a good test)
- M: new
- E: at position 4 (we know E is in the word but not at 5, so position 4 is a good test)
- S: new

This covers four new letters and tests A and E in new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""GAMES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M) to gather more information.
- ""GAMES"" is chosen because:
  - A is at position 2 (a new position, not 3).
  - E is at position 4 (a new position, not 5).
  - It avoids C, R, N.
  - Introduces new common letters: G, M, S.

We have two sets of feedback:
1. From CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 (as guessed).
2. From GAMES: G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)
   - G, M, S are not in the word (all x).
   - A at position 2 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the second letter is A.
   - E at position 4 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the fourth letter is E.

So we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ A _ E _
- Second letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: E (fixed)
- We know that A is also in the word, but from the first guess we knew it wasn't at position 3, and now we know it's at position 2. Similarly for E, it's now fixed at position 4.
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, N, G, M, S are not in the word.

We need to find a word with pattern _ A _ E _

The available letters: we must use only letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we have now fixed at position 4) and A is at position 2.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, no indication so far.

Possible letters: We can use common letters not excluded, such as:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but A and E are already placed, so we might have another vowel).
- Consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E _ and uses letters that might be in the word.

We have three positions to guess: 1, 3, and 5.

We already know:
- Position 1: can be any letter except the excluded ones (C, R, N, G, M, S).
- Position 3: same.
- Position 5: same.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have three slots, we can try a word that uses common letters to test.

However, note that we only have four guesses left (since we have used two).

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern.

For example:
- ""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> pattern: H-A-T-E-D -> matches _ A _ E _
  - But we need to check if the letters are allowed: H not excluded, T not excluded, D not excluded.

Another: ""BAKED"": B-A-K-E-D -> K and D are allowed? Yes.

But we have a lot of possibilities.

We need to consider which letters are most likely.

Also, from the first guess, when we guessed ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and gave ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Since we now know A is at position 2, that is consistent.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""CRANE"" and gave ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now we have E at position 4, so again consistent.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the known pattern.

What about letters we haven't tested? For example, we haven't tested L, T, D, B, P, F, H, etc.

Perhaps a word that uses L and T? Like ""LATTE"", but ""LATTE"" has double T and pattern L-A-T-T-E -> second A? Position 2 is A? Pattern: L-A-T-T-E -> positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E? Wait, position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E. So no.

The word must have E at position 4: so we need ...E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, so word is: letter1, A, letter3, E, letter5.

So pattern: X A Y E Z

We need 5-letter words in English with this pattern.

Common words: 
- BABEL? But B and L allowed? Excluded: C,R,N,G,M,S. So B is allowed? Yes. But ""BABEL"" has duplicate B? B,A,B,E,L -> second position A, fourth position E -> matches. Letters: B, A, B, E, L -> duplicate B? But allowed if the word has duplicates.

But let's check validity.

Better: ""TABLE"": T,A,B,E,L -> pattern: T-A-B-E-L -> position 4 is B, not E? TABLE: T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) -> no, we need position 4 to be E, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: word must end with E? No, letter4 is E, letter5 is anything.

Examples:
- ""PLACE"": P-L-A-C-E -> but C is excluded. Not allowed.
- ""TRACE"": T-R-A-C-E -> R and C excluded? R is excluded from first guess. 
- ""BLADE"": B,L,A,D,E -> pattern: B-A-L-D-E? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E? 4th is D? BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> so position 4 is D, we need position 4 to be E? No.

Pattern: we need letter4 to be E. So in a word, the fourth letter must be E. So the word looks like: ? A ? E ?

For example: ""VAPER""? Not common.

""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D -> positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Perfect.

Letters: P, V, D. Are they allowed? Yes, not excluded.

Another: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> same pattern.

Or ""HATED"": H-A-T-E-D.

Or ""DATED"": D-A-T-E-D.

We also know: from first guess, A is at position 3? No, position 3 is unknown. And E at position 5? We now have E at position 4.

Possible words: HATED, DATED, FADED, WAVED, JADED, etc.

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have eliminated: C,R,N,G,M,S.

We haven't tested: B,D,F,H,K,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tested, such as T, D, L, etc.

""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> uses H, T, D.

But E is already fixed, so we don't need to test E. Similarly, A is fixed.

The information we get will be about positions 1, 3, and 5: what letters are there and which are in the word.

In above, ""HATED"" has T at position 3 and D at position 5, H at position 1.

Alternatively, ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> pattern: B-A-L-E-D -> positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D -> matches _A_E_? Letter4 must be E, so B,A,L,E,D: position4 is E? B(1),A(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> yes, matches.

""BALED"" uses B, L, D.

L is a common consonant.

""TAPED"": T,A,P,E,D -> T, P, D.

Also common.

Now, we don't know the frequency, but let's choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible without duplicates.

Another: ""PAVED"": P,A,V,E,D -> letters P,V,D.

V is less common.

We can consider ""TALKE"" but E not at end? T,A,L,K,E -> pattern T-A-L-K-E -> position4 is K, not E? So no.

Must have E at position4.

List of common words with pattern _A_E_:
- HATED
- DATED
- WADED? W,A,D,E,D -> duplicate D? WADED is W-A-D-E-D, pattern:1:W,2:A,3:D,4:E,5:D. But it has double D? But that's the word.
- JADED
- FADED
- LADED? Not common.
- BALED? B,A,L,E,D -> valid.
- PALED: P,A,L,E,D -> valid.
- TABLET? Too long.

5-letter words: ABLED, AGLEY, AHEAD, etc.

""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D? No: A(1),H(2),E(3),A(4),D(5) -> but we need second letter A and fourth letter E. Here: position1:A, but position2 is H? We need position2 to be A? Word ""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D -> pattern doesn't fit because position2 is H, must be A.

We must have the second letter A and fourth letter E.

So:
- Position 1: any letter except excluded
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: any letter except excluded
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: any letter except excluded

Example: ""TABLE"" doesn't work because it has B at 3 and E at 5? TABLE: T,A,B,L,E -> position4 is L? No.

Correct: ""BAKED"": B,A,K,E,D -> yes: B(1),A(2),K(3),E(4),D(5)

But K is allowed.

""CAKED"": but C excluded.

""MAKER"": M excluded.

""TAMED"": M excluded? From second guess, M is x.

So words: with E at 4.

""HAZED"": H,A,Z,E,D -> Z not common.

""HAREM"": H,A,R,E,M -> R excluded (first guess) and M excluded.

Not allowed.

So safe choices: ""BALED"", ""HATED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".

I think ""HATED"" is a good choice because H, T, D are common.

But D is at position 5 and T at position 3.

Alternatively, ""PALED"" uses P, L, D.

Perhaps ""BALED"" to test B and L.

But let's think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Now we have E at 4, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, we don't know what position 5 is, but since we have E at 4, position 5 could be another letter, but it cannot be E? It could be duplicate E? The word might have duplicate E? But in ""HATED"", position 5 is D.

If position 5 were E, then in ""CRANE"" when E was at position 5, it would have been the correct position? But feedback was ""-"", which means wrong position but in word. If E were at position 5, it should be ✓. But it was not, so position 5 cannot be E. Also, in our current pattern, we have E only at position 4.

So position 5 is not E.

Similarly, for A, we only have A at position 2.

Now, guess: ""HATED""

But let's see: if we guess ""HATED"", the feedback might be:

- H at pos1: could be x, -, or ✓? We don't know.
- A at pos2: ✓ (we know it's correct)
- T at pos3: ? 
- E at pos4: ✓ (we know)
- D at pos5: ?

We would get information on H, T, D.

Since H, T, D are common, it's a good test.

Alternatively, ""PALED"" which has L instead of T.

I think ""HATED"" is a good choice.

We could also choose a word that has letters more likely, but we don't have information.

Given that, I go with ""HATED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From **CRANE**: A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5, respectively. C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From **GAMES**: G, M, and S are not in the word. A is correct and in position 2 (✓). E is correct and in position 4 (✓).

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? E ?** (position 2 is A, position 4 is E).
2. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S (so these cannot appear in any position).
3. The word must contain A and E as confirmed, but no duplicates are indicated yet.
4. Positions 1, 3, and 5 need new letters, avoid using excluded letters.

### Goal for Next Guess:
- Test common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, F, H, L, P, T, V, W) to cover maximum possibilities.
- Prioritize words that fit the pattern and use high-frequency letters to gather more information quickly.

### Choosing the Guess:
After filtering for valid English words with the ""? A ? E ?"" pattern and avoiding excluded letters:
- ""HATED"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses H at position 1, T at position 3, and D at position 5—all new letters.
  - H, T, and D are common consonants, providing high information value.
- Other options like ""WAVED"" (W, V, D), ""PAVED"" (P, V, D), or ""BALED"" (B, L, D) are also valid, but ""HATED"" uses more frequently occurring letters (H, T) compared to less common ones like V or L.

""HATED"" allows testing:
- Position 1 (H): Could be ✓ (correct), - (in word but wrong position), or x (not in word).
- Position 3 (T): Same as above.
- Position 5 (D): Same as above.

This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters while respecting the known pattern and exclusions.

<guess>HATED</guess>",HATED,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. From CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 (as guessed).
2. From GAMES: G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)
   - G, M, S are not in the word (all x).
   - A at position 2 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the second letter is A.
   - E at position 4 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the fourth letter is E.

So we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ A _ E _
- Second letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: E (fixed)
- We know that A is also in the word, but from the first guess we knew it wasn't at position 3, and now we know it's at position 2. Similarly for E, it's now fixed at position 4.
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, N, G, M, S are not in the word.

We need to find a word with pattern _ A _ E _

The available letters: we must use only letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we have now fixed at position 4) and A is at position 2.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, no indication so far.

Possible letters: We can use common letters not excluded, such as:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but A and E are already placed, so we might have another vowel).
- Consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E _ and uses letters that might be in the word.

We have three positions to guess: 1, 3, and 5.

- Position 3: same.
- Position 5: same.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have three slots, we can try a word that uses common letters to test.

However, note that we only have four guesses left (since we have used two).

  - But we need to check if the letters are allowed: H not excluded, T not excluded, D not excluded.

Another: ""BAKED"": B-A-K-E-D -> K and D are allowed? Yes.

But we have a lot of possibilities.

We need to consider which letters are most likely.

Also, from the first guess, when we guessed ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and gave ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Since we now know A is at position 2, that is consistent.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the known pattern.

Perhaps a word that uses L and T? Like ""LATTE"", but ""LATTE"" has double T and pattern L-A-T-T-E -> second A? Position 2 is A? Pattern: L-A-T-T-E -> positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E? Wait, position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E. So no.

The word must have E at position 4: so we need ...E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, so word is: letter1, A, letter3, E, letter5.

So pattern: X A Y E Z

We need 5-letter words in English with this pattern.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: word must end with E? No, letter4 is E, letter5 is anything.

Examples:
- ""PLACE"": P-L-A-C-E -> but C is excluded. Not allowed.
- ""TRACE"": T-R-A-C-E -> R and C excluded? R is excluded from first guess. 
- ""BLADE"": B,L,A,D,E -> pattern: B-A-L-D-E? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E? 4th is D? BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> so position 4 is D, we need position 4 to be E? No.

We also know: from first guess, A is at position 3? No, position 3 is unknown. And E at position 5? We now have E at position 4.

Possible words: HATED, DATED, FADED, WAVED, JADED, etc.

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have eliminated: C,R,N,G,M,S.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any prior feedback. We need to pick a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and avoid repeating letters.
 Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I choose a word that has common letters and 5 distinct letters: ""CRANE""

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE""<thinking>
We are at the start of the game with no prior feedback. A strong first guess should maximize the information gained by covering common English letters. 
- The word should be 5 letters long and contain frequently used letters to increase the chance of matches.
- Avoiding repeated letters is beneficial to cover more distinct letters.

One excellent starting word is ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters: C, R, A, N, E.
- These letters are among the most common in English words (A, E, R, C, N are all top 20% in frequency).
- If any letters match (✓ or -), it narrows down possibilities significantly.

Other alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""TRACE"" are also good, but ""CRANE"" is a classic opening choice for word games.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". 
  Specifically, A was in position 3 and E was in position 5 of ""CRANE"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes the letters A and E (since they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""CRANE"" (so A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
- Avoids using C, R, and N because they are not in the word.

Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We know the word has A and E. Let's think of words that contain A and E, avoid C, R, N, and place A and E in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for A: can be at 1,2,4,5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for E: can be at 1,2,3,4 (since not 5)

We should also try to include other common letters.

Let me list some candidate words:

- We could try a word with A and E and also S, T, etc.

For example:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E
  - A is at position 3? But in ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and we know it's not at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback for A was ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So in a new word, we can put A at a different position. In ""SLATE"", A is at position 3? Let's see: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But we must avoid having A at position 3 because we know from feedback that A is not at position 3. So ""SLATE"" has A at position 3, which is invalid for our purpose? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't restrict our next guess. We can put A at position 3 again? But that would be inefficient because we know it's not correct. We should try A in a new position to get more information.

However, note: the feedback doesn't prevent us from guessing A at position 3 again, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should try A in a different position.

Similarly for E: we know it's not at position 5, so we should try E in a different position.

Therefore, for our next guess, we should avoid:
- Position 3 for A
- Position 5 for E

Also, we must avoid the letters C, R, N.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid C, R, N, and place A not at 3 and E not at 5.

Some ideas:

- ""TABLE"": T, A, B, L, E
  - A is at position 2 (not 3), E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our guess, we can put E at position 5? But that would be a position we know is wrong. We should avoid that to get new information. So better to put E at a different position.

We should try to put E in a position that is not 5. Similarly, A not at 3.

In ""TABLE"": A is at 2 (good, not 3), but E is at 5 (which we know is wrong for the secret word). So if we guess ""TABLE"", and if E is at 5, we know it will show as ""-"" again? But we already know E is not at 5, so it's redundant. We want to test E in a new position.

So let's avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3.

Another word: ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But position 3 for A is what we want to avoid? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not correct in the secret word, so it might be better to try a new position. However, if we put A at 3, we will get feedback that it's not there again, which we already know. So it's inefficient.

We should try to put A in a position we haven't tried. The positions we haven't tried for A are 1,2,4,5. Similarly for E: 1,2,3,4.

So let's try to have A at 1,2,4, or 5 and E at 1,2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- A at position 2 (good, not 3), E at position 5? But we want to avoid E at 5.

Not good.

""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad, because we know E is not at 5).

""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> has duplicate T, and E at 5.

Not ideal.

""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E
- A at 3? We want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can, but let's see: A at 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at 5 (which we know is wrong). So this guess would not give us new information about the positions of A and E.

We need a word that has A and E in new positions.

How about ""ADIEU""? A, D, I, E, U
- A at position 1 (new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Includes common vowels and consonants.

But ""ADIEU"" has the advantage of testing more vowels: A, I, E, U.

But we already know A and E are in the word, so testing I and U might be good.

Another option: ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E
- A at 1 (good), E at 5? But we know E is not at 5, so we should avoid that.

""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E
- A at 1, E at 5? Again, E at 5.

We need E not at 5.

How about ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wasted. Also, duplicate E might not be efficient.

""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E -> A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad).

It's challenging to find a word with E not at 5 and A not at 3.

Let me think of words ending with a letter other than E? Or with E in the middle.

For example: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S
- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But we want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it's not the correct position for A in the secret word. So if we put A at 3, we expect it to be ""-"" again, which doesn't give new position information. But it might be acceptable if we test other letters.

However, to maximize information, we should try A in a new position.

In ""BEADS"": A is at 3 (same as before) and E at 2 (which is new). So we would get feedback on E at 2 and A at 3 (which we know will be ""-"" for A, but we can confirm).

But we can do better.

Another word: ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T
- E at position 2 (new), A at position 3? Again, A at 3.

Same issue.

""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S -> E at 2, A at 3.

Still A at 3.

How about ""OAKEN""? But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word).

N is excluded.

""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5.

Not good.

""GAMES"": G, A, M, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4 (good! because E not at 5 and A not at 3)
- A at position 2 (which is new, not 3)
- E at position 4 (which is new, not 5)
- Avoids C, R, N.
- Uses G, M, S which are new letters.

This seems good.

""GAMES"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""TAMED"": T, A, M, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

Also good.

But ""GAMES"" uses S, which is a very common letter.

Similarly, ""TAMED"" uses D and T.

I think ""GAMES"" is a good choice.

We could also consider ""BAKES"": B, A, K, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4.

But ""GAMES"" might be better because M is more common than K.

Another one: ""FACES"" -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

C is not allowed.

So ""GAMES"" seems solid.

Let me confirm: 
- G: new
- A: at position 2 (we know A is in the word but not at 3, so position 2 is a good test)
- M: new
- E: at position 4 (we know E is in the word but not at 5, so position 4 is a good test)
- S: new

This covers four new letters and tests A and E in new positions.

Therefore, I will guess ""GAMES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.
- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M) to gather more information.
- ""GAMES"" is chosen because:
  - A is at position 2 (a new position, not 3).
  - E is at position 4 (a new position, not 5).
  - It avoids C, R, N.
  - Introduces new common letters: G, M, S.

<guess>GAMES</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: GAMES -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.
   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 (as guessed).
2. From GAMES: G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)
   - G, M, S are not in the word (all x).
   - A at position 2 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the second letter is A.
   - E at position 4 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the fourth letter is E.

So we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ A _ E _
- Second letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: E (fixed)
- We know that A is also in the word, but from the first guess we knew it wasn't at position 3, and now we know it's at position 2. Similarly for E, it's now fixed at position 4.
- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, N, G, M, S are not in the word.

We need to find a word with pattern _ A _ E _

The available letters: we must use only letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S.

We also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we have now fixed at position 4) and A is at position 2.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, no indication so far.

Possible letters: We can use common letters not excluded, such as:
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but A and E are already placed, so we might have another vowel).
- Consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, Z, etc.

Our goal: Guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E _ and uses letters that might be in the word.

We have three positions to guess: 1, 3, and 5.

We already know:
- Position 1: can be any letter except the excluded ones (C, R, N, G, M, S).
- Position 3: same.
- Position 5: same.

But we want to maximize information. Since we have three slots, we can try a word that uses common letters to test.

However, note that we only have four guesses left (since we have used two).

Let's think of common words that fit the pattern.

For example:
- ""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> pattern: H-A-T-E-D -> matches _ A _ E _
  - But we need to check if the letters are allowed: H not excluded, T not excluded, D not excluded.

Another: ""BAKED"": B-A-K-E-D -> K and D are allowed? Yes.

But we have a lot of possibilities.

We need to consider which letters are most likely.

Also, from the first guess, when we guessed ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and gave ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Since we now know A is at position 2, that is consistent.

Similarly, E was at position 5 in ""CRANE"" and gave ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now we have E at position 4, so again consistent.

Now, we must choose a word that fits the known pattern.

What about letters we haven't tested? For example, we haven't tested L, T, D, B, P, F, H, etc.

Perhaps a word that uses L and T? Like ""LATTE"", but ""LATTE"" has double T and pattern L-A-T-T-E -> second A? Position 2 is A? Pattern: L-A-T-T-E -> positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E? Wait, position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E. So no.

The word must have E at position 4: so we need ...E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, so word is: letter1, A, letter3, E, letter5.

So pattern: X A Y E Z

We need 5-letter words in English with this pattern.

Common words: 
- BABEL? But B and L allowed? Excluded: C,R,N,G,M,S. So B is allowed? Yes. But ""BABEL"" has duplicate B? B,A,B,E,L -> second position A, fourth position E -> matches. Letters: B, A, B, E, L -> duplicate B? But allowed if the word has duplicates.

But let's check validity.

Better: ""TABLE"": T,A,B,E,L -> pattern: T-A-B-E-L -> position 4 is B, not E? TABLE: T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) -> no, we need position 4 to be E, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: word must end with E? No, letter4 is E, letter5 is anything.

Examples:
- ""PLACE"": P-L-A-C-E -> but C is excluded. Not allowed.
- ""TRACE"": T-R-A-C-E -> R and C excluded? R is excluded from first guess. 
- ""BLADE"": B,L,A,D,E -> pattern: B-A-L-D-E? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E? 4th is D? BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> so position 4 is D, we need position 4 to be E? No.

Pattern: we need letter4 to be E. So in a word, the fourth letter must be E. So the word looks like: ? A ? E ?

For example: ""VAPER""? Not common.

""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D -> positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Perfect.

Letters: P, V, D. Are they allowed? Yes, not excluded.

Another: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> same pattern.

Or ""HATED"": H-A-T-E-D.

Or ""DATED"": D-A-T-E-D.

We also know: from first guess, A is at position 3? No, position 3 is unknown. And E at position 5? We now have E at position 4.

Possible words: HATED, DATED, FADED, WAVED, JADED, etc.

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have eliminated: C,R,N,G,M,S.

We haven't tested: B,D,F,H,K,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z, etc.

Let's choose a word that uses common letters we haven't tested, such as T, D, L, etc.

""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> uses H, T, D.

But E is already fixed, so we don't need to test E. Similarly, A is fixed.

The information we get will be about positions 1, 3, and 5: what letters are there and which are in the word.

In above, ""HATED"" has T at position 3 and D at position 5, H at position 1.

Alternatively, ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> pattern: B-A-L-E-D -> positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D -> matches _A_E_? Letter4 must be E, so B,A,L,E,D: position4 is E? B(1),A(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> yes, matches.

""BALED"" uses B, L, D.

L is a common consonant.

""TAPED"": T,A,P,E,D -> T, P, D.

Also common.

Now, we don't know the frequency, but let's choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible without duplicates.

Another: ""PAVED"": P,A,V,E,D -> letters P,V,D.

V is less common.

We can consider ""TALKE"" but E not at end? T,A,L,K,E -> pattern T-A-L-K-E -> position4 is K, not E? So no.

Must have E at position4.

List of common words with pattern _A_E_:
- HATED
- DATED
- WADED? W,A,D,E,D -> duplicate D? WADED is W-A-D-E-D, pattern:1:W,2:A,3:D,4:E,5:D. But it has double D? But that's the word.
- JADED
- FADED
- LADED? Not common.
- BALED? B,A,L,E,D -> valid.
- PALED: P,A,L,E,D -> valid.
- TABLET? Too long.

5-letter words: ABLED, AGLEY, AHEAD, etc.

""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D? No: A(1),H(2),E(3),A(4),D(5) -> but we need second letter A and fourth letter E. Here: position1:A, but position2 is H? We need position2 to be A? Word ""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D -> pattern doesn't fit because position2 is H, must be A.

We must have the second letter A and fourth letter E.

So:
- Position 1: any letter except excluded
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 3: any letter except excluded
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: any letter except excluded

Example: ""TABLE"" doesn't work because it has B at 3 and E at 5? TABLE: T,A,B,L,E -> position4 is L? No.

Correct: ""BAKED"": B,A,K,E,D -> yes: B(1),A(2),K(3),E(4),D(5)

But K is allowed.

""CAKED"": but C excluded.

""MAKER"": M excluded.

""TAMED"": M excluded? From second guess, M is x.

So words: with E at 4.

""HAZED"": H,A,Z,E,D -> Z not common.

""HAREM"": H,A,R,E,M -> R excluded (first guess) and M excluded.

Not allowed.

So safe choices: ""BALED"", ""HATED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".

I think ""HATED"" is a good choice because H, T, D are common.

But D is at position 5 and T at position 3.

Alternatively, ""PALED"" uses P, L, D.

Perhaps ""BALED"" to test B and L.

But let's think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Now we have E at 4, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, we don't know what position 5 is, but since we have E at 4, position 5 could be another letter, but it cannot be E? It could be duplicate E? The word might have duplicate E? But in ""HATED"", position 5 is D.

If position 5 were E, then in ""CRANE"" when E was at position 5, it would have been the correct position? But feedback was ""-"", which means wrong position but in word. If E were at position 5, it should be ✓. But it was not, so position 5 cannot be E. Also, in our current pattern, we have E only at position 4.

So position 5 is not E.

Similarly, for A, we only have A at position 2.

Now, guess: ""HATED""

But let's see: if we guess ""HATED"", the feedback might be:

- H at pos1: could be x, -, or ✓? We don't know.
- A at pos2: ✓ (we know it's correct)
- T at pos3: ? 
- E at pos4: ✓ (we know)
- D at pos5: ?

We would get information on H, T, D.

Since H, T, D are common, it's a good test.

Alternatively, ""PALED"" which has L instead of T.

I think ""HATED"" is a good choice.

We could also choose a word that has letters more likely, but we don't have information.

Given that, I go with ""HATED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From **CRANE**: A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5, respectively. C, R, and N are not in the word.
- From **GAMES**: G, M, and S are not in the word. A is correct and in position 2 (✓). E is correct and in position 4 (✓).

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? E ?** (position 2 is A, position 4 is E).
2. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S (so these cannot appear in any position).
3. The word must contain A and E as confirmed, but no duplicates are indicated yet.
4. Positions 1, 3, and 5 need new letters, avoid using excluded letters.

### Goal for Next Guess:
- Test common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, F, H, L, P, T, V, W) to cover maximum possibilities.
- Prioritize words that fit the pattern and use high-frequency letters to gather more information quickly.

### Choosing the Guess:
After filtering for valid English words with the ""? A ? E ?"" pattern and avoiding excluded letters:
- ""HATED"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses H at position 1, T at position 3, and D at position 5—all new letters.
  - H, T, and D are common consonants, providing high information value.
- Other options like ""WAVED"" (W, V, D), ""PAVED"" (P, V, D), or ""BALED"" (B, L, D) are also valid, but ""HATED"" uses more frequently occurring letters (H, T) compared to less common ones like V or L.

""HATED"" allows testing:
- Position 1 (H): Could be ✓ (correct), - (in word but wrong position), or x (not in word).
- Position 3 (T): Same as above.
- Position 5 (D): Same as above.

This guess maximizes coverage of untested letters while respecting the known pattern and exclusions.

But we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So in our guess, we can put E at position 5? But that would be a position we know is wrong. We should avoid that to get new information. So better to put E at a different position.\n\nWe should try to put E in a position that is not 5. Similarly, A not at 3.\n\nIn ""TABLE"": A is at 2 (good, not 3), but E is at 5 (which we know is wrong for the secret word). So if we guess ""TABLE"", and if E is at 5, we know it will show as ""-"" again? But we already know E is not at 5, so it\'s redundant. We want to test E in a new position.\n\nSo let\'s avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A at position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T\n- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But position 3 for A is what we want to avoid? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it\'s not correct in the secret word, so it might be better to try a new position. However, if we put A at 3, we will get feedback that it\'s not there again, which we already know. So it\'s inefficient.\n\nWe should try to put A in a position we haven\'t tried. The positions we haven\'t tried for A are 1,2,4,5. Similarly for E: 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo let\'s try to have A at 1,2,4, or 5 and E at 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nAnother word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E\n- A at position 2 (good, not 3), E at position 5? But we want to avoid E at 5.\n\nNot good.\n\n""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E\n- A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad, because we know E is not at 5).\n\n""LATTE"": L, A, T, T, E -> has duplicate T, and E at 5.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E\n- A at 3? We want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can, but let\'s see: A at 3 (which we know is wrong) and E at 5 (which we know is wrong). So this guess would not give us new information about the positions of A and E.\n\nWe need a word that has A and E in new positions.\n\nHow about ""ADIEU""? A, D, I, E, U\n- A at position 1 (new, not 3)\n- E at position 4 (new, not 5)\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n- Includes common vowels and consonants.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" has the advantage of testing more vowels: A, I, E, U.\n\nBut we already know A and E are in the word, so testing I and U might be good.\n\nAnother option: ""AISLE"": A, I, S, L, E\n- A at 1 (good), E at 5? But we know E is not at 5, so we should avoid that.\n\n""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E\n- A at 1, E at 5? Again, E at 5.\n\nWe need E not at 5.\n\nHow about ""EAGLE"": E, A, G, L, E -> duplicate E, and E at position 1 and 5. But we know E is not at 5, so the E at 5 would be wasted. Also, duplicate E might not be efficient.\n\n""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E -> A at 2 (good), E at 5 (bad).\n\nIt\'s challenging to find a word with E not at 5 and A not at 3.\n\nLet me think of words ending with a letter other than E? Or with E in the middle.\n\nFor example: ""BEADS"": B, E, A, D, S\n- E at position 2 (not 5), A at position 3? But we want to avoid A at 3? Actually, we can put A at 3, but we know it\'s not the correct position for A in the secret word. So if we put A at 3, we expect it to be ""-"" again, which doesn\'t give new position information. But it might be acceptable if we test other letters.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, we should try A in a new position.\n\nIn ""BEADS"": A is at 3 (same as before) and E at 2 (which is new). So we would get feedback on E at 2 and A at 3 (which we know will be ""-"" for A, but we can confirm).\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAnother word: ""DEALT"": D, E, A, L, T\n- E at position 2 (new), A at position 3? Again, A at 3.\n\nSame issue.\n\n""HEADS"": H, E, A, D, S -> E at 2, A at 3.\n\nStill A at 3.\n\nHow about ""OAKEN""? But N is not allowed (we know N is not in the word).\n\nN is excluded.\n\n""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> A at 3, E at 5.\n\nNot good.\n\n""GAMES"": G, A, M, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4 (good! because E not at 5 and A not at 3)\n- A at position 2 (which is new, not 3)\n- E at position 4 (which is new, not 5)\n- Avoids C, R, N.\n- Uses G, M, S which are new letters.\n\nThis seems good.\n\n""GAMES"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""TAMED"": T, A, M, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.\n\nAlso good.\n\nBut ""GAMES"" uses S, which is a very common letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""TAMED"" uses D and T.\n\nI think ""GAMES"" is a good choice.\n\nWe could also consider ""BAKES"": B, A, K, E, S -> A at 2, E at 4.\n\nBut ""GAMES"" might be better because M is more common than K.\n\nAnother one: ""FACES"" -> but C is excluded, so we cannot use C.\n\nC is not allowed.\n\nSo ""GAMES"" seems solid.\n\nLet me confirm: \n- G: new\n- A: at position 2 (we know A is in the word but not at 3, so position 2 is a good test)\n- M: new\n- E: at position 4 (we know E is in the word but not at 5, so position 4 is a good test)\n- S: new\n\nThis covers four new letters and tests A and E in new positions.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""GAMES"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked with ""-"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and E (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A at position 3 or E at position 5.\n- Exclude C, R, and N entirely.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, M) to gather more information.\n- ""GAMES"" is chosen because:\n  - A is at position 2 (a new position, not 3).\n  - E is at position 4 (a new position, not 5).\n  - It avoids C, R, N.\n  - Introduces new common letters: G, M, S.\n\n<guess>GAMES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: GAMES -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n1. From CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)\n   - So letters C, R, N are not in the word at all.\n   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 (as guessed).\n2. From GAMES: G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)\n   - G, M, S are not in the word (all x).\n   - A at position 2 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the second letter is A.\n   - E at position 4 is correct (✓). So in the secret word, the fourth letter is E.\n\nSo we know:\n- The secret word has the form: _ A _ E _\n- Second letter: A (fixed)\n- Fourth letter: E (fixed)\n- We know that A is also in the word, but from the first guess we knew it wasn\'t at position 3, and now we know it\'s at position 2. Similarly for E, it\'s now fixed at position 4.\n- Additionally, we have eliminated letters: C, R, N, G, M, S are not in the word.\n\nWe need to find a word with pattern _ A _ E _\n\nThe available letters: we must use only letters not excluded. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that E is in the word (which we have now fixed at position 4) and A is at position 2.\n\nBut note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, no indication so far.\n\nPossible letters: We can use common letters not excluded, such as:\n- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (but A and E are already placed, so we might have another vowel).\n- Consonants: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, T, V, W, Y, Z, etc.\n\nOur goal: Guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E _ and uses letters that might be in the word.\n\nWe have three positions to guess: 1, 3, and 5.\n\nWe already know:\n- Position 1: can be any letter except the excluded ones (C, R, N, G, M, S).\n- Position 3: same.\n- Position 5: same.\n\nBut we want to maximize information. Since we have three slots, we can try a word that uses common letters to test.\n\nHowever, note that we only have four guesses left (since we have used two).\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit the pattern.\n\nFor example:\n- ""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> pattern: H-A-T-E-D -> matches _ A _ E _\n  - But we need to check if the letters are allowed: H not excluded, T not excluded, D not excluded.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"": B-A-K-E-D -> K and D are allowed? Yes.\n\nBut we have a lot of possibilities.\n\nWe need to consider which letters are most likely.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, when we guessed ""CRANE"", A was at position 3 and gave ""-"", meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Since we now know A is at position 2, that is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 in ""CRANE"" and gave ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at 5. Now we have E at position 4, so again consistent.\n\nNow, we must choose a word that fits the known pattern.\n\nWhat about letters we haven\'t tested? For example, we haven\'t tested L, T, D, B, P, F, H, etc.\n\nPerhaps a word that uses L and T? Like ""LATTE"", but ""LATTE"" has double T and pattern L-A-T-T-E -> second A? Position 2 is A? Pattern: L-A-T-T-E -> positions: 1:L, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E? Wait, position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E? ""LATTE"" is L-A-T-T-E, so position 4 is T, but we need position 4 to be E. So no.\n\nThe word must have E at position 4: so we need ...E at the end? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, so word is: letter1, A, letter3, E, letter5.\n\nSo pattern: X A Y E Z\n\nWe need 5-letter words in English with this pattern.\n\nCommon words: \n- BABEL? But B and L allowed? Excluded: C,R,N,G,M,S. So B is allowed? Yes. But ""BABEL"" has duplicate B? B,A,B,E,L -> second position A, fourth position E -> matches. Letters: B, A, B, E, L -> duplicate B? But allowed if the word has duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s check validity.\n\nBetter: ""TABLE"": T,A,B,E,L -> pattern: T-A-B-E-L -> position 4 is B, not E? TABLE: T(1),A(2),B(3),L(4),E(5) -> no, we need position 4 to be E, so not.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: word must end with E? No, letter4 is E, letter5 is anything.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PLACE"": P-L-A-C-E -> but C is excluded. Not allowed.\n- ""TRACE"": T-R-A-C-E -> R and C excluded? R is excluded from first guess. \n- ""BLADE"": B,L,A,D,E -> pattern: B-A-L-D-E? Positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E? 4th is D? BLADE: B, L, A, D, E -> so position 4 is D, we need position 4 to be E? No.\n\nPattern: we need letter4 to be E. So in a word, the fourth letter must be E. So the word looks like: ? A ? E ?\n\nFor example: ""VAPER""? Not common.\n\n""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D -> positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Perfect.\n\nLetters: P, V, D. Are they allowed? Yes, not excluded.\n\nAnother: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D -> same pattern.\n\nOr ""HATED"": H-A-T-E-D.\n\nOr ""DATED"": D-A-T-E-D.\n\nWe also know: from first guess, A is at position 3? No, position 3 is unknown. And E at position 5? We now have E at position 4.\n\nPossible words: HATED, DATED, FADED, WAVED, JADED, etc.\n\nBut we need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have eliminated: C,R,N,G,M,S.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B,D,F,H,K,L,P,T,V,W,Y,Z, etc.\n\nLet\'s choose a word that uses common letters we haven\'t tested, such as T, D, L, etc.\n\n""HATED"": H, A, T, E, D -> uses H, T, D.\n\nBut E is already fixed, so we don\'t need to test E. Similarly, A is fixed.\n\nThe information we get will be about positions 1, 3, and 5: what letters are there and which are in the word.\n\nIn above, ""HATED"" has T at position 3 and D at position 5, H at position 1.\n\nAlternatively, ""BALED"": B,A,L,E,D -> pattern: B-A-L-E-D -> positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:E, 5:D -> matches _A_E_? Letter4 must be E, so B,A,L,E,D: position4 is E? B(1),A(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> yes, matches.\n\n""BALED"" uses B, L, D.\n\nL is a common consonant.\n\n""TAPED"": T,A,P,E,D -> T, P, D.\n\nAlso common.\n\nNow, we don\'t know the frequency, but let\'s choose a word that tests as many new letters as possible without duplicates.\n\nAnother: ""PAVED"": P,A,V,E,D -> letters P,V,D.\n\nV is less common.\n\nWe can consider ""TALKE"" but E not at end? T,A,L,K,E -> pattern T-A-L-K-E -> position4 is K, not E? So no.\n\nMust have E at position4.\n\nList of common words with pattern _A_E_:\n- HATED\n- DATED\n- WADED? W,A,D,E,D -> duplicate D? WADED is W-A-D-E-D, pattern:1:W,2:A,3:D,4:E,5:D. But it has double D? But that\'s the word.\n- JADED\n- FADED\n- LADED? Not common.\n- BALED? B,A,L,E,D -> valid.\n- PALED: P,A,L,E,D -> valid.\n- TABLET? Too long.\n\n5-letter words: ABLED, AGLEY, AHEAD, etc.\n\n""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D? No: A(1),H(2),E(3),A(4),D(5) -> but we need second letter A and fourth letter E. Here: position1:A, but position2 is H? We need position2 to be A? Word ""AHEAD"": A,H,E,A,D -> pattern doesn\'t fit because position2 is H, must be A.\n\nWe must have the second letter A and fourth letter E.\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: any letter except excluded\n- Position 2: A (fixed)\n- Position 3: any letter except excluded\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- Position 5: any letter except excluded\n\nExample: ""TABLE"" doesn\'t work because it has B at 3 and E at 5? TABLE: T,A,B,L,E -> position4 is L? No.\n\nCorrect: ""BAKED"": B,A,K,E,D -> yes: B(1),A(2),K(3),E(4),D(5)\n\nBut K is allowed.\n\n""CAKED"": but C excluded.\n\n""MAKER"": M excluded.\n\n""TAMED"": M excluded? From second guess, M is x.\n\nSo words: with E at 4.\n\n""HAZED"": H,A,Z,E,D -> Z not common.\n\n""HAREM"": H,A,R,E,M -> R excluded (first guess) and M excluded.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nSo safe choices: ""BALED"", ""HATED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".\n\nI think ""HATED"" is a good choice because H, T, D are common.\n\nBut D is at position 5 and T at position 3.\n\nAlternatively, ""PALED"" uses P, L, D.\n\nPerhaps ""BALED"" to test B and L.\n\nBut let\'s think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5, and it was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Now we have E at 4, so position 5 cannot be E? Actually, we don\'t know what position 5 is, but since we have E at 4, position 5 could be another letter, but it cannot be E? It could be duplicate E? The word might have duplicate E? But in ""HATED"", position 5 is D.\n\nIf position 5 were E, then in ""CRANE"" when E was at position 5, it would have been the correct position? But feedback was ""-"", which means wrong position but in word. If E were at position 5, it should be ✓. But it was not, so position 5 cannot be E. Also, in our current pattern, we have E only at position 4.\n\nSo position 5 is not E.\n\nSimilarly, for A, we only have A at position 2.\n\nNow, guess: ""HATED""\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""HATED"", the feedback might be:\n\n- H at pos1: could be x, -, or ✓? We don\'t know.\n- A at pos2: ✓ (we know it\'s correct)\n- T at pos3: ? \n- E at pos4: ✓ (we know)\n- D at pos5: ?\n\nWe would get information on H, T, D.\n\nSince H, T, D are common, it\'s a good test.\n\nAlternatively, ""PALED"" which has L instead of T.\n\nI think ""HATED"" is a good choice.\n\nWe could also choose a word that has letters more likely, but we don\'t have information.\n\nGiven that, I go with ""HATED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- From **CRANE**: A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5, respectively. C, R, and N are not in the word.\n- From **GAMES**: G, M, and S are not in the word. A is correct and in position 2 (✓). E is correct and in position 4 (✓).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? E ?** (position 2 is A, position 4 is E).\n2. Excluded letters: C, R, N, G, M, S (so these cannot appear in any position).\n3. The word must contain A and E as confirmed, but no duplicates are indicated yet.\n4. Positions 1, 3, and 5 need new letters, avoid using excluded letters.\n\n### Goal for Next Guess:\n- Test common unused consonants (e.g., B, D, F, H, L, P, T, V, W) to cover maximum possibilities.\n- Prioritize words that fit the pattern and use high-frequency letters to gather more information quickly.\n\n### Choosing the Guess:\nAfter filtering for valid English words with the ""? A ? E ?"" pattern and avoiding excluded letters:\n- ""HATED"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - It uses H at position 1, T at position 3, and D at position 5—all new letters.\n  - H, T, and D are common consonants, providing high information value.\n- Other options like ""WAVED"" (W, V, D), ""PAVED"" (P, V, D), or ""BALED"" (B, L, D) are also valid, but ""HATED"" uses more frequently occurring letters (H, T) compared to less common ones like V or L.\n\n""HATED"" allows testing:\n- Position 1 (H): Could be ✓ (correct), - (in word but wrong position), or x (not in word).\n- Position 3 (T): Same as above.\n- Position 5 (D): Same as above.\n\nThis guess maximizes coverage of untested letters while respecting the known pattern and exclusions.\n\n<guess>HATED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: GAMES -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: HATED -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: 
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So, A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. **GAMES**:
   - G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)
   - A is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4.
   - G, M, S are not in the word.

3. **HATED**:
   - H(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(x)
   - H is correct at position 1, A is correct at position 2 (already known), E is correct at position 4 (already known).
   - T and D are not in the word.

### What we know:
- **Secret word pattern**: H A ? E ? 
  - Position 1: H (fixed)
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 3: unknown (but not T, D, and not any excluded letters)
  - Position 4: E (fixed)
  - Position 5: unknown (but not T, D, and not excluded)

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, G, M, S, T, D (all marked 'x' in previous guesses)
- **Included and placed letters**: H (pos1), A (pos2), E (pos4)

- **Letters to test for positions 3 and 5**: 
  - We need to find letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, R, N, G, M, S, T, D.
  - Available letters: B, F, K, L, P, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels O, I, U (but note A and E are already placed, so we might have more vowels?).

- **Position 3 and 5 constraints**: 
  - They must be letters not in the excluded list.
  - The word must be a valid English word.

### Next guess:
We need to guess a word that fits the pattern ""H A ? E ?"", with the third and fifth letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- We can try to fill in the blanks with common letters to test.

Common available letters: L, P, B, F, K, W, Y.

Examples of words:
- ""HALVE"": H, A, L, V, E -> but pattern is H A L V E, so position 4 is V? We need position 4 to be E. So no, ""HALVE"" has E at position 5? H(1),A(2),L(3),V(4),E(5) -> but we need position 4 to be E, so this doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: H A _ E _ 

So:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: ?

So the word must be like: H A ? E ?

For example:
- ""HAREM"": but R and M are excluded (R from guess1, M from guess2). Not allowed.
- ""HATED"": we already tried, and T and D are excluded.
- ""HAVEN"": H,A,V,E,N -> but N is excluded (from guess1). Not allowed.
- ""HAZEL"": H,A,Z,E,L -> pattern: H(1),A(2),Z(3),E(4),L(5). This fits. Z and L are available? Z is not excluded, L is not excluded.
- ""HAREL"": not a common word.
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""HALLE"": not a word? Halle is a name, but let's stick to common words.

More common: ""HARES""? But R is excluded.

""HAVES"": H,A,V,E,S -> but S is excluded (guess2).

""HAWED"": H,A,W,E,D -> but D is excluded (guess3).

""HAZED"": H,A,Z,E,D -> D excluded.

""HAVEN"": N excluded.

""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> S and T excluded.

""PALER"": but P at start? We need H at start.

We must have H at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

So: ""H A ? E ?""

Another: ""HALER"": H,A,L,E,R -> but R excluded.

""HAFIZ""? Not common.

""KAPUT""? Doesn't fit.

""VALID""? Doesn't start with H.

Perhaps ""HALVE"" is not valid because of the pattern.

Wait, we need position 4 to be E. So in ""HALVE"", position 4 is V, not E. So it doesn't fit.

What about ""HALOE""? Not a word.

""HAVOC"": H,A,V,O,C -> C excluded and position 4 is O, not E.

""HAYED"": H,A,Y,E,D -> D excluded.

""HAWSE"": H,A,W,S,E -> S excluded.

""HAFTS"": H,A,F,T,S -> T and S excluded.

This is tricky.

Another possibility: ""HABLE"" is not a word, but ""HABILE"" is too long.

5-letter words: How about ""HALED""? H,A,L,E,D -> but D is excluded (from guess3).

D is excluded.

""HAVEN"" has N excluded.

""HAZEL"": H,A,Z,E,L -> this is a word (a name or a nut). And Z and L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""HAZES"": but S excluded.

""HAZER"": R excluded.

So ""HAZEL"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""HAPLY"": H,A,P,L,Y -> pattern: H(1),A(2),P(3),L(4),Y(5) -> but we need position 4 to be E, so no.

We must have E at position 4.

So only words like: H A ? E ?

Other examples:
- ""HARED"": R and D excluded.
- ""HAREM"": R and M excluded.
- ""HATED"": T and D excluded.

What about ""HALME""? Not a word.

""HAVEE""? Not a word.

""HAWKE""? Not common.

""HAYEY""? Not a word.

""HAZED"": D excluded.

But ""HAZEL"" is valid: H, A, Z, E, L? No: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> position 4 is E? In ""HAZEL"", the letters are H-A-Z-E-L, so:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: Z
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: L

Yes, that matches the pattern.

And Z and L are not excluded.

Another word: ""HABLE"" is not standard, but ""HALER"" is a word but R excluded.

""HAVEN"" is not allowed.

So ""HAZEL"" seems a possible guess.

But is ""HAZEL"" a valid word? Yes, it can be a name or a type of tree/nut.

We can use it.

But let's see if there are better options.

""HAFTS"" excluded.

""HAKES"": H,A,K,E,S -> S excluded.

""HAKIM"": H,A,K,I,M -> M excluded and position 4 is I, not E.

""HAFIZ"": H,A,F,I,Z -> position 4 is I, not E.

""HAWED"": D excluded.

So ""HAZEL"" might be one of the few options.

Another: ""HALED"" is excluded because of D.

""HAYED"" excluded.

""HAWSE"" excluded.

So I think ""HAZEL"" is a valid guess.

But we can also consider ""HABLE"" if we accept it, but it's not common.

Perhaps ""HALVE"" but pattern doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""HANCE""? But C excluded and position 4 is C, not E.

No.

""HANSE"": H,A,N,S,E -> N and S excluded.

Not allowed.

So ""HAZEL"" is a candidate.

But let's check the feedback: we have position 1,2,4 fixed, so we only need to find position 3 and 5.

In ""HAZEL"", we are guessing Z for position 3 and L for position 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we might have other words.

What about ""HAPES""? Not a word.

""HAVES"": S excluded.

""HAIRE""? Not common.

""HAKED""? D excluded.

I think ""HAZEL"" is acceptable.

But let's think of more common words.

""HASTE"": excluded letters.

""PAGE"" not 5 letters.

Another: ""HALMA"" not pattern.

Perhaps ""HALER"" is the only common one, but R excluded.

So I'll go with ""HAZEL"".

But we can also consider ""HABLE"" if we are desperate, but let's avoid.

""HAVEN"" is not allowed.

""HAZLE"" is a misspelling.

So ""HAZEL"" is the best we have.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was not E, so position 5 is not E. Similarly, in ""HAZEL"", position 5 is L, which is fine.

Also, position 3 is Z, which is less common, but possible.

We could try ""HALVE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because position 4 is V, not E.

Unless we have a word like ""HAVE"" but it's 4 letters.

No.

Another word: ""HARLE"" not common.

I think we should go with ""HAZEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: H A Z E L -> positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:L. Matches.

And Z and L are not excluded.

So guess: ""HAZEL""

But we have only one E? The word has E at position 4, and no other E? But we don't know if there are duplicates. However, in previous feedback, when we had E at position 5 in ""CRANE"", it was not correct, so if there were an E at position 5, it would have been marked differently? But we have E only at position 4.

Similarly, A only at position 2.

So ""HAZEL"" should be fine.

If we are wrong, we get feedback on Z and L.

But we have to guess.

Perhaps there is a better word.

What about ""HABLE""? Not a word.

""HAILE""? Not common.

""HAKEE""? No.

I think ""HAZEL"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-) → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, N are excluded.
   - **Guess 2 (GAMES)**:
     - G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x) → A is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4. G, M, S are excluded.
   - **Guess 3 (HATED)**:
     - H(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(x) → H is correct at position 1, A is confirmed at position 2, E is confirmed at position 4. T and D are excluded.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**: 
     - Position 1: H (✓ from Guess 3)
     - Position 2: A (✓ from Guess 2 and 3)
     - Position 4: E (✓ from Guess 2 and 3)
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, R, N (from Guess 1), G, M, S (from Guess 2), T, D (from Guess 3). Total excluded: C, R, N, G, M, S, T, D.
   - **Unknown Positions**: 
     - Position 3: Must be a letter not excluded. Possible letters: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, Z (H is already used at position 1 but could be duplicated; however, no duplicates are indicated yet).
     - Position 5: Same constraints as position 3.
   - **Pattern**: The secret word is `H A ? E ?`, where `?` represents unknown letters from the available set.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on testing common unused letters for positions 3 and 5 (e.g., L, P, B, F, K, W) to maximize information.
   - Avoid excluded letters and ensure the word fits the pattern `H A ? E ?`.
   - Since only positions 3 and 5 are unknown, prioritize words that use high-frequency letters to quickly narrow possibilities.
   - Consider valid English words: After filtering, ""HAZEL"" (H, A, Z, E, L) fits the pattern and uses available letters (Z and L are not excluded). Z is less common but tests a new letter, while L is a high-frequency consonant.

4. **Why ""HAZEL""?**:
   - Position 3: Z (new letter, not tested before).
   - Position 5: L (common letter, not tested).
   - If Z or L are in the word, feedback will reveal their status (✓, -, or x), helping to solve the remaining positions.
   - Alternatives like ""HABLE"" (invalid) or ""HALVE"" (incorrect pattern) are not suitable. ""HAZEL"" is a valid word (e.g., a name or referring to a tree/nut).

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If Z is correct at position 3, it will be marked ✓.
   - If L is correct at position 5, it will be marked ✓.
   - If either is misplaced (e.g., in the word but wrong position), it will be marked -.
   - If excluded, marked x, further reducing possibilities.

<guess>HAZEL</guess>",HAZEL,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: 
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So, A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - C, R, N are not in the word.

2. **GAMES**:
   - G(x), A(✓), M(x), E(✓), S(x)
   - A is correct at position 2, E is correct at position 4.
   - G, M, S are not in the word.

3. **HATED**:
   - H(✓), A(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(x)
   - H is correct at position 1, A is correct at position 2 (already known), E is correct at position 4 (already known).
   - T and D are not in the word.

### What we know:
- **Secret word pattern**: H A ? E ? 
  - Position 1: H (fixed)
  - Position 2: A (fixed)
  - Position 3: unknown (but not T, D, and not any excluded letters)
  - Position 4: E (fixed)
  - Position 5: unknown (but not T, D, and not excluded)

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, G, M, S, T, D (all marked 'x' in previous guesses)
- **Included and placed letters**: H (pos1), A (pos2), E (pos4)

- **Letters to test for positions 3 and 5**: 
  - We need to find letters that are not excluded. Excluded: C, R, N, G, M, S, T, D.
  - Available letters: B, F, K, L, P, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels O, I, U (but note A and E are already placed, so we might have more vowels?).

- **Position 3 and 5 constraints**: 
  - They must be letters not in the excluded list.
  - The word must be a valid English word.

### Next guess:
We need to guess a word that fits the pattern ""H A ? E ?"", with the third and fifth letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- We can try to fill in the blanks with common letters to test.

Common available letters: L, P, B, F, K, W, Y.

Examples of words:
- ""HALVE"": H, A, L, V, E -> but pattern is H A L V E, so position 4 is V? We need position 4 to be E. So no, ""HALVE"" has E at position 5? H(1),A(2),L(3),V(4),E(5) -> but we need position 4 to be E, so this doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: H A _ E _ 

So:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: ?

So the word must be like: H A ? E ?

For example:
- ""HAREM"": but R and M are excluded (R from guess1, M from guess2). Not allowed.
- ""HATED"": we already tried, and T and D are excluded.
- ""HAVEN"": H,A,V,E,N -> but N is excluded (from guess1). Not allowed.
- ""HAZEL"": H,A,Z,E,L -> pattern: H(1),A(2),Z(3),E(4),L(5). This fits. Z and L are available? Z is not excluded, L is not excluded.
- ""HAREL"": not a common word.
- ""HABLE"": not a word.
- ""HALLE"": not a word? Halle is a name, but let's stick to common words.

More common: ""HARES""? But R is excluded.

""HAVES"": H,A,V,E,S -> but S is excluded (guess2).

""HAWED"": H,A,W,E,D -> but D is excluded (guess3).

""HAZED"": H,A,Z,E,D -> D excluded.

""HAVEN"": N excluded.

""HASTE"": H,A,S,T,E -> S and T excluded.

""PALER"": but P at start? We need H at start.

We must have H at 1, A at 2, E at 4.

So: ""H A ? E ?""

Another: ""HALER"": H,A,L,E,R -> but R excluded.

""HAFIZ""? Not common.

""KAPUT""? Doesn't fit.

""VALID""? Doesn't start with H.

Perhaps ""HALVE"" is not valid because of the pattern.

Wait, we need position 4 to be E. So in ""HALVE"", position 4 is V, not E. So it doesn't fit.

What about ""HALOE""? Not a word.

""HAVOC"": H,A,V,O,C -> C excluded and position 4 is O, not E.

""HAYED"": H,A,Y,E,D -> D excluded.

""HAWSE"": H,A,W,S,E -> S excluded.

""HAFTS"": H,A,F,T,S -> T and S excluded.

This is tricky.

Another possibility: ""HABLE"" is not a word, but ""HABILE"" is too long.

5-letter words: How about ""HALED""? H,A,L,E,D -> but D is excluded (from guess3).

D is excluded.

""HAVEN"" has N excluded.

""HAZEL"": H,A,Z,E,L -> this is a word (a name or a nut). And Z and L are not excluded.

Similarly, ""HAZES"": but S excluded.

""HAZER"": R excluded.

So ""HAZEL"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""HAPLY"": H,A,P,L,Y -> pattern: H(1),A(2),P(3),L(4),Y(5) -> but we need position 4 to be E, so no.

We must have E at position 4.

So only words like: H A ? E ?

Other examples:
- ""HARED"": R and D excluded.
- ""HAREM"": R and M excluded.
- ""HATED"": T and D excluded.

What about ""HALME""? Not a word.

""HAVEE""? Not a word.

""HAWKE""? Not common.

""HAYEY""? Not a word.

""HAZED"": D excluded.

But ""HAZEL"" is valid: H, A, Z, E, L? No: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> position 4 is E? In ""HAZEL"", the letters are H-A-Z-E-L, so:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: Z
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: L

Yes, that matches the pattern.

And Z and L are not excluded.

Another word: ""HABLE"" is not standard, but ""HALER"" is a word but R excluded.

""HAVEN"" is not allowed.

So ""HAZEL"" seems a possible guess.

But is ""HAZEL"" a valid word? Yes, it can be a name or a type of tree/nut.

We can use it.

But let's see if there are better options.

""HAFTS"" excluded.

""HAKES"": H,A,K,E,S -> S excluded.

""HAKIM"": H,A,K,I,M -> M excluded and position 4 is I, not E.

""HAFIZ"": H,A,F,I,Z -> position 4 is I, not E.

""HAWED"": D excluded.

So ""HAZEL"" might be one of the few options.

Another: ""HALED"" is excluded because of D.

""HAYED"" excluded.

""HAWSE"" excluded.

So I think ""HAZEL"" is a valid guess.

But we can also consider ""HABLE"" if we accept it, but it's not common.

Perhaps ""HALVE"" but pattern doesn't fit.

Another idea: ""HANCE""? But C excluded and position 4 is C, not E.

No.

""HANSE"": H,A,N,S,E -> N and S excluded.

Not allowed.

So ""HAZEL"" is a candidate.

But let's check the feedback: we have position 1,2,4 fixed, so we only need to find position 3 and 5.

In ""HAZEL"", we are guessing Z for position 3 and L for position 5.

""HAKED""? D excluded.

I think ""HAZEL"" is acceptable.

But let's think of more common words.

""HASTE"": excluded letters.

""PAGE"" not 5 letters.

Another: ""HALMA"" not pattern.

Perhaps ""HALER"" is the only common one, but R excluded.

So I'll go with ""HAZEL"".

But we can also consider ""HABLE"" if we are desperate, but let's avoid.

""HAVEN"" is not allowed.

""HAZLE"" is a misspelling.

So ""HAZEL"" is the best we have.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was not E, so position 5 is not E. Similarly, in ""HAZEL"", position 5 is L, which is fine.

Also, position 3 is Z, which is less common, but possible.

We could try ""HALVE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because position 4 is V, not E.

Unless we have a word like ""HAVE"" but it's 4 letters.

No.

Another word: ""HARLE"" not common.

I think we should go with ""HAZEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: H A Z E L -> positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:L. Matches.

And Z and L are not excluded.

So guess: ""HAZEL""

But we have only one E? The word has E at position 4, and no other E? But we don't know if there are duplicates. However, in previous feedback, when we had E at position 5 in ""CRANE"", it was not correct, so if there were an E at position 5, it would have been marked differently?
