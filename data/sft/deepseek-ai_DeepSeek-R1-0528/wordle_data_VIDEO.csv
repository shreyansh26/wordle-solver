We are starting the game. For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
We should choose a word that is likely to have common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information.

Commonly used starting words in wordle include words like 'CRANE', 'SLATE', 'TRACE', etc., because they contain common letters and have a balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

However, note that we are not limited to those, but I want a word with distinct letters if possible to cover more ground.

Let me think: one word that is often used is 'RAISE' because it has three vowels and two common consonants, but let's consider 'CRATE'. Alternatively, 'ROUSE' might be good too.

But note that the feedback tells us about:
- Correct position (✓)
- Present in word but wrong position (-)
- Absent (x)

So we want to test letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Another excellent starting word is 'AUDIO' which gets four vowels, but then we might miss consonants. Alternatively, we can use 'ADIEU' to get four vowels and 'D', but then we have two vowels repeated? Actually, 'ADIEU' has A, D, I, E, U. That's five distinct letters: two vowels? Wait, A, I, E, U are vowels and D is a consonant.

But we also want consonants. Another good one is 'CRANE'.

Considering a balance, I'll go with 'CRANE':

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be: CRANE

Let's output accordingly.

For the first guess, I want to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters that frequently appear in English words. A good starting point is words that include frequent consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- The letter ""C"" which is a common consonant.
- The letter ""R"" and ""N"", both of which are top-frequency consonants.
- The vowels ""A"" and ""E"", which are among the most common vowels in 5-letter words.

This word uses 5 distinct letters, covering a broad range of possibilities and helping identify correct positions or misplaced letters efficiently. There’s no feedback yet since it’s the first turn, but this guess will provide valuable clues for subsequent moves.

We are given feedback from our first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"", E was the last letter, and it's marked as (-), meaning wrong position)

So from this, we know:
The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. It does contain E, but not as the last letter.

Now, since the word does not contain A and E was at the end in our guess but is misplaced, E must be in one of the first four positions.

We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

For our next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end. We know E cannot be the 5th letter.
2. Avoids using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Ideally, uses common letters that haven't been tested yet to maximize information.

We have only used one vowel: A (which was incorrect). But note, we have E in the word. We might need another vowel? The word must have E and possibly other vowels.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A, so the vowel possibilities are E (already present), I, O, U.

Common consonants: We also need consonants that haven't been tried. Remember, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

We've tried: C, R, A, N, E (E is in the word).

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is in the word, so we should include E.

Now, considering that E must be in one of positions 1,2,3, or4.

Since the feedback didn't give any ✓ (correct position), E is not in the 5th position, which we already know, and also none of C,R,A,N were in any position.

Now, we need a word that has E in either position 1,2,3, or4.

Let's think about common words with E not at the end.

For example:
- Words with E at the beginning: ELBOW, ECLAT (but C is eliminated?), ECLAT has C and we know C is not in the word, so avoid C.
So we must avoid C,R,A,N.

Let me think of words that avoid C,R,A,N and have E in a new position.

We also want to test other letters.

List of possible words that meet the criteria:
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, N
- Include E, not in last position (so position 1,2,3, or4)

First, E as the first letter? Words like:
  ELITE (but T and L) -> letters: E,L,I,T,E -> but E repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters? The secret word might have repeated letters? We should only use distinct letters for now to test more letters? But the feedback might not show duplicates well? Actually, it's okay, but we can avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Actually, 'ELITE' has two E's. But we can use it if we want. To avoid confusion, maybe use a word with distinct letters.

Possible words:
- With E in position 1: E (then avoid C,R,A,N). Examples: 
  EDIFY -> E,D,I,F,Y -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y. All distinct? E is once? Then not repeated? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N. So that's good.
- With E in position 2: For example, DEITY? But D, E, I, T, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N.
  However, in DEITY, E is in position 2? D-E-I-T-Y. Yes.
- With E in position 3: Example, BLUEP? Not common. Try SCEPT? But C in it. Better: THIEF -> T,H,I,E,F -> E in position 4? T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5). Then E is fourth? But we need E not last? Fourth is not last? The fifth is last. So that would be okay? E is in fourth? Then fifth is F. So E is not last? Yes.

Actually, position is 1-based: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.

In THIEF: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F. So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.

But in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.

But we don't know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can't test all at once.

Alternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.

Considering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.

For example, 'PIECE' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let's try distinct.

So possible words:
- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.
- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.

Important: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x? Because E is in the word but not in position 5, so if we guess it at 5, it would be ""wrong position""? But in the feedback, since E is present, if we put E at a position where it's not, we get (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Similarly, if we put E at a position that is correct, we get (✓).

But we don't know E's correct position yet. Therefore, we should avoid placing E in position 5 to avoid wasting the position for E? Because we know it cannot be there? And we want to test other letters.

Thus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.

Now, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.

Another word? 'TOWEL' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.

But E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.

Another word: 'HEIST' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.

Which one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.

HEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.

Similarly, 'SLEPT' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.

But SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.

HEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.

But S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Similarly, 'SHITE'? Not polite. Avoid that.

'FIELD': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.

But FIELD in word list? We are assuming it is valid.

Perhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.

I think HEIST is a good candidate: 
- H: tests a consonant
- E in position 2? But we don't know if that's correct; it's just to see.
- I: vowel
- S: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Similarly, 'DEIST' might be less common.

But HEIST is common.

Another word? 'QUEST' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.

Perhaps HEIST is better.

But let's consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it's at position 2.

Since we don't know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven't tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.

In HEIST, E is at position 2.

In EDIFY, E at 1.

In THIEF? Earlier THIEF: T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5) -> E at 4.

So all are possibilities.

I think HEIST is good because it uses S and T, which are highly common and give good coverage.

So let's go with HEIST.

Guess: HEIST

Letters: H, E, I, S, T.

If E is in position 2, we might get ✓ for E? But we don't know.

It might be better to choose a word where E is not the same position in case, but it's fine.

Another word: 'STOLE' -> but O? And E at the last? Not allowed? E cannot be position 5? So if E is last, we cannot guess it? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong position? And it wastes a spot. Better to avoid.

So HEIST seems good.

Thus, my second guess: HEIST

But note: in HEIST, E is in position 2? Only after the H? We haven't tested any other positions.

So I will go with HEIST.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed present), placed in any position except the 5th.
- It should avoid any words containing C, R, A, or N (as they are eliminated).
- The guess should focus on testing new letters, especially common consonants (e.g., S, T, L) or vowels (e.g., I, O, U) to gain more information.
- ""HEIST"" is a strong candidate:
  - It contains E in position 2 (to test a new position for E, as it was in position 5 last time).
  - Letters H, I, S, and T are all untested and common in English words.
  - No eliminated letters: avoids C, R, A, N.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possible words.

This guess aims to identify the correct position for E and gather feedback on other frequent letters.

Fourth is not last? The fifth is last. So that would be okay? E is in fourth? Then fifth is F. So E is not last? Yes.

Actually, position is 1-based: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.

In THIEF: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F. So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.

But in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.

But we don't know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can't test all at once.

Alternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.

Considering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.

For example, 'PIECE' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let's try distinct.

So possible words:
- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.
- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.

Important: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x? Because E is in the word but not in position 5, so if we guess it at 5, it would be ""wrong position""? But in the feedback, since E is present, if we put E at a position where it's not, we get (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Similarly, if we put E at a position that is correct, we get (✓).

But we don't know E's correct position yet. Therefore, we should avoid placing E in position 5 to avoid wasting the position for E? Because we know it cannot be there? And we want to test other letters.

Thus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.

Now, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.

Another word? 'TOWEL' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.

But E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.

Another word: 'HEIST' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.

Which one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.

HEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.

Similarly, 'SLEPT' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.

But SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.

HEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.

But S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Similarly, 'SHITE'? Not polite. Avoid that.

'FIELD': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.

But FIELD in word list? We are assuming it is valid.

Perhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.

I think HEIST is a good candidate: 
- H: tests a consonant
- E in position 2? But we don't know if that's correct; it's just to see.
- I: vowel
- S: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Similarly, 'DEIST' might be less common.

But HEIST is common.

Another word? 'QUEST' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.

Perhaps HEIST is better.

But let's consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it's at position 2.

Since we don't know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven't tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.

In HEIST, E is at position 2.

In EDIFY, E at 1.

In THIEF? Earlier THIEF: T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5) -> E at 4.

So all are possibilities.

I think HEIST is good because it uses S and T, which are highly common and give good coverage.

So let's go with HEIST.

Guess: HEIST

Letters: H, E, I, S, T.

If E is in position 2, we might get ✓ for E? But we don't know.

It might be better to choose a word where E is not the same position in case, but it's fine.

Another word: 'STOLE' -> but O? And E at the last? Not allowed? E cannot be position 5? So if E is last, we cannot guess it? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong position? And it wastes a spot. Better to avoid.

So HEIST seems good.

Thus, my second guess: HEIST

But note: in HEIST, E is in position 2? Only after the H? We haven't tested any other positions.

So I will go with HEIST.Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed present), placed in any position except the 5th.
- It should avoid any words containing C, R, A, or N (as they are eliminated).
- The guess should focus on testing new letters, especially common consonants (e.g., S, T, L) or vowels (e.g., I, O, U) to gain more information.
- ""HEIST"" is a strong candidate:
  - It contains E in position 2 (to test a new position for E, as it was in position 5 last time).
  - Letters H, I, S, and T are all untested and common in English words.
  - No eliminated letters: avoids C, R, A, N.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possible words.

This guess aims to identify the correct position for E and gather feedback on other frequent letters.",Guess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,VIDEO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
We should choose a word that is likely to have common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information.

Commonly used starting words in wordle include words like 'CRANE', 'SLATE', 'TRACE', etc., because they contain common letters and have a balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

However, note that we are not limited to those, but I want a word with distinct letters if possible to cover more ground.

Let me think: one word that is often used is 'RAISE' because it has three vowels and two common consonants, but let's consider 'CRATE'. Alternatively, 'ROUSE' might be good too.

But note that the feedback tells us about:
- Correct position (✓)
- Present in word but wrong position (-)
- Absent (x)

So we want to test letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Another excellent starting word is 'AUDIO' which gets four vowels, but then we might miss consonants. Alternatively, we can use 'ADIEU' to get four vowels and 'D', but then we have two vowels repeated? Actually, 'ADIEU' has A, D, I, E, U. That's five distinct letters: two vowels? Wait, A, I, E, U are vowels and D is a consonant.

But we also want consonants. Another good one is 'CRANE'.

Considering a balance, I'll go with 'CRANE':

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be: CRANE

Let's output accordingly.For the first guess, I want to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters that frequently appear in English words. A good starting point is words that include frequent consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- The letter ""C"" which is a common consonant.
- The letter ""R"" and ""N"", both of which are top-frequency consonants.
- The vowels ""A"" and ""E"", which are among the most common vowels in 5-letter words.

This word uses 5 distinct letters, covering a broad range of possibilities and helping identify correct positions or misplaced letters efficiently. There’s no feedback yet since it’s the first turn, but this guess will provide valuable clues for subsequent moves.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from our first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"", E was the last letter, and it's marked as (-), meaning wrong position)

So from this, we know:
The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. It does contain E, but not as the last letter.

Now, since the word does not contain A and E was at the end in our guess but is misplaced, E must be in one of the first four positions.

We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

For our next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end. We know E cannot be the 5th letter.
2. Avoids using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Ideally, uses common letters that haven't been tested yet to maximize information.

We have only used one vowel: A (which was incorrect). But note, we have E in the word. We might need another vowel? The word must have E and possibly other vowels.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A, so the vowel possibilities are E (already present), I, O, U.

Common consonants: We also need consonants that haven't been tried. Remember, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

We've tried: C, R, A, N, E (E is in the word).

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is in the word, so we should include E.

Now, considering that E must be in one of positions 1,2,3, or4.

Since the feedback didn't give any ✓ (correct position), E is not in the 5th position, which we already know, and also none of C,R,A,N were in any position.

Now, we need a word that has E in either position 1,2,3, or4.

Let's think about common words with E not at the end.

For example:
- Words with E at the beginning: ELBOW, ECLAT (but C is eliminated?), ECLAT has C and we know C is not in the word, so avoid C.
So we must avoid C,R,A,N.

Let me think of words that avoid C,R,A,N and have E in a new position.

We also want to test other letters.

List of possible words that meet the criteria:
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, N
- Include E, not in last position (so position 1,2,3, or4)

First, E as the first letter? Words like:
  ELITE (but T and L) -> letters: E,L,I,T,E -> but E repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters? The secret word might have repeated letters? We should only use distinct letters for now to test more letters? But the feedback might not show duplicates well? Actually, it's okay, but we can avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Actually, 'ELITE' has two E's. But we can use it if we want. To avoid confusion, maybe use a word with distinct letters.

Possible words:
- With E in position 1: E (then avoid C,R,A,N). Examples: 
  EDIFY -> E,D,I,F,Y -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y. All distinct? E is once? Then not repeated? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N. So that's good.
- With E in position 2: For example, DEITY? But D, E, I, T, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N.
  However, in DEITY, E is in position 2? D-E-I-T-Y. Yes.
- With E in position 3: Example, BLUEP? Not common. Try SCEPT? But C in it. Better: THIEF -> T,H,I,E,F -> E in position 4? T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5). Then E is fourth? But we need E not last? Fourth is not last? The fifth is last. So that would be okay? E is in fourth? Then fifth is F. So E is not last? Yes.

Actually, position is 1-based: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.

In THIEF: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F. So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.

But in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.

But we don't know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can't test all at once.

Alternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.

Considering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.

For example, 'PIECE' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let's try distinct.

So possible words:
- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.
- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.

Important: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x?

Thus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.

Now, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.

Another word? 'TOWEL' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.

But E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.

Another word: 'HEIST' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.

Which one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.

HEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.

Similarly, 'SLEPT' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.

But SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.

HEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.

But S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Similarly, 'SHITE'? Not polite. Avoid that.

'FIELD': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.

Perhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.

I think HEIST is a good candidate: 
- H: tests a consonant
- E in position 2? But we don't know if that's correct; it's just to see.
- I: vowel
- S: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Similarly, 'DEIST' might be less common.

But HEIST is common.

Another word? 'QUEST' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.

Perhaps HEIST is better.

But let's consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it's at position 2.

Since we don't know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven't tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.

In HEIST, E is at position 2.

In EDIFY, E at 1.

So all are possibilities.

Words like:\n  ELITE (but T and L) -> letters: E,L,I,T,E -> but E repeated? We don\'t know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters? The secret word might have repeated letters? We should only use distinct letters for now to test more letters? But the feedback might not show duplicates well? Actually, it\'s okay, but we can avoid duplicates to test more letters.\n\nActually, \'ELITE\' has two E\'s. But we can use it if we want. To avoid confusion, maybe use a word with distinct letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- With E in position 1: E (then avoid C,R,A,N). Examples: \n  EDIFY -> E,D,I,F,Y -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y. All distinct? E is once? Then not repeated? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N. So that\'s good.\n- With E in position 2: For example, DEITY? But D, E, I, T, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N.\n  However, in DEITY, E is in position 2? D-E-I-T-Y. Yes.\n- With E in position 3: Example, BLUEP? Not common. Try SCEPT? But C in it. Better: THIEF -> T,H,I,E,F -> E in position 4? T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5). Then E is fourth? But we need E not last? Fourth is not last? The fifth is last. So that would be okay? E is in fourth? Then fifth is F. So E is not last? Yes.\n\nActually, position is 1-based: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.\n\nIn THIEF: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F. So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.\n\nBut in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.\n\nBut we don\'t know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can\'t test all at once.\n\nAlternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.\n\nConsidering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nSo let\'s think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.\n\nFor example, \'PIECE\' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let\'s try distinct.\n\nSo possible words:\n- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.\n- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.\n\nImportant: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x? Because E is in the word but not in position 5, so if we guess it at 5, it would be ""wrong position""? But in the feedback, since E is present, if we put E at a position where it\'s not, we get (-), meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position. Similarly, if we put E at a position that is correct, we get (✓).\n\nBut we don\'t know E\'s correct position yet. Therefore, we should avoid placing E in position 5 to avoid wasting the position for E? Because we know it cannot be there? And we want to test other letters.\n\nThus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.\n\nNow, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.\n\nAnother word? \'TOWEL\' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.\n\nBut E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.\n\nAnother word: \'HEIST\' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.\n\nWhich one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.\n\nHEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.\n\nSimilarly, \'SLEPT\' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.\n\nBut SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.\n\nHEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.\n\nBut S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.\n\nSimilarly, \'SHITE\'? Not polite. Avoid that.\n\n\'FIELD\': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.\n\nBut FIELD in word list? We are assuming it is valid.\n\nPerhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.\n\nAnother idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.\n\nI think HEIST is a good candidate: \n- H: tests a consonant\n- E in position 2? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct; it\'s just to see.\n- I: vowel\n- S: common consonant\n- T: common consonant\n\nSimilarly, \'DEIST\' might be less common.\n\nBut HEIST is common.\n\nAnother word? \'QUEST\' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.\n\nPerhaps HEIST is better.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it\'s at position 2.\n\nSince we don\'t know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven\'t tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.\n\nIn HEIST, E is at position 2.\n\nIn EDIFY, E at 1.\n\nIn THIEF? Earlier THIEF: T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5) -> E at 4.\n\nSo all are possibilities.\n\nI think HEIST is good because it uses S and T, which are highly common and give good coverage.\n\nSo let\'s go with HEIST.\n\nGuess: HEIST\n\nLetters: H, E, I, S, T.\n\nIf E is in position 2, we might get ✓ for E? But we don\'t know.\n\nIt might be better to choose a word where E is not the same position in case, but it\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: \'STOLE\' -> but O? And E at the last? Not allowed? E cannot be position 5? So if E is last, we cannot guess it? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong position? And it wastes a spot. Better to avoid.\n\nSo HEIST seems good.\n\nThus, my second guess: HEIST\n\nBut note: in HEIST, E is in position 2? Only after the H? We haven\'t tested any other positions.\n\nSo I will go with HEIST.Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-), we know:\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include E (since it is confirmed present), placed in any position except the 5th.\n- It should avoid any words containing C, R, A, or N (as they are eliminated).\n- The guess should focus on testing new letters, especially common consonants (e.g., S, T, L) or vowels (e.g., I, O, U) to gain more information.\n- ""HEIST"" is a strong candidate:\n  - It contains E in position 2 (to test a new position for E, as it was in position 5 last time).\n  - Letters H, I, S, and T are all untested and common in English words.\n  - No eliminated letters: avoids C, R, A, N.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possible words.\n\nThis guess aims to identify the correct position for E and gather feedback on other frequent letters.\n\n<guess>HEIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- This tells us:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
- Interpretation:
  - H is not in the word (x).
  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E(-) means incorrect position).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (since I(-) meaning present but wrong position).
  - S is not in the word (x).
  - T is not in the word (x).

So summarizing:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (so far).
- Confirmed present letters: E and I.
- Positions known:
  - E is not in position 2 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).
  - I is not in position 3.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

Present letters: E and I must be in the word. Since we know E in positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Wait, position 5 from guess1 (CRANE) and position 2 from guess2 (HEIST). So E cannot be at position 5 nor position 2? Yes.

Similarly, I is not in position 3.

The secret word has 5 letters, containing E and I, and no other of the letters we have guessed? Also, we don't know about repetition? But let's assume no repetition for now unless forced.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, N, H, S, T.
- Contains E and I.
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for E: now positions 1, 3, or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Yes: 5 from guess1 and 2 from guess2? So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 except 3? But when we place I, it must not be at position 3? And also, we have to consider E position.

Let's think of common letters left: We've tested many consonants: C, R, A, N, H, S, T are out. So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But vowels: A and E and I? A is out? A from previous guess? CRANE had A(x)? So A is not in the word. So vowels: E and I are present, so remaining vowels to try: O, U, and Y which can be a vowel? But Y sometimes vowel sometimes consonant? But we can use it.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, etc.

Now, the word must have E, I, and three other letters that are not C,R,A,N,H,S,T, and must be valid English words.

Possible words: 
- Position for E: 1,3,4? 
- Position for I: not 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

But we can't have both at the same position? Or we can? No? Because positions are distinct? Unless same letter? But E and I are different.

So let's think of words with E and I and avoiding forbidden letters.

For example:
- If E is in position 1: then words starting with E, and having I? Like ELITE? But ELITE has T and T is forbidden? T was in HEIST and got T(x)? So T is out.

Words must avoid T,S,H,C,R,A,N.

Now, words with E and I: e.g., OILED? But positions: O,I,L,E,D? Let's check letters: O,I,L,E,D. Now, O and L and D not forbidden? And letters: O,I,L,E,D.

In OILED:
- Position:1-O, 2-I, 3-L, 4-E, 5-D.

Then E is in position 4? Which is allowed? Since not position 2 or 5? Position 4 is new? Yes. I is in position 2? But I cannot be in position 2? We don't know? In feedback, I was at position 3 and got -, so I can be in other positions? The feedback doesn't say I cannot be in position 2? It only said position 3 is wrong? But it might be at position 2? Or other? So I is allowed at position 2? Unless we rule it out? But we tested I at position 3? So position 3 is wrong? But others are possible? Including position 2.

Similarly for E: position 2 wrong? But not others? So E can be at position 2? Wait no: from HEIST feedback: E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 2? So E cannot be in position 2? Because if it were, it would be ✓? But it's -, so not there? Therefore E is not at position 2? Similarly for I: not at position 3? So E cannot be in position 2? Position 2 is forbidden for E? In this word OILED, E is at position 4? So that's okay? And I is at position 2? Which has not been tested? So okay? We haven't guessed I at position 2? So it could be.

But let's see: OILED letters: O,I,L,E,D. Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, FIXED? But F,I,X,E,D? X might not common? Fixed: F,I,X,E,D? OILED is better? OilED has E and I? Yes.

Then feedback? We can guess OILED? But let's list words.

Another word: GUIDED? But duplicates? GUIDED: G,U,I,D,E,D? D repeated? Better distinct? But not necessary? However, feedback might handle duplicates? But it could be messy? We should avoid duplicates? To be safe? But the secret word might have duplicates? But since we have only 5 letters? Perhaps best to test distinct? But no rule says we must?

Since we are early? We can keep duplicates? But let's see? OILED: O,I,L,E,D — distinct. GUIDED: has D repeated? Less efficient? So OILED is better.

Another word: UPPER? But no I? Must have I? So we need E and I? Both present? So must include I and E.

Words like DEVIL? D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D,E,V,I,L? So E at position 2? But E cannot be at position 2? Because we got E(-) for position 2? So if E is at position 2 in DEVIL, but we know E is not in position 2? So DEVIL would have E in forbidden position? Therefore invalid? Because E at position 2 is known wrong? So we must avoid placing E in position 2? Similarly, cannot place I in position 3? So in our guess, we should put E in positions 1,3,4? And I in positions 1,2,4,5? But not put I in 3? And not E in 2 or 5? Position 5 for E is already forbidden? Position 2 forbidden, position 5 forbidden? From guess1: E not in 5? Guess2: E not in 2? So E must be in 1,3, or 4.

Similarly, I: must avoid position 3? From guess2 I(-) at position 3? So I cannot be in position 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

So for guess, word must:
- Have E in one of positions 1,3,4?
- Have I in any position except position 3?
- Contains no C,R,A,N,H,S,T (absent letters).

Possible words:
- OILED: O(1),I(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> E in position 4? Good? I in position 2? Also possible? And L and D not forbidden? Also O? O can be potential vowel? Yes.

But OILED: O, I, L, E, D.

Will this work? OILED seems okay? Yes.

Another word: POSY? Not 5 letters? Or FIELD? But F,I,E,L,D? F not forbidden? Positions: FIELD? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Then E in position 3? Allowed? Position 3 is not forbidden? I in position 2? Not forbidden? L and D not forbidden? Good? But FIELD? Then we have FIELD: F,I,E,L,D? Yes.

FIELD vs OILED: FIELD has E at position 3? Which is new position? Whereas OILED E at position 4? So different positions? But FIELD has I at position 2? Same as OILED? But position different.

Another word: BELIE? But E repeated? BELIE: B,E,L,I,E? Positions: B(1),E(2),L(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 2? Not allowed? Position 2 forbidden? So invalid? Because E cannot be at pos 2.

So BELIE not good.

Another: MOVIE? M,O,V,I,E? Positions: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 5? Not allowed? Position 5 forbidden? Because we know E not there? So E at 5 in MOVIE would be invalid? Correct. So avoid E at 5? So MOVIE not good.

Similarly, EXIST? But E at 1? X? Then S? But S forbidden? In HEIST we have S(x)? S not in word? So avoid S? Therefore EXIST has S? Forbidden.

Similarly, PIENS? Not common? And N forbidden? PIENS? N from CRANE? N(x)? Not in word? So avoid N? Also S forbidden? PIENS? S? Forbidden.

So back to FIELD or OILED.

FIELD: letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids? Yes. Positions: E at position 3? I at position 2? We haven't tested I at position 2? And E at position 3? So we can test them.

Similarly, OILED: O,I,L,E,D? E at position 4? I at position 2? Also tests O and L and D.

Which is better? FIELD tests F and L and D? OILED tests O and L and D? FIELD has F, which is less common? OILED has O, vowel? Might be useful? But both are okay? Or perhaps an option with different positions? But FIELD E at position 3? Which is new? Previously E at 5 and 2? So position 3 untested? Same for E position 4? Both good.

But FIELD has I at position 2? Which HEIST had I at position 3? But we can test position 2 for I? Because I might be there? Similarly, E at positions 3 or 4.

But we need more clues? Let's think about what positions remain.

Positions for E: 1,3,4? Position 1? We haven't tested? In CRANE, E at 5? HEIST at position 2? So E could be at position 1,3, or4? Similarly, I: could be at 1,2,4,5.

To cover possibility of E at position 1? We could consider a word starting with E? But E at start? For example, ""E"" + something? But E is vowel? Words like ELOPE? But O? L? E L O P E? But E repeated? Also O and P? Positions: E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> E at position 5? Which we cannot? Because not allowed? So invalid? If we do E? Not possible with E at start? Unless E is alone? But E at start and also end? Not efficient? Perhaps E as start? Example: ED? Not 5 letters. ECHO? But C forbidden? C not allowed? So E? Words starting with E? Avoiding forbidden letters? E, then? Like EDIFY? But H? Wait? EDIFY: E(1),D(2),I(3),F(4),Y(5) -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y? And avoids C,R,A,N,H,S,T? H forbidden? Yes? H is out? So okay? EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y? D,I,F,Y? All not forbidden? And Y?

In this word EDIFY: 
- E at position 1: which we haven't tested? 
- I at position 3: but I cannot be at position 3? Because from HEIST feedback, I was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning it's wrong position? So if we put I at position 3 again? Then feedback might be (-) again? Because it's still wrong? Or if E is at position 1? We get ✓? But I at position 3: since position 3 is wrong, if we put I at position 3, feedback will be (-) if I is present? Because it's wrong position? And we know I is present? But we already know pos3 wrong? So testing again? Wastes one position? Not efficient? So better to put I not at position 3? Similarly, not E not at position 2 or 5? So in EDIFY, putting I at position 3 is not advisable? Because we know that position is wrong? And the letter I should be elsewhere? So we should avoid position 3 entirely for I? Because it won't be correct? Similarly for E? Position 2 and 5 wrong? Avoid them? So let's rule: 
- For E: positions 1,3,4 available? But position 2 and 5 forbidden? So don't guess E at 2 or 5? Similarly, for I: positions 1,2,4,5? Position 3 forbidden? So avoid I at position 3? Therefore in our guess, we should put:
- E in position 1,3, or 4?
- And not in 2 or 5.
- I in position 1,2,4,5? And not in 3.

But guess EDIFY: E at position 1? Which is good? But I is at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for I? So please avoid? Therefore we cannot put I in position 3? So EDIFY invalid? Because if we guess EDIFY, I at position 3? But we know I cannot be there? So feedback will only tell us again wrong position? And waste? So let's avoid repeating the same wrong position? So EDIFY not good? Because of I at pos3? Wrong.

So back: FIELD? FIELD: positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)? So E at position 3? I at position 2? Both positions:
- E at position 3? Previously not tested? Because previous E positions: 5 in CRANE, 2 in HEIST? So position 3 untested? Good.
- I at position 2? Previously I was at position 3? So position 2 untested? Good.

Then FIELD? Letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, OILED: O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? Then E at position 4? Untested? I at position 2? Same? Position 3: L? And L not tested? So also OILED?

But FIELD: E at position 3, I at position 2? OILED: E at position 4, I at position 2? Position 2 same? But both valid.

Perhaps FIELD tests F? Which we haven't tried? And OILED tests O? Which is vowel? But FIELD might be more common? Letters: F,L,D? Common? Or O,L,D?

Also, we could consider ""NO"" words? But N forbidden? Or words with U? Like GUIDE? But E at end? GUIDE: G,U,I,D,E -> E at position 5? Not allowed? Forbidden? Since position 5 not correct? So avoid.

GUILD? No E? Must have E? So not?

WIELD? Like FIELD? Also W,I,E,L,D? Positions: W(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Similar to FIELD? W not forbidden? But W less common? FIELD better? WIELD: W not forbidden? But W is? WIELD: W, I, E, L, D.

Yes, but FIELD uses F? Both okay? But FIELD is more common? Similarly, YIELD? Y,I,E,L,D? Y position 1? Y,I,E,L,D? Also possible?

So choices: FIELD, OILED, WIELD, YIELD? Etc?

But we must choose one? FIELD? And get feedback?

But all are somewhat similar? Let's choose FIELD? Or OILED?

Since OILED has O? Which is a vowel? And FIELD? F is consonant? But we need vowels? The word has E and I? O is extra vowel? Could be? But not necessary? Since E and I are present? But vowels? Secret word may not have more than two? But English words usually have vowels? But not necessarily? For example, ""flyby"" has Y? But complicated.

Perhaps FIELD is good? Because L and D common? But OILED has O and L,D? O also common? But FIELD? I choose FIELD.

Thus, guess: FIELD.

To test E at position 3? Which might be correct? Or not? And I at position 2? Also possible? Plus letters F,L,D.

So <guess>FIELD</guess>? 

But let's confirm: feedback says I(-) meaning I is present but not position 3? And in FIELD? I at position 2? Which is different? So if I is in the word? And not position 3? Position 2 could be right? Or wrong? But we test it.

Similarly, E at position 3? Could be right? Or wrong? If wrong? We get different feedback.

Also, F,L,D new letters? Good.

So proceed.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: E is in the word but not in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: E and I are in the word but not in their guessed positions (E not in position 2, I not in position 3). H, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: E and I are in the secret word.
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- **Confirmed Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (these letters are not in the word).
- **Available Positions**:
  - E can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  - I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- **Untested Common Letters**: Focus on new letters like F, L, D, O, etc., to maximize information.
- **Word Selection Goal**: Test E and I in new positions while avoiding known absent letters. For this guess, ""FIELD"" is a strong choice:
  - Places E in position 3 (untested position for E).
  - Places I in position 2 (untested position for I).
  - Uses common letters F, L, D, which are untested and help cover vowel/consonant balance.
  - The word avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, H, S, T).

This guess aims to clarify the positions of E and I while efficiently narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.

<guess>FIELD</guess>",FIELD,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- This tells us:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
- Interpretation:
  - H is not in the word (x).
  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E(-) means incorrect position).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (since I(-) meaning present but wrong position).
  - S is not in the word (x).
  - T is not in the word (x).

So summarizing:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (so far).
- Confirmed present letters: E and I.
- Positions known:
  - E is not in position 2 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).
  - I is not in position 3.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

Present letters: E and I must be in the word. Since we know E in positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Wait, position 5 from guess1 (CRANE) and position 2 from guess2 (HEIST). So E cannot be at position 5 nor position 2? Yes.

Similarly, I is not in position 3.

The secret word has 5 letters, containing E and I, and no other of the letters we have guessed? Also, we don't know about repetition? But let's assume no repetition for now unless forced.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, N, H, S, T.
- Contains E and I.
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for E: now positions 1, 3, or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Yes: 5 from guess1 and 2 from guess2? So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 except 3? But when we place I, it must not be at position 3? And also, we have to consider E position.

Let's think of common letters left: We've tested many consonants: C, R, A, N, H, S, T are out. So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But vowels: A and E and I? A is out? A from previous guess? CRANE had A(x)? So A is not in the word. So vowels: E and I are present, so remaining vowels to try: O, U, and Y which can be a vowel? But Y sometimes vowel sometimes consonant? But we can use it.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, etc.

Now, the word must have E, I, and three other letters that are not C,R,A,N,H,S,T, and must be valid English words.

Possible words: 
- Position for E: 1,3,4? 
- Position for I: not 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

But we can't have both at the same position? Or we can? No? Because positions are distinct? Unless same letter? But E and I are different.

So let's think of words with E and I and avoiding forbidden letters.

For example:
- If E is in position 1: then words starting with E, and having I? Like ELITE? But ELITE has T and T is forbidden? T was in HEIST and got T(x)? So T is out.

Words must avoid T,S,H,C,R,A,N.

Now, words with E and I: e.g., OILED? But positions: O,I,L,E,D? Let's check letters: O,I,L,E,D. Now, O and L and D not forbidden? And letters: O,I,L,E,D.

In OILED:
- Position:1-O, 2-I, 3-L, 4-E, 5-D.

Then E is in position 4? Which is allowed? Since not position 2 or 5? Position 4 is new? Yes. I is in position 2? But I cannot be in position 2? We don't know? In feedback, I was at position 3 and got -, so I can be in other positions? The feedback doesn't say I cannot be in position 2? It only said position 3 is wrong? But it might be at position 2? Or other? So I is allowed at position 2? Unless we rule it out? But we tested I at position 3? So position 3 is wrong? But others are possible? Including position 2.

Similarly for E: position 2 wrong? But not others? So E can be at position 2? Wait no: from HEIST feedback: E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 2? So E cannot be in position 2? Because if it were, it would be ✓? But it's -, so not there? Therefore E is not at position 2? Similarly for I: not at position 3? So E cannot be in position 2? Position 2 is forbidden for E? In this word OILED, E is at position 4? So that's okay? And I is at position 2? Which has not been tested? So okay? We haven't guessed I at position 2? So it could be.

But let's see: OILED letters: O,I,L,E,D. Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, FIXED? But F,I,X,E,D? X might not common? Fixed: F,I,X,E,D? OILED is better? OilED has E and I? Yes.

Then feedback? We can guess OILED? But let's list words.

Another word: GUIDED? But duplicates? GUIDED: G,U,I,D,E,D? D repeated? Better distinct? But not necessary? However, feedback might handle duplicates? But it could be messy? We should avoid duplicates? To be safe? But the secret word might have duplicates? But since we have only 5 letters? Perhaps best to test distinct? But no rule says we must?

Since we are early? We can keep duplicates? But let's see? OILED: O,I,L,E,D — distinct. GUIDED: has D repeated? Less efficient? So OILED is better.

Another word: UPPER? But no I? Must have I? So we need E and I? Both present? So must include I and E.

Words like DEVIL? D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D,E,V,I,L? So E at position 2? But E cannot be at position 2? Because we got E(-) for position 2? So if E is at position 2 in DEVIL, but we know E is not in position 2? So DEVIL would have E in forbidden position? Therefore invalid? Because E at position 2 is known wrong? So we must avoid placing E in position 2? Similarly, cannot place I in position 3? So in our guess, we should put E in positions 1,3,4? And I in positions 1,2,4,5? But not put I in 3? And not E in 2 or 5? Position 5 for E is already forbidden? Position 2 forbidden, position 5 forbidden? From guess1: E not in 5? Guess2: E not in 2? So E must be in 1,3, or 4.

Similarly, I: must avoid position 3? From guess2 I(-) at position 3? So I cannot be in position 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

So for guess, word must:
- Have E in one of positions 1,3,4?
- Have I in any position except position 3?
- Contains no C,R,A,N,H,S,T (absent letters).

Possible words:
- OILED: O(1),I(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> E in position 4? Good? I in position 2? Also possible? And L and D not forbidden? Also O? O can be potential vowel? Yes.

But OILED: O, I, L, E, D.

Will this work? OILED seems okay? Yes.

Another word: POSY? Not 5 letters? Or FIELD? But F,I,E,L,D? F not forbidden? Positions: FIELD? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Then E in position 3? Allowed? Position 3 is not forbidden? I in position 2? Not forbidden? L and D not forbidden? Good? But FIELD? Then we have FIELD: F,I,E,L,D? Yes.

FIELD vs OILED: FIELD has E at position 3? Which is new position? Whereas OILED E at position 4? So different positions? But FIELD has I at position 2? Same as OILED? But position different.

Another word: BELIE? But E repeated? BELIE: B,E,L,I,E? Positions: B(1),E(2),L(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 2? Not allowed? Position 2 forbidden? So invalid? Because E cannot be at pos 2.

So BELIE not good.

Another: MOVIE? M,O,V,I,E? Positions: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 5? Not allowed? Position 5 forbidden? Because we know E not there? So E at 5 in MOVIE would be invalid? Correct. So avoid E at 5? So MOVIE not good.

Similarly, EXIST? But E at 1? X? Then S? But S forbidden? In HEIST we have S(x)? S not in word? So avoid S? Therefore EXIST has S? Forbidden.

Similarly, PIENS? Not common? And N forbidden? PIENS? N from CRANE? N(x)? Not in word? So avoid N? Also S forbidden? PIENS? S? Forbidden.

So back to FIELD or OILED.

FIELD: letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids? Yes. Positions: E at position 3? I at position 2? We haven't tested I at position 2? And E at position 3? So we can test them.

Similarly, OILED: O,I,L,E,D? E at position 4? I at position 2? Also tests O and L and D.

Which is better? FIELD tests F and L and D? OILED tests O and L and D? FIELD has F, which is less common? OILED has O, vowel? Might be useful? But both are okay? Or perhaps an option with different positions? But FIELD E at position 3? Which is new? Previously E at 5 and 2? So position 3 untested? Same for E position 4? Both good.

But FIELD has I at position 2? Which HEIST had I at position 3? But we can test position 2 for I? Because I might be there? Similarly, E at positions 3 or 4.

But we need more clues? Let's think about what positions remain.

Positions for E: 1,3,4? Position 1? We haven't tested? In CRANE, E at 5? HEIST at position 2? So E could be at position 1,3, or4? Similarly, I: could be at 1,2,4,5.

To cover possibility of E at position 1? We could consider a word starting with E? But E at start? For example, ""E"" + something? But E is vowel? Words like ELOPE? But O? L? E L O P E? But E repeated? Also O and P? Positions: E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> E at position 5? Which we cannot? Because not allowed? So invalid? If we do E? Not possible with E at start? Unless E is alone? But E at start and also end? Not efficient? Perhaps E as start? Example: ED? Not 5 letters. ECHO? But C forbidden? C not allowed? So E? Words starting with E? Avoiding forbidden letters? E, then? Like EDIFY? But H? Wait? EDIFY: E(1),D(2),I(3),F(4),Y(5) -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y? And avoids C,R,A,N,H,S,T? H forbidden? Yes? H is out? So okay? EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y? D,I,F,Y? All not forbidden? And Y?

In this word EDIFY: 
- E at position 1: which we haven't tested? 
- I at position 3: but I cannot be at position 3? Because from HEIST feedback, I was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning it's wrong position? So if we put I at position 3 again? Then feedback might be (-) again? Because it's still wrong? Or if E is at position 1? We get ✓? But I at position 3: since position 3 is wrong, if we put I at position 3, feedback will be (-) if I is present? Because it's wrong position? And we know I is present? But we already know pos3 wrong? So testing again? Wastes one position? Not efficient? So better to put I not at position 3? Similarly, not E not at position 2 or 5? So in EDIFY, putting I at position 3 is not advisable? Because we know that position is wrong? And the letter I should be elsewhere? So we should avoid position 3 entirely for I? Because it won't be correct? Similarly for E? Position 2 and 5 wrong? Avoid them? So let's rule: 
- For E: positions 1,3,4 available? But position 2 and 5 forbidden? So don't guess E at 2 or 5? Similarly, for I: positions 1,2,4,5? Position 3 forbidden? So avoid I at position 3? Therefore in our guess, we should put:
- E in position 1,3, or 4?
- And not in 2 or 5.
- I in position 1,2,4,5? And not in 3.

But guess EDIFY: E at position 1? Which is good? But I is at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for I? So please avoid? Therefore we cannot put I in position 3? So EDIFY invalid? Because if we guess EDIFY, I at position 3? But we know I cannot be there? So feedback will only tell us again wrong position? And waste? So let's avoid repeating the same wrong position? So EDIFY not good? Because of I at pos3? Wrong.

So back: FIELD? FIELD: positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)? So E at position 3? I at position 2? Both positions:
- E at position 3? Previously not tested? Because previous E positions: 5 in CRANE, 2 in HEIST? So position 3 untested? Good.
- I at position 2? Previously I was at position 3? So position 2 untested? Good.

Then FIELD? Letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, OILED: O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? Then E at position 4? Untested? I at position 2? Same? Position 3: L? And L not tested? So also OILED?

But FIELD: E at position 3, I at position 2? OILED: E at position 4, I at position 2? Position 2 same? But both valid.

Perhaps FIELD tests F? Which we haven't tried? And OILED tests O? Which is vowel? But FIELD might be more common? Letters: F,L,D? Common? Or O,L,D?

Also, we could consider ""NO"" words? But N forbidden? Or words with U? Like GUIDE? But E at end? GUIDE: G,U,I,D,E -> E at position 5? Not allowed? Forbidden? Since position 5 not correct? So avoid.

GUILD? No E? Must have E? So not?

WIELD? Like FIELD? Also W,I,E,L,D? Positions: W(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Similar to FIELD? W not forbidden? But W less common? FIELD better? WIELD: W not forbidden? But W is? WIELD: W, I, E, L, D.

Yes, but FIELD uses F? Both okay? But FIELD is more common? Similarly, YIELD? Y,I,E,L,D? Y position 1? Y,I,E,L,D? Also possible?

So choices: FIELD, OILED, WIELD, YIELD? Etc?

But we must choose one? FIELD? And get feedback?

But all are somewhat similar? Let's choose FIELD? Or OILED?

Since OILED has O? Which is a vowel? And FIELD? F is consonant? But we need vowels? The word has E and I? O is extra vowel? Could be? But not necessary? Since E and I are present? But vowels? Secret word may not have more than two? But English words usually have vowels? But not necessarily? For example, ""flyby"" has Y? But complicated.

Perhaps FIELD is good? Because L and D common? But OILED has O and L,D? O also common? But FIELD? I choose FIELD.

Thus, guess: FIELD.

To test E at position 3? Which might be correct? Or not? And I at position 2? Also possible? Plus letters F,L,D.

So <guess>FIELD</guess>? 

But let's confirm: feedback says I(-) meaning I is present but not position 3? And in FIELD? I at position 2? Which is different? So if I is in the word? And not position 3? Position 2 could be right? Or wrong? But we test it.

Similarly, E at position 3? Could be right? Or wrong? If wrong? We get different feedback.

Also, F,L,D new letters? Good.

So proceed.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: E is in the word but not in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: E and I are in the word but not in their guessed positions (E not in position 2, I not in position 3). H, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: E and I are in the secret word.
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- **Confirmed Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (these letters are not in the word).
- **Available Positions**:
  - E can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  - I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- **Untested Common Letters**: Focus on new letters like F, L, D, O, etc., to maximize information.
- **Word Selection Goal**: Test E and I in new positions while avoiding known absent letters. For this guess, ""FIELD"" is a strong choice:
  - Places E in position 3 (untested position for E).
  - Places I in position 2 (untested position for I).
  - Uses common letters F, L, D, which are untested and help cover vowel/consonant balance.
  - The word avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, H, S, T).

This guess aims to clarify the positions of E and I while efficiently narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.",Guess 3: FIELD -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback. 
We should choose a word that is likely to have common letters and good coverage of the alphabet to maximize information.

Commonly used starting words in wordle include words like 'CRANE', 'SLATE', 'TRACE', etc., because they contain common letters and have a balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

However, note that we are not limited to those, but I want a word with distinct letters if possible to cover more ground.

Let me think: one word that is often used is 'RAISE' because it has three vowels and two common consonants, but let's consider 'CRATE'. Alternatively, 'ROUSE' might be good too.

But note that the feedback tells us about:
- Correct position (✓)
- Present in word but wrong position (-)
- Absent (x)

So we want to test letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Another excellent starting word is 'AUDIO' which gets four vowels, but then we might miss consonants. Alternatively, we can use 'ADIEU' to get four vowels and 'D', but then we have two vowels repeated? Actually, 'ADIEU' has A, D, I, E, U. That's five distinct letters: two vowels? Wait, A, I, E, U are vowels and D is a consonant.

But we also want consonants. Another good one is 'CRANE'.

Considering a balance, I'll go with 'CRANE':

C: common consonant
R: common consonant
A: common vowel
N: common consonant
E: common vowel

So my first guess will be: CRANE

Let's output accordingly.For the first guess, I want to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters that frequently appear in English words. A good starting point is words that include frequent consonants and vowels. ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- The letter ""C"" which is a common consonant.
- The letter ""R"" and ""N"", both of which are top-frequency consonants.
- The vowels ""A"" and ""E"", which are among the most common vowels in 5-letter words.

This word uses 5 distinct letters, covering a broad range of possibilities and helping identify correct positions or misplaced letters efficiently. There’s no feedback yet since it’s the first turn, but this guess will provide valuable clues for subsequent moves.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from our first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is not in the secret word (x)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""CRANE"", E was the last letter, and it's marked as (-), meaning wrong position)

So from this, we know:
The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N. It does contain E, but not as the last letter.

Now, since the word does not contain A and E was at the end in our guess but is misplaced, E must be in one of the first four positions.

We have eliminated 4 letters: C, R, A, N. And we know E is present.

For our next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end. We know E cannot be the 5th letter.
2. Avoids using C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
3. Ideally, uses common letters that haven't been tested yet to maximize information.

We have only used one vowel: A (which was incorrect). But note, we have E in the word. We might need another vowel? The word must have E and possibly other vowels.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have eliminated A, so the vowel possibilities are E (already present), I, O, U.

Common consonants: We also need consonants that haven't been tried. Remember, we cannot use C, R, A, N.

We've tried: C, R, A, N, E (E is in the word).

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But E is in the word, so we should include E.

Now, considering that E must be in one of positions 1,2,3, or4.

Since the feedback didn't give any ✓ (correct position), E is not in the 5th position, which we already know, and also none of C,R,A,N were in any position.

Now, we need a word that has E in either position 1,2,3, or4.

Let's think about common words with E not at the end.

For example:
- Words with E at the beginning: ELBOW, ECLAT (but C is eliminated?), ECLAT has C and we know C is not in the word, so avoid C.
So we must avoid C,R,A,N.

Let me think of words that avoid C,R,A,N and have E in a new position.

We also want to test other letters.

List of possible words that meet the criteria:
- Avoid letters: C, R, A, N
- Include E, not in last position (so position 1,2,3, or4)

First, E as the first letter? Words like:
  ELITE (but T and L) -> letters: E,L,I,T,E -> but E repeated? We don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters? The secret word might have repeated letters? We should only use distinct letters for now to test more letters? But the feedback might not show duplicates well? Actually, it's okay, but we can avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Actually, 'ELITE' has two E's. But we can use it if we want. To avoid confusion, maybe use a word with distinct letters.

Possible words:
- With E in position 1: E (then avoid C,R,A,N). Examples: 
  EDIFY -> E,D,I,F,Y -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y. All distinct? E is once? Then not repeated? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N. So that's good.
- With E in position 2: For example, DEITY? But D, E, I, T, Y -> distinct, and avoids C,R,A,N.
  However, in DEITY, E is in position 2? D-E-I-T-Y. Yes.
- With E in position 3: Example, BLUEP? Not common. Try SCEPT? But C in it. Better: THIEF -> T,H,I,E,F -> E in position 4? T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5). Then E is fourth? But we need E not last? Fourth is not last? The fifth is last. So that would be okay? E is in fourth? Then fifth is F. So E is not last? Yes.

Actually, position is 1-based: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.

In THIEF: positions: 1-T, 2-H, 3-I, 4-E, 5-F. So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.

But in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.

But we don't know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can't test all at once.

Alternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.

Considering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

So let's think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.

For example, 'PIECE' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let's try distinct.

So possible words:
- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.
- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.

Important: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x? Because E is in the word but not in position 5, so if we guess it at 5, it would be ""wrong position""? But in the feedback, since E is present, if we put E at a position where it's not, we get (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Similarly, if we put E at a position that is correct, we get (✓).

But we don't know E's correct position yet. Therefore, we should avoid placing E in position 5 to avoid wasting the position for E? Because we know it cannot be there? And we want to test other letters.

Thus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.

Now, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.

Another word? 'TOWEL' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.

But E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.

Another word: 'HEIST' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.

Which one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.

HEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.

Similarly, 'SLEPT' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.

But SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.

HEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.

But S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.

Similarly, 'SHITE'? Not polite. Avoid that.

'FIELD': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.

But FIELD in word list? We are assuming it is valid.

Perhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.

I think HEIST is a good candidate: 
- H: tests a consonant
- E in position 2? But we don't know if that's correct; it's just to see.
- I: vowel
- S: common consonant
- T: common consonant

Similarly, 'DEIST' might be less common.

But HEIST is common.

Another word? 'QUEST' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.

Perhaps HEIST is better.

But let's consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it's at position 2.

Since we don't know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven't tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.

In HEIST, E is at position 2.

In EDIFY, E at 1.

In THIEF? Earlier THIEF: T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5) -> E at 4.

So all are possibilities.

I think HEIST is good because it uses S and T, which are highly common and give good coverage.

So let's go with HEIST.

Guess: HEIST

Letters: H, E, I, S, T.

If E is in position 2, we might get ✓ for E? But we don't know.

It might be better to choose a word where E is not the same position in case, but it's fine.

Another word: 'STOLE' -> but O? And E at the last? Not allowed? E cannot be position 5? So if E is last, we cannot guess it? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong position? And it wastes a spot. Better to avoid.

So HEIST seems good.

Thus, my second guess: HEIST

But note: in HEIST, E is in position 2? Only after the H? We haven't tested any other positions.

So I will go with HEIST.Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-), we know:
- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

For the next guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed present), placed in any position except the 5th.
- It should avoid any words containing C, R, A, or N (as they are eliminated).
- The guess should focus on testing new letters, especially common consonants (e.g., S, T, L) or vowels (e.g., I, O, U) to gain more information.
- ""HEIST"" is a strong candidate:
  - It contains E in position 2 (to test a new position for E, as it was in position 5 last time).
  - Letters H, I, S, and T are all untested and common in English words.
  - No eliminated letters: avoids C, R, A, N.
  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possible words.

This guess aims to identify the correct position for E and gather feedback on other frequent letters.

<guess>HEIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- This tells us:
  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
- Interpretation:
  - H is not in the word (x).
  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E(-) means incorrect position).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (since I(-) meaning present but wrong position).
  - S is not in the word (x).
  - T is not in the word (x).

So summarizing:
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (so far).
- Confirmed present letters: E and I.
- Positions known:
  - E is not in position 2 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).
  - I is not in position 3.

We have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.

Present letters: E and I must be in the word. Since we know E in positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Wait, position 5 from guess1 (CRANE) and position 2 from guess2 (HEIST). So E cannot be at position 5 nor position 2? Yes.

Similarly, I is not in position 3.

The secret word has 5 letters, containing E and I, and no other of the letters we have guessed? Also, we don't know about repetition? But let's assume no repetition for now unless forced.

We must form a 5-letter word that:
- Avoids C, R, A, N, H, S, T.
- Contains E and I.
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 3.

Possible positions for E: now positions 1, 3, or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Yes: 5 from guess1 and 2 from guess2? So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 except 3? But when we place I, it must not be at position 3? And also, we have to consider E position.

Let's think of common letters left: We've tested many consonants: C, R, A, N, H, S, T are out. So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But vowels: A and E and I? A is out? A from previous guess? CRANE had A(x)? So A is not in the word. So vowels: E and I are present, so remaining vowels to try: O, U, and Y which can be a vowel? But Y sometimes vowel sometimes consonant? But we can use it.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, etc.

Now, the word must have E, I, and three other letters that are not C,R,A,N,H,S,T, and must be valid English words.

Possible words: 
- Position for E: 1,3,4? 
- Position for I: not 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

But we can't have both at the same position? Or we can? No? Because positions are distinct? Unless same letter? But E and I are different.

So let's think of words with E and I and avoiding forbidden letters.

For example:
- If E is in position 1: then words starting with E, and having I? Like ELITE? But ELITE has T and T is forbidden? T was in HEIST and got T(x)? So T is out.

Words must avoid T,S,H,C,R,A,N.

Now, words with E and I: e.g., OILED? But positions: O,I,L,E,D? Let's check letters: O,I,L,E,D. Now, O and L and D not forbidden? And letters: O,I,L,E,D.

In OILED:
- Position:1-O, 2-I, 3-L, 4-E, 5-D.

Then E is in position 4? Which is allowed? Since not position 2 or 5? Position 4 is new? Yes. I is in position 2? But I cannot be in position 2? We don't know? In feedback, I was at position 3 and got -, so I can be in other positions? The feedback doesn't say I cannot be in position 2? It only said position 3 is wrong? But it might be at position 2? Or other? So I is allowed at position 2? Unless we rule it out? But we tested I at position 3? So position 3 is wrong? But others are possible? Including position 2.

Similarly for E: position 2 wrong? But not others? So E can be at position 2? Wait no: from HEIST feedback: E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 2? So E cannot be in position 2? Because if it were, it would be ✓? But it's -, so not there? Therefore E is not at position 2? Similarly for I: not at position 3? So E cannot be in position 2? Position 2 is forbidden for E? In this word OILED, E is at position 4? So that's okay? And I is at position 2? Which has not been tested? So okay? We haven't guessed I at position 2? So it could be.

But let's see: OILED letters: O,I,L,E,D. Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, FIXED? But F,I,X,E,D? X might not common? Fixed: F,I,X,E,D? OILED is better? OilED has E and I? Yes.

Then feedback? We can guess OILED? But let's list words.

Another word: GUIDED? But duplicates? GUIDED: G,U,I,D,E,D? D repeated? Better distinct? But not necessary? However, feedback might handle duplicates? But it could be messy? We should avoid duplicates? To be safe? But the secret word might have duplicates? But since we have only 5 letters? Perhaps best to test distinct? But no rule says we must?

Since we are early? We can keep duplicates? But let's see? OILED: O,I,L,E,D — distinct. GUIDED: has D repeated? Less efficient? So OILED is better.

Another word: UPPER? But no I? Must have I? So we need E and I? Both present? So must include I and E.

Words like DEVIL? D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D,E,V,I,L? So E at position 2? But E cannot be at position 2? Because we got E(-) for position 2? So if E is at position 2 in DEVIL, but we know E is not in position 2? So DEVIL would have E in forbidden position? Therefore invalid? Because E at position 2 is known wrong? So we must avoid placing E in position 2? Similarly, cannot place I in position 3? So in our guess, we should put E in positions 1,3,4? And I in positions 1,2,4,5? But not put I in 3? And not E in 2 or 5? Position 5 for E is already forbidden? Position 2 forbidden, position 5 forbidden? From guess1: E not in 5? Guess2: E not in 2? So E must be in 1,3, or 4.

Similarly, I: must avoid position 3? From guess2 I(-) at position 3? So I cannot be in position 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.

So for guess, word must:
- Have E in one of positions 1,3,4?
- Have I in any position except position 3?
- Contains no C,R,A,N,H,S,T (absent letters).

Possible words:
- OILED: O(1),I(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> E in position 4? Good? I in position 2? Also possible? And L and D not forbidden? Also O? O can be potential vowel? Yes.

But OILED: O, I, L, E, D.

Will this work? OILED seems okay? Yes.

Another word: POSY? Not 5 letters? Or FIELD? But F,I,E,L,D? F not forbidden? Positions: FIELD? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Then E in position 3? Allowed? Position 3 is not forbidden? I in position 2? Not forbidden? L and D not forbidden? Good? But FIELD? Then we have FIELD: F,I,E,L,D? Yes.

FIELD vs OILED: FIELD has E at position 3? Which is new position? Whereas OILED E at position 4? So different positions? But FIELD has I at position 2? Same as OILED? But position different.

Another word: BELIE? But E repeated? BELIE: B,E,L,I,E? Positions: B(1),E(2),L(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 2? Not allowed? Position 2 forbidden? So invalid? Because E cannot be at pos 2.

So BELIE not good.

Another: MOVIE? M,O,V,I,E? Positions: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 5? Not allowed? Position 5 forbidden? Because we know E not there? So E at 5 in MOVIE would be invalid? Correct. So avoid E at 5? So MOVIE not good.

Similarly, EXIST? But E at 1? X? Then S? But S forbidden? In HEIST we have S(x)? S not in word? So avoid S? Therefore EXIST has S? Forbidden.

Similarly, PIENS? Not common? And N forbidden? PIENS? N from CRANE? N(x)? Not in word? So avoid N? Also S forbidden? PIENS? S? Forbidden.

So back to FIELD or OILED.

FIELD: letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids? Yes. Positions: E at position 3? I at position 2? We haven't tested I at position 2? And E at position 3? So we can test them.

Similarly, OILED: O,I,L,E,D? E at position 4? I at position 2? Also tests O and L and D.

Which is better? FIELD tests F and L and D? OILED tests O and L and D? FIELD has F, which is less common? OILED has O, vowel? Might be useful? But both are okay? Or perhaps an option with different positions? But FIELD E at position 3? Which is new? Previously E at 5 and 2? So position 3 untested? Same for E position 4? Both good.

But FIELD has I at position 2? Which HEIST had I at position 3? But we can test position 2 for I? Because I might be there? Similarly, E at positions 3 or 4.

But we need more clues? Let's think about what positions remain.

Positions for E: 1,3,4? Position 1? We haven't tested? In CRANE, E at 5? HEIST at position 2? So E could be at position 1,3, or4? Similarly, I: could be at 1,2,4,5.

To cover possibility of E at position 1? We could consider a word starting with E? But E at start? For example, ""E"" + something? But E is vowel? Words like ELOPE? But O? L? E L O P E? But E repeated? Also O and P? Positions: E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> E at position 5? Which we cannot? Because not allowed? So invalid? If we do E? Not possible with E at start? Unless E is alone? But E at start and also end? Not efficient? Perhaps E as start? Example: ED? Not 5 letters. ECHO? But C forbidden? C not allowed? So E? Words starting with E? Avoiding forbidden letters? E, then? Like EDIFY? But H? Wait? EDIFY: E(1),D(2),I(3),F(4),Y(5) -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y? And avoids C,R,A,N,H,S,T? H forbidden? Yes? H is out? So okay? EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y? D,I,F,Y? All not forbidden? And Y?

In this word EDIFY: 
- E at position 1: which we haven't tested? 
- I at position 3: but I cannot be at position 3? Because from HEIST feedback, I was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning it's wrong position? So if we put I at position 3 again? Then feedback might be (-) again? Because it's still wrong? Or if E is at position 1? We get ✓? But I at position 3: since position 3 is wrong, if we put I at position 3, feedback will be (-) if I is present? Because it's wrong position? And we know I is present? But we already know pos3 wrong? So testing again? Wastes one position? Not efficient? So better to put I not at position 3? Similarly, not E not at position 2 or 5? So in EDIFY, putting I at position 3 is not advisable? Because we know that position is wrong? And the letter I should be elsewhere? So we should avoid position 3 entirely for I? Because it won't be correct? Similarly for E? Position 2 and 5 wrong? Avoid them? So let's rule: 
- For E: positions 1,3,4 available? But position 2 and 5 forbidden? So don't guess E at 2 or 5? Similarly, for I: positions 1,2,4,5? Position 3 forbidden? So avoid I at position 3? Therefore in our guess, we should put:
- E in position 1,3, or 4?
- And not in 2 or 5.
- I in position 1,2,4,5? And not in 3.

But guess EDIFY: E at position 1? Which is good? But I is at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for I? So please avoid? Therefore we cannot put I in position 3? So EDIFY invalid? Because if we guess EDIFY, I at position 3? But we know I cannot be there? So feedback will only tell us again wrong position? And waste? So let's avoid repeating the same wrong position? So EDIFY not good? Because of I at pos3? Wrong.

So back: FIELD? FIELD: positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)? So E at position 3? I at position 2? Both positions:
- E at position 3? Previously not tested? Because previous E positions: 5 in CRANE, 2 in HEIST? So position 3 untested? Good.
- I at position 2? Previously I was at position 3? So position 2 untested? Good.

Then FIELD? Letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Similarly, OILED: O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? Then E at position 4? Untested? I at position 2? Same? Position 3: L? And L not tested? So also OILED?

But FIELD: E at position 3, I at position 2? OILED: E at position 4, I at position 2? Position 2 same? But both valid.

Perhaps FIELD tests F? Which we haven't tried? And OILED tests O? Which is vowel? But FIELD might be more common? Letters: F,L,D? Common? Or O,L,D?

Also, we could consider ""NO"" words? But N forbidden? Or words with U? Like GUIDE? But E at end? GUIDE: G,U,I,D,E -> E at position 5? Not allowed? Forbidden? Since position 5 not correct? So avoid.

GUILD? No E? Must have E? So not?

WIELD? Like FIELD? Also W,I,E,L,D? Positions: W(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Similar to FIELD? W not forbidden? But W less common? FIELD better? WIELD: W not forbidden? But W is? WIELD: W, I, E, L, D.

Yes, but FIELD uses F? Both okay? But FIELD is more common? Similarly, YIELD? Y,I,E,L,D? Y position 1? Y,I,E,L,D? Also possible?

So choices: FIELD, OILED, WIELD, YIELD? Etc?

But we must choose one? FIELD? And get feedback?

But all are somewhat similar? Let's choose FIELD? Or OILED?

Since OILED has O? Which is a vowel? And FIELD? F is consonant? But we need vowels? The word has E and I? O is extra vowel? Could be? But not necessary? Since E and I are present? But vowels? Secret word may not have more than two? But English words usually have vowels? But not necessarily? For example, ""flyby"" has Y? But complicated.

Perhaps FIELD is good? Because L and D common? But OILED has O and L,D? O also common? But FIELD? I choose FIELD.

Thus, guess: FIELD.

To test E at position 3? Which might be correct? Or not? And I at position 2? Also possible? Plus letters F,L,D.

So <guess>FIELD</guess>? 

But let's confirm: feedback says I(-) meaning I is present but not position 3? And in FIELD? I at position 2? Which is different? So if I is in the word? And not position 3? Position 2 could be right? Or wrong? But we test it.

Similarly, E at position 3? Could be right? Or wrong? If wrong? We get different feedback.

Also, F,L,D new letters? Good.

So proceed.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: E is in the word but not in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: E and I are in the word but not in their guessed positions (E not in position 2, I not in position 3). H, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: E and I are in the secret word.
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).
- **Confirmed Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (these letters are not in the word).
- **Available Positions**:
  - E can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
  - I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- **Untested Common Letters**: Focus on new letters like F, L, D, O, etc., to maximize information.
- **Word Selection Goal**: Test E and I in new positions while avoiding known absent letters. For this guess, ""FIELD"" is a strong choice:
  - Places E in position 3 (untested position for E).
  - Places I in position 2 (untested position for I).
  - Uses common letters F, L, D, which are untested and help cover vowel/consonant balance.
  - The word avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, H, S, T).

This guess aims to clarify the positions of E and I while efficiently narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.

So E is fourth, not fifth, so okay.\n\nBut in our case, we can try E in different positions to see where it is.\n\nBut we don\'t know yet, so we should try a word that tests multiple positions? But we can\'t test all at once.\n\nAlternatively, we might pick a word that has E, plus other new letters.\n\nConsidering common letters: After vowels, common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nSo let\'s think about words containing E and avoiding C,R,A,N.\n\nFor example, \'PIECE\' has E repeated, not distinct. Avoid repetition? Not necessary, but let\'s try distinct.\n\nSo possible words:\n- EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y -> all distinct, E in position 1.\n- STOVE: S,T,O,V,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? S, T, O, V, E -> yes, E in last position? STOVE: S(1),T(2),O(3),V(4),E(5) -> E is last? But we cannot use last position? We know E is not in the last position from previous feedback? Yes, because in ""CRANE"" E was last and got - (wrong position), meaning E is not last. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, any word with E at the end is invalid for our second guess? Because we know E is not at position 5.\n\nImportant: We cannot guess a word that has E in position 5? Not necessarily? Actually, we could, but it would be a waste because we already know E is not there. The feedback for E would then be x? Because E is in the word but not in position 5, so if we guess it at 5, it would be ""wrong position""? But in the feedback, since E is present, if we put E at a position where it\'s not, we get (-), meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position. Similarly, if we put E at a position that is correct, we get (✓).\n\nBut we don\'t know E\'s correct position yet. Therefore, we should avoid placing E in position 5 to avoid wasting the position for E? Because we know it cannot be there? And we want to test other letters.\n\nThus, we should choose a word with E not in position 5.\n\nNow, back to EDIFY: E in position 1, and letters: E, D, I, F, Y.\n\nAnother word? \'TOWEL\' -> T,O,W,E,L -> E in position 4? T(1),O(2),W(3),E(4),L(5). Then E is fourth? Avoids C,R,A,N? T,O,W,E,L -> yes.\n\nBut E is not in position 5? Position 4 is okay? Yes.\n\nAnother word: \'HEIST\' -> H,E,I,S,T -> E in position 2? Avoids C,R,A,N. So H,E,I,S,T.\n\nWhich one gives more information? EDIFY: E, D, I, F, Y -> includes I (a vowel) and consonants D, F, Y.\n\nHEIST: H, E, I, S, T -> includes S and T, very common consonants.\n\nSimilarly, \'SLEPT\' but L? And S,L,E,P,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? P is included. SLEPT: S(1),L(2),E(3),P(4),T(5) -> E in position 3? And T last? But E position 3 is okay? Yes.\n\nBut SLEPT has E in position 3? Yes.\n\nHEIST: position 1-H? But H is less common than S? Perhaps HEIST is okay.\n\nBut S and T are high-frequency. So HEIST might be good: letters H, E, I, S, T.\n\nSimilarly, \'SHITE\'? Not polite. Avoid that.\n\n\'FIELD\': F,I,E,L,D -> avoids? F,I,E,L,D - no C,R,A,N. Letters: F, I, E, L, D -> distinct. E position 3? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5). Yes.\n\nBut FIELD in word list? We are assuming it is valid.\n\nPerhaps one of the best choices is HEIST because it contains S and T, which are common.\n\nAnother idea: Since we know E is in the word, we can also think of common words with E and popular vowels/consonants.\n\nI think HEIST is a good candidate: \n- H: tests a consonant\n- E in position 2? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct; it\'s just to see.\n- I: vowel\n- S: common consonant\n- T: common consonant\n\nSimilarly, \'DEIST\' might be less common.\n\nBut HEIST is common.\n\nAnother word? \'QUEST\' -> Q is not common, and U E together? But U not tested? QUEST: Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids? No C,R,A,N? But Q and U might be risk factors? We know E is in the word? But this tests Q and U.\n\nPerhaps HEIST is better.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback: we need to narrow down. Also, E position: in HEIST, it\'s at position 2.\n\nSince we don\'t know where E is, maybe we put it in a position we haven\'t tried? We tried E at position 5? No? In CRANE, E was position 5? So positions tested: only position 5 for E? So we need to test E in positions 1-4.\n\nIn HEIST, E is at position 2.\n\nIn EDIFY, E at 1.\n\nIn THIEF? Earlier THIEF: T(1),H(2),I(3),E(4),F(5) -> E at 4.\n\nSo all are possibilities.\n\nI think HEIST is good because it uses S and T, which are highly common and give good coverage.\n\nSo let\'s go with HEIST.\n\nGuess: HEIST\n\nLetters: H, E, I, S, T.\n\nIf E is in position 2, we might get ✓ for E? But we don\'t know.\n\nIt might be better to choose a word where E is not the same position in case, but it\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: \'STOLE\' -> but O? And E at the last? Not allowed? E cannot be position 5? So if E is last, we cannot guess it? Actually, we can, but we know it will be wrong position? And it wastes a spot. Better to avoid.\n\nSo HEIST seems good.\n\nThus, my second guess: HEIST\n\nBut note: in HEIST, E is in position 2? Only after the H? We haven\'t tested any other positions.\n\nSo I will go with HEIST.Based on the previous feedback from Guess 1: CRANE → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-), we know:\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, A, or N.\n- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include E (since it is confirmed present), placed in any position except the 5th.\n- It should avoid any words containing C, R, A, or N (as they are eliminated).\n- The guess should focus on testing new letters, especially common consonants (e.g., S, T, L) or vowels (e.g., I, O, U) to gain more information.\n- ""HEIST"" is a strong candidate:\n  - It contains E in position 2 (to test a new position for E, as it was in position 5 last time).\n  - Letters H, I, S, and T are all untested and common in English words.\n  - No eliminated letters: avoids C, R, A, N.\n  - Provides broad coverage to narrow down possible words.\n\nThis guess aims to identify the correct position for E and gather feedback on other frequent letters.\n\n<guess>HEIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n- This tells us:\n  - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.\n  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n- Interpretation:\n  - H is not in the word (x).\n  - E is in the word but not in position 2 (since E(-) means incorrect position).\n  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (since I(-) meaning present but wrong position).\n  - S is not in the word (x).\n  - T is not in the word (x).\n\nSo summarizing:\n- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (so far).\n- Confirmed present letters: E and I.\n- Positions known:\n  - E is not in position 2 or 5 (from guesses 1 and 2).\n  - I is not in position 3.\n\nWe have used letters: C, R, A, N, E, H, I, S, T.\n\nPresent letters: E and I must be in the word. Since we know E in positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Wait, position 5 from guess1 (CRANE) and position 2 from guess2 (HEIST). So E cannot be at position 5 nor position 2? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, I is not in position 3.\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters, containing E and I, and no other of the letters we have guessed? Also, we don\'t know about repetition? But let\'s assume no repetition for now unless forced.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word that:\n- Avoids C, R, A, N, H, S, T.\n- Contains E and I.\n- E cannot be in position 2 or 5.\n- I cannot be in position 3.\n\nPossible positions for E: now positions 1, 3, or 4? Since positions 2 and 5 are ruled out? Yes: 5 from guess1 and 2 from guess2? So E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 except 3? But when we place I, it must not be at position 3? And also, we have to consider E position.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters left: We\'ve tested many consonants: C, R, A, N, H, S, T are out. So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut vowels: A and E and I? A is out? A from previous guess? CRANE had A(x)? So A is not in the word. So vowels: E and I are present, so remaining vowels to try: O, U, and Y which can be a vowel? But Y sometimes vowel sometimes consonant? But we can use it.\n\nCommon letters: L, O, U, D, etc.\n\nNow, the word must have E, I, and three other letters that are not C,R,A,N,H,S,T, and must be valid English words.\n\nPossible words: \n- Position for E: 1,3,4? \n- Position for I: not 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nBut we can\'t have both at the same position? Or we can? No? Because positions are distinct? Unless same letter? But E and I are different.\n\nSo let\'s think of words with E and I and avoiding forbidden letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If E is in position 1: then words starting with E, and having I? Like ELITE? But ELITE has T and T is forbidden? T was in HEIST and got T(x)? So T is out.\n\nWords must avoid T,S,H,C,R,A,N.\n\nNow, words with E and I: e.g., OILED? But positions: O,I,L,E,D? Let\'s check letters: O,I,L,E,D. Now, O and L and D not forbidden? And letters: O,I,L,E,D.\n\nIn OILED:\n- Position:1-O, 2-I, 3-L, 4-E, 5-D.\n\nThen E is in position 4? Which is allowed? Since not position 2 or 5? Position 4 is new? Yes. I is in position 2? But I cannot be in position 2? We don\'t know? In feedback, I was at position 3 and got -, so I can be in other positions? The feedback doesn\'t say I cannot be in position 2? It only said position 3 is wrong? But it might be at position 2? Or other? So I is allowed at position 2? Unless we rule it out? But we tested I at position 3? So position 3 is wrong? But others are possible? Including position 2.\n\nSimilarly for E: position 2 wrong? But not others? So E can be at position 2? Wait no: from HEIST feedback: E(-) meaning E is present but not in position 2? So E cannot be in position 2? Because if it were, it would be ✓? But it\'s -, so not there? Therefore E is not at position 2? Similarly for I: not at position 3? So E cannot be in position 2? Position 2 is forbidden for E? In this word OILED, E is at position 4? So that\'s okay? And I is at position 2? Which has not been tested? So okay? We haven\'t guessed I at position 2? So it could be.\n\nBut let\'s see: OILED letters: O,I,L,E,D. Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, FIXED? But F,I,X,E,D? X might not common? Fixed: F,I,X,E,D? OILED is better? OilED has E and I? Yes.\n\nThen feedback? We can guess OILED? But let\'s list words.\n\nAnother word: GUIDED? But duplicates? GUIDED: G,U,I,D,E,D? D repeated? Better distinct? But not necessary? However, feedback might handle duplicates? But it could be messy? We should avoid duplicates? To be safe? But the secret word might have duplicates? But since we have only 5 letters? Perhaps best to test distinct? But no rule says we must?\n\nSince we are early? We can keep duplicates? But let\'s see? OILED: O,I,L,E,D — distinct. GUIDED: has D repeated? Less efficient? So OILED is better.\n\nAnother word: UPPER? But no I? Must have I? So we need E and I? Both present? So must include I and E.\n\nWords like DEVIL? D,E,V,I,L? Positions: D,E,V,I,L? So E at position 2? But E cannot be at position 2? Because we got E(-) for position 2? So if E is at position 2 in DEVIL, but we know E is not in position 2? So DEVIL would have E in forbidden position? Therefore invalid? Because E at position 2 is known wrong? So we must avoid placing E in position 2? Similarly, cannot place I in position 3? So in our guess, we should put E in positions 1,3,4? And I in positions 1,2,4,5? But not put I in 3? And not E in 2 or 5? Position 5 for E is already forbidden? Position 2 forbidden, position 5 forbidden? From guess1: E not in 5? Guess2: E not in 2? So E must be in 1,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, I: must avoid position 3? From guess2 I(-) at position 3? So I cannot be in position 3? So I can be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nSo for guess, word must:\n- Have E in one of positions 1,3,4?\n- Have I in any position except position 3?\n- Contains no C,R,A,N,H,S,T (absent letters).\n\nPossible words:\n- OILED: O(1),I(2),L(3),E(4),D(5) -> E in position 4? Good? I in position 2? Also possible? And L and D not forbidden? Also O? O can be potential vowel? Yes.\n\nBut OILED: O, I, L, E, D.\n\nWill this work? OILED seems okay? Yes.\n\nAnother word: POSY? Not 5 letters? Or FIELD? But F,I,E,L,D? F not forbidden? Positions: FIELD? F(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Then E in position 3? Allowed? Position 3 is not forbidden? I in position 2? Not forbidden? L and D not forbidden? Good? But FIELD? Then we have FIELD: F,I,E,L,D? Yes.\n\nFIELD vs OILED: FIELD has E at position 3? Which is new position? Whereas OILED E at position 4? So different positions? But FIELD has I at position 2? Same as OILED? But position different.\n\nAnother word: BELIE? But E repeated? BELIE: B,E,L,I,E? Positions: B(1),E(2),L(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 2? Not allowed? Position 2 forbidden? So invalid? Because E cannot be at pos 2.\n\nSo BELIE not good.\n\nAnother: MOVIE? M,O,V,I,E? Positions: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5)? But E at position 5? Not allowed? Position 5 forbidden? Because we know E not there? So E at 5 in MOVIE would be invalid? Correct. So avoid E at 5? So MOVIE not good.\n\nSimilarly, EXIST? But E at 1? X? Then S? But S forbidden? In HEIST we have S(x)? S not in word? So avoid S? Therefore EXIST has S? Forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, PIENS? Not common? And N forbidden? PIENS? N from CRANE? N(x)? Not in word? So avoid N? Also S forbidden? PIENS? S? Forbidden.\n\nSo back to FIELD or OILED.\n\nFIELD: letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids? Yes. Positions: E at position 3? I at position 2? We haven\'t tested I at position 2? And E at position 3? So we can test them.\n\nSimilarly, OILED: O,I,L,E,D? E at position 4? I at position 2? Also tests O and L and D.\n\nWhich is better? FIELD tests F and L and D? OILED tests O and L and D? FIELD has F, which is less common? OILED has O, vowel? Might be useful? But both are okay? Or perhaps an option with different positions? But FIELD E at position 3? Which is new? Previously E at 5 and 2? So position 3 untested? Same for E position 4? Both good.\n\nBut FIELD has I at position 2? Which HEIST had I at position 3? But we can test position 2 for I? Because I might be there? Similarly, E at positions 3 or 4.\n\nBut we need more clues? Let\'s think about what positions remain.\n\nPositions for E: 1,3,4? Position 1? We haven\'t tested? In CRANE, E at 5? HEIST at position 2? So E could be at position 1,3, or4? Similarly, I: could be at 1,2,4,5.\n\nTo cover possibility of E at position 1? We could consider a word starting with E? But E at start? For example, ""E"" + something? But E is vowel? Words like ELOPE? But O? L? E L O P E? But E repeated? Also O and P? Positions: E(1),L(2),O(3),P(4),E(5) -> E at position 5? Which we cannot? Because not allowed? So invalid? If we do E? Not possible with E at start? Unless E is alone? But E at start and also end? Not efficient? Perhaps E as start? Example: ED? Not 5 letters. ECHO? But C forbidden? C not allowed? So E? Words starting with E? Avoiding forbidden letters? E, then? Like EDIFY? But H? Wait? EDIFY: E(1),D(2),I(3),F(4),Y(5) -> letters: E,D,I,F,Y? And avoids C,R,A,N,H,S,T? H forbidden? Yes? H is out? So okay? EDIFY: E,D,I,F,Y? D,I,F,Y? All not forbidden? And Y?\n\nIn this word EDIFY: \n- E at position 1: which we haven\'t tested? \n- I at position 3: but I cannot be at position 3? Because from HEIST feedback, I was at position 3 and got (-)? Meaning it\'s wrong position? So if we put I at position 3 again? Then feedback might be (-) again? Because it\'s still wrong? Or if E is at position 1? We get ✓? But I at position 3: since position 3 is wrong, if we put I at position 3, feedback will be (-) if I is present? Because it\'s wrong position? And we know I is present? But we already know pos3 wrong? So testing again? Wastes one position? Not efficient? So better to put I not at position 3? Similarly, not E not at position 2 or 5? So in EDIFY, putting I at position 3 is not advisable? Because we know that position is wrong? And the letter I should be elsewhere? So we should avoid position 3 entirely for I? Because it won\'t be correct? Similarly for E? Position 2 and 5 wrong? Avoid them? So let\'s rule: \n- For E: positions 1,3,4 available? But position 2 and 5 forbidden? So don\'t guess E at 2 or 5? Similarly, for I: positions 1,2,4,5? Position 3 forbidden? So avoid I at position 3? Therefore in our guess, we should put:\n- E in position 1,3, or 4?\n- And not in 2 or 5.\n- I in position 1,2,4,5? And not in 3.\n\nBut guess EDIFY: E at position 1? Which is good? But I is at position 3? Position 3 is forbidden for I? So please avoid? Therefore we cannot put I in position 3? So EDIFY invalid? Because if we guess EDIFY, I at position 3? But we know I cannot be there? So feedback will only tell us again wrong position? And waste? So let\'s avoid repeating the same wrong position? So EDIFY not good? Because of I at pos3? Wrong.\n\nSo back: FIELD? FIELD: positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)? So E at position 3? I at position 2? Both positions:\n- E at position 3? Previously not tested? Because previous E positions: 5 in CRANE, 2 in HEIST? So position 3 untested? Good.\n- I at position 2? Previously I was at position 3? So position 2 untested? Good.\n\nThen FIELD? Letters F,I,E,L,D? Avoids all forbidden? C,R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, OILED: O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? Then E at position 4? Untested? I at position 2? Same? Position 3: L? And L not tested? So also OILED?\n\nBut FIELD: E at position 3, I at position 2? OILED: E at position 4, I at position 2? Position 2 same? But both valid.\n\nPerhaps FIELD tests F? Which we haven\'t tried? And OILED tests O? Which is vowel? But FIELD might be more common? Letters: F,L,D? Common? Or O,L,D?\n\nAlso, we could consider ""NO"" words? But N forbidden? Or words with U? Like GUIDE? But E at end? GUIDE: G,U,I,D,E -> E at position 5? Not allowed? Forbidden? Since position 5 not correct? So avoid.\n\nGUILD? No E? Must have E? So not?\n\nWIELD? Like FIELD? Also W,I,E,L,D? Positions: W(1),I(2),E(3),L(4),D(5)? Similar to FIELD? W not forbidden? But W less common? FIELD better? WIELD: W not forbidden? But W is? WIELD: W, I, E, L, D.\n\nYes, but FIELD uses F? Both okay? But FIELD is more common? Similarly, YIELD? Y,I,E,L,D? Y position 1? Y,I,E,L,D? Also possible?\n\nSo choices: FIELD, OILED, WIELD, YIELD? Etc?\n\nBut we must choose one? FIELD? And get feedback?\n\nBut all are somewhat similar? Let\'s choose FIELD? Or OILED?\n\nSince OILED has O? Which is a vowel? And FIELD? F is consonant? But we need vowels? The word has E and I? O is extra vowel? Could be? But not necessary? Since E and I are present? But vowels? Secret word may not have more than two? But English words usually have vowels? But not necessarily? For example, ""flyby"" has Y? But complicated.\n\nPerhaps FIELD is good? Because L and D common? But OILED has O and L,D? O also common? But FIELD? I choose FIELD.\n\nThus, guess: FIELD.\n\nTo test E at position 3? Which might be correct? Or not? And I at position 2? Also possible? Plus letters F,L,D.\n\nSo <guess>FIELD</guess>? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: feedback says I(-) meaning I is present but not position 3? And in FIELD? I at position 2? Which is different? So if I is in the word? And not position 3? Position 2 could be right? Or wrong? But we test it.\n\nSimilarly, E at position 3? Could be right? Or wrong? If wrong? We get different feedback.\n\nAlso, F,L,D new letters? Good.\n\nSo proceed.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: E is in the word but not in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: E and I are in the word but not in their guessed positions (E not in position 2, I not in position 3). H, S, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed Present Letters**: E and I are in the secret word.\n  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback).\n  - I cannot be in position 3 (from feedback).\n- **Confirmed Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T (these letters are not in the word).\n- **Available Positions**:\n  - E can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n  - I can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n- **Untested Common Letters**: Focus on new letters like F, L, D, O, etc., to maximize information.\n- **Word Selection Goal**: Test E and I in new positions while avoiding known absent letters. For this guess, ""FIELD"" is a strong choice:\n  - Places E in position 3 (untested position for E).\n  - Places I in position 2 (untested position for I).\n  - Uses common letters F, L, D, which are untested and help cover vowel/consonant balance.\n  - The word avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, H, S, T).\n\nThis guess aims to clarify the positions of E and I while efficiently narrowing down possible letters for the secret word.\n\n<guess>FIELD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: FIELD -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - Absent: C, R, A, N
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
  - Absent: H, S, T (adding to the absent list)
  - E is present but not in position 2.
  - I is present but not in position 3.

Guess 3: FIELD -> Feedback: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-)
  - Absent: F, L (so now absent: C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L)
  - I is correct at position 2! (so the second letter is I)
  - E is present but not in position 3 (since we got E(-) for position 3).
  - D is present but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as I. So position 2 is I.
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (and not in position 2 or 5, as previously known). So E must be in position 1 or 4? (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 2 is taken by I, so E cannot be at 2; and 3 and 5 are ruled out by feedback, so only positions 1 or 4 left for E).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we have new present letter: D.

So present letters: E, I (at position 2), and D.

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T, F, L.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we need to find the other two letters? We have E, I, D, and two more? But E and I are already placed? Not exactly: I is fixed at position 2, but E is not fixed? And D is present but not fixed.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? (could be E? or something else)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? (cannot be E, because E not at position 3? But we have E(-) for position 3? So E is not at position 3? And position 3 is not fixed? So it must be a new letter? Or D? But D is present? But we don't know position of D? D could be at position 3? But we have to see? But E cannot be at position 3? So position 3 is open for other letters? But D might be there? Or another letter.

Similarly, position 4: could be E? Or D? Or other?
Position 5: cannot be E? And D is not at position 5? So position 5 must be a new letter? Or one of the present? But we have E and D? E not at 5? D not at 5? So position 5 must be a new letter? Because the present letters are E, I, D? I is at position 2? So E and D are to be placed in positions 1,3,4? But position 3 cannot have E? So E must be at position 1 or 4? And D must be at one of the remaining? But position 3 is available for D? Or position 1 or 4? But if E is at position 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? Or if E at 4, D at 1 or 3? But position 3 is available? But we have to consider that there might be other letters? Because we have two more positions? Positions 1,3,4,5? But position 5 is not fixed? And we have two present letters E and D? But the word has 5 letters? So we have I at 2, and then positions 1,3,4,5? But we have only two more letters? E and D? But that would be only 4 letters? I, E, D, and one more? No: the word has 5 letters? We have I (at 2), E (somewhere), D (somewhere), and two more letters? Because we have 5 positions? So we need two more letters? Because E, I, D are three? So two more? But we have positions 1,3,4,5? Four positions? But we have only three letters? E, D, and one more? I is already at position 2? So positions: 1,3,4,5 need to be filled? With E, D, and two other letters? Because we have four positions? So we must have two additional letters? Yes.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Letters: E, D, and two more letters (let's call them X and Y) that are not in the absent list? And not I? Because I is already placed? But I is one letter? So the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding absent: C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L? And excluding I? But I is in the word? So available letters: B, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And also E and D are in the word? But E and D are already counted? So the two additional letters are from the available? And E and D are placed in two of the positions? But we have four positions? So we need to place E, D, and two new letters? Yes.

But we know E must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 2 is I? Position 3 cannot be E? Position 5 cannot be E? So E must be at 1 or 4? Similarly, D is present? But we don't know where? D cannot be at position 5? Because in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? So D not at position 5? So D must be at position 1,3, or4? But position 1 and 4 might be taken by E? So if E is at position 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? But position 4 might be taken? Or if E at 4, D at 1 or 3? And position 3 is available? Also, position 5 must be one of the new letters? And position 3 must be either D or a new letter? Or E? But E cannot be at position 3? So position 3 must be D or a new letter? Similarly, position 1 must be E or D or a new letter? But E can only be at 1 or 4? So let's list possibilities:

Case 1: E at position 1.
Then positions:
1: E
2: I
3: ? (cannot be E, so must be D or new letter? But D might be here? Or not? Also, we have D to place? So if E at 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? And position 5 must be a new letter? And the remaining position (if D at 3, then position 4 is new? Or if D at 4, then position 3 is new? And position 5 is new? So in this case, we have two new letters? One at position 3 or 4? And one at position 5? But we have four positions? Position 1: E, position 2: I, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?. But we have to place D and two new letters? So positions 3,4,5: one of them is D? And the other two are new? But D cannot be at position 5? So D must be at position 3 or 4? So if E at 1, then D at 3 or 4? And the other two positions: one of 3 or 4 (if D at 3, then position 4 is new? And position 5 is new? Or if D at 4, then position 3 is new? And position 5 is new? So in either case, positions 3,4,5: one D and two new letters? But we have only two new letters? So that works.

Similarly, case 2: E at position 4.
Then positions:
1: ? (must be D or new letter? But D can be here? Or new? Also, E at 4? So position 1: not E? Because E at 4? So position 1: D or new letter? Position 2: I? Position 3: ? (cannot be E? So D or new? But D might be here? Position 4: E? Position 5: ? (cannot be E or D? So must be new letter? Because D not at 5? And E not at 5? So position 5: new letter? And we have to place D? So D must be at position 1 or 3? And position 3: if not D, then new? And position 1: if not D, then new? But we have two new letters? So if D at position 1, then position 3 must be new? And position 5 new? If D at position 3, then position 1 must be new? And position 5 new? So again, positions 1,3,5: one D and two new letters? But position 1 and 3? And position 5? Yes.

So in summary:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- E must be at 1 or 4
- D must be at 1,3,4? But not 5? And not 2? So 1,3,4? But if E is at 1, then D cannot be at 1? So D at 3 or 4? Similarly, if E at 4, then D at 1 or 3? So D cannot be at the same position as E? So:
  - If E at 1: D at 3 or 4
  - If E at 4: D at 1 or 3

And position 5 must be a new letter? Because E and D cannot be at 5? And I is at 2? So position 5: one of the two new letters? And the other new letter must be at the remaining position? For example, if E at 1 and D at 3, then position 4 and 5: both new? But we have only two new letters? So position 4 and 5: new letters? Similarly, if E at 1 and D at 4, then position 3 and 5: new? But position 3: if not D, then new? Yes? Similarly for other cases.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits? And we have to choose from available letters: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And we know E and D are in the word? But we are guessing the positions? And the new letters.

For the guess, we should try to cover possibilities? But we have limited tries? We have 3 guesses left? Or 3 used? Total 6? So 3 left? So we can try to guess based on common words.

Also, from feedback, we have D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? So in our guess, we should not put D at position 5? But we know that? So avoid.

Now, let's think of common words with I at position 2? And containing E and D? And two other letters from available.

For example, if E at position 1: then word starts with E, then I at 2? Then position 3: D or new? Position 4: D or new? Position 5: new? But we need to form a word.

Common words with pattern: E I _ _ _

But with E at 1 and I at 2? And D in the word? And avoiding absent letters.

For example, ""EIDER""? E,I,D,E,R? But R is absent? R forbidden? So no.

""ELIDE""? But L absent? L forbidden? From FIELD feedback? L(x)? So absent? So no.

""EXIST""? But S and T absent? No.

""EDICT""? But C and T absent? No.

""OILED""? But O? And E at 4? Not E at 1? We are considering E at 1? So E at 1? Then ""E"" + I + ...? Like ""EIGHT""? But G,H? H absent? H forbidden? So no.

""E"" + I + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""T""? But H and T absent? No.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""M""? But O and M? And D? But position 3: D? Then position 4: O? Position 5: M? So EIDOM? Not a word? Or EIDOS? But S absent? No.

Perhaps E at 1 is not common? Let's consider E at position 4? Then pattern: _ I _ E _

And D at position 1 or 3? And position 5: new letter.

For example, if D at position 1: D I _ E _ ? Then words like ""DICEY""? But C absent? ""DINED""? But N absent? ""DIVED""? But V? And E at 4? D I V E D? But D repeated? And E at 4? But position 5: D? But D not at 5? Forbidden? So not? ""DIVED"" has D at 1 and 5? But position 5 D is forbidden? Because we know D not at 5? So invalid? Similarly, ""DIMES""? But S absent? ""DIGLE""? Not word.

If D at position 3: then pattern: _ I D E _ ? Then position 1: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And E at 4? So words like ""AIDED""? But A absent? ""BIDED""? But B? And E at 4? B I D E D? D repeated? And position 5 D forbidden? ""BIDET""? But T absent? ""SIDED""? S absent? ""WIDEN""? But W? And N absent? N forbidden? ""RIDES""? R and S absent? Not good.

Perhaps ""GUIDE""? But G U I D E? But E at position 5? Forbidden? Because E not at 5? So not.

""QUIET""? But Q U I E T? Then E at position 4? And T absent? T forbidden? So no.

""MOVIE""? But M O V I E? E at 5? Forbidden? No.

Perhaps we need to consider that the new letters are common? Like O, U, etc.

Another idea: perhaps E is at position 4? And D at position 1? Then word: D I ? E ? 

With ? at position 3 and 5? Position 3: must be a letter? And position 5: must be a letter? And avoid absent.

For example, ""DIOLE""? But O and L? L absent? ""DIODE""? But O and D repeated? And E at 4? D I O D E? Then position 5 E? But E at 5 forbidden? And D at 1 and 3? But position 3 O? Then D at 1? But position 5 E? Not allowed? So not.

""DIENE""? But E repeated? And N absent? No.

Perhaps ""DITTO""? But T and O? T absent? No.

Maybe E at position 1 is more likely? But we had trouble finding words? Let's list all possible words with I at position 2, and containing E and D, and avoiding absent letters.

Available letters for new: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: for pattern: ? I ? ? ?

With E and D in the word.

For example, ""PILED""? But L absent? L forbidden? ""WIPED""? W? But E at 4? W I P E D? D at 5? But D not at 5? Forbidden? So not.

""BIDET""? But T absent? ""JIVED""? J? V? E at 4? J I V E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""J I V E D"" has D at 5? Not allowed.

""GIVED""? Not word? ""GIVEN""? N absent? ""DIVER""? But D at 1? E at? D I V E R? R absent? ""D I V E R"" has E at 4? R at 5? But R absent? No.

Perhaps ""QUIET"" is not? T absent.

Another common word: ""TIMED""? But T at 1? T absent? ""LIMED""? L absent? ""MIMED""? M? E at 4? M I M E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""M I M E D"" has D at 5? Not allowed.

""OILED""? O I L E D? But L absent? L forbidden? From FIELD feedback? L(x)? So no.

""OUNCE""? But C? And no I at 2? Not.

Perhaps we missed a word? Like ""BIDE""? Not 5 letters? ""ABIDE""? A absent? ""GLIDE""? L absent? ""PRIDE""? P? R absent? R forbidden? ""BRIDE""? B? R absent? ""GRIDE""? Not common? ""TRIDE""? T absent? ""URINE""? U R I N E? R and N absent? No.

""UNITE""? U N I T E? N and T absent? No.

""UTILE""? U T I L E? T and L absent? No.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? But E at 5? Forbidden? ""O X I D E"" has I at 3? Not at 2? We need I at position 2.

Position 2 is I? So the word must have second letter I.

So words like ? I ? ? ?

With E and D in it? And not at forbidden positions? And avoiding absent letters.

Let's think of ""DIXIE""? D I X I E? But I repeated? And E at 5? Forbidden? ""D I X I E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""BIKED""? B I K E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""B I K E D"" has E at 4? D at 5? D at 5 not allowed.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? D at 5? Forbidden.

""VINED""? V I N E D? N absent? D at 5? Forbidden.

""WIDEN""? W I D E N? N absent? E at 4? D at 3? But N absent? No.

""GUIDE""? G U I D E? E at 5? Forbidden.

""GUILD""? No E? Must have E.

""QUIFF""? No E or D.

Perhaps ""DEICE""? D E I C E? But C absent? And I at position 3? Not 2? We need I at 2.

I think we have a problem? Maybe we missed that in the feedback, D is present? But in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? So D is present? But not at 5? But in the word, D must be somewhere? But we are not finding words? Perhaps the secret word has repeated letters? But we haven't considered that? For example, D repeated? But in FIELD, D was at position 5? And got (-)? So D is present? But not at 5? So if there is another D? But we don't know.

But in our guesses, we haven't tested for duplicates? But it's possible.

For example, the word could have two D's? But in FIELD, we guessed D at position 5? And got (-)? So if there is another D at position 1 or 3 or 4? It would be present? But we don't know if there is another D? The feedback for D(-) only says that there is a D in the word but not at position 5? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple D's? But in that case, position 5 could be D? But we got (-) for D at position 5? Which means that either there is no D at position 5, but there is at least one D elsewhere? So if there is another D, it's possible? But position 5 is not D? So if we have a word with D at position 5, it would be wrong? But we know that? So we avoid.

But for the secret word, it could have D at position 1 and another at position 3? For example? But we don't know.

But in our search, we are not finding many words? Let's list possible words with I at position 2, and containing E and D, and avoiding absent letters.

Available letters: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And E and D are in the word? But E and D are not in the available for new? They are already in the word? So the two new letters are from the available list.

So the word has letters: I (at 2), E, D, and two from B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with E, D, and two new letters? But with constraints on positions.

For example, position 1: can be E, D, or new letter.
Position 3: can be D or new letter (not E)
Position 4: can be E, D, or new letter
Position 5: can be new letter (not E or D)

But E must be at 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 must be E? Similarly, D must be at 1,3, or4? But not 5.

So let's assume E at position 1.

Then:
Position 1: E
Position 2: I
Position 3: D or new letter (say X)
Position 4: D or new letter (say Y) but if position 3 is D, then position 4 must be Y? Or if position 3 is X, then position 4 can be D or Y? But D must be somewhere? So if position 3 is not D, then position 4 must be D? Or position 1 is E, so D cannot be at 1? So D must be at 3 or 4? So:
- If position 3: D, then position 4: Y, position 5: Z
- If position 3: X, then position 4: D, position 5: Z

Similarly, if E at position 4:
Position 1: D or X
Position 2: I
Position 3: D or Y (but if position 1 is D, then position 3 must be Y? Or if position 1 is X, then position 3 can be D or Y? But D must be at 1 or 3? So:
- If position 1: D, then position 3: Y, position 4: E, position 5: Z
- If position 1: X, then position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: Z

Now, we need to find words that fit these patterns.

First, E at 1:
- Pattern 1: E I D Y Z? But Y at 4, Z at 5? What words? ""EID Y Z"" not common? ""EID"" is not a word? Like ""EIDER"" but R absent? No.
- Pattern 2: E I X D Z? With X at 3, D at 4, Z at 5? Words like ""E I X D Z""? Not common. ""EIGHT"" but G and H? H absent? No.

E at 4:
- Pattern 1: D I Y E Z? Words like ""D I Y E Z""? Not word. ""DICEY"" but C and E? C absent? ""D I Y E Z"" not a word.
- Pattern 2: X I D E Z? Words like ""X I D E Z""? Not common. ""BID E Z""? ""BIDEZ"" not word. ""VIDEO"" but V I D E O? O at 5? But pattern is X I D E Z, so position 5 Z? ""VIDEO"" has O at 5? But O is allowed? And V is available? ""VIDEO"" is a word? V I D E O? But position 2 is I? Yes. Letters: V, I, D, E, O? Avoid absent? V, I, D, E, O? Absent letters are C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L? V not in? O not in? I and E in? D in? So all good? And positions: position 1: V, position 2: I, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: O.

But in this case, E is at position 4? Which is allowed? D at position 3? Which is allowed? And O at position 5? New letter.

But in the feedback from FIELD, we have E(-) for position 3? But in this word, E is at position 4? So it should be fine? And D is at position 3? But in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? But here D is at position 3? So it could be correct? Or not? But we don't know yet.

Also, is ""VIDEO"" a valid word? Yes, 5-letter word.

But let's check the feedback constraints:
- E must not be at position 3? In VIDEO, E is at 4? Good.
- D must not be at position 5? In VIDEO, D is at 3? Good.
- I at position 2? Good.
- Letters: V, I, D, E, O? All not in absent list? V, O are new? I, D, E present? Good.

So VIDEO is a possible candidate.

But is there other words? For example, with E at position 1? But we couldn't find? Or with other patterns.

Another word: ""DIVINE""? But N absent? ""DEVIL"" but L absent? ""PIXIE""? P I X I E? I repeated? And E at 5? Forbidden? ""P I X I E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""BIOME""? B I O M E? E at 5? Forbidden? ""B I O M E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""QUIET""? Q U I E T? T absent? No.

""VOICE""? V O I C E? C absent? No.

So VIDEO seems a good guess? But let's confirm: in VIDEO, position 3 is D? And in FIELD, we had I at position 2 correct? E at position 3 wrong? But in VIDEO, position 3 is D? Not E? So it should be fine? And we can test it.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E at 5? Not allowed.

So I think VIDEO is a valid guess.

But in VIDEO, we have O at position 5? Which is new? And V at position 1? New.

So let's guess VIDEO.

But we have to make sure that it fits the feedback.

Previous feedback for FIELD: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-)

In VIDEO, we have V, I, D, E, O? So for the guess VIDEO, what would feedback be? We don't know yet? But it might be the word? Or not.

But we are guessing it.

So <guess>VIDEO</guess>

But let's see if there are other possibilities? For example, with E at position 1? Like ""E"" + I + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""T""? But H and T absent? No.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""M""? EIDOM? Not word.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""U"" + ""X""? EIDUX? Not word.

So VIDEO seems the only common word? Or ""BIDET"" but T absent? No.

Another word: ""WIDOW""? W I D O W? But no E? Must have E? So not.

""RADIO""? R and A absent? No.

So VIDEO is a good choice.

Thus, guess: VIDEO.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) → E is present but not in position 5. Absent letters: C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: H(x), E(-), I(-), S(x), T(x) → E and I are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. Absent letters: H, S, T.
   - **Guess 3 (FIELD)**: F(x), I(✓), E(-), L(x), D(-) → 
     - I is correct at position 2 (so the second letter is fixed as ""I"").
     - E is present but not in position 3.
     - D is present but not in position 5.
     - Absent letters: F, L.
   - **Cumulative Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T, F, L (9 letters eliminated).
   - **Present Letters**: E, I (fixed at position 2), and D.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **Position 2 is fixed as ""I""**.
   - **E must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from feedback). Thus, E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **D must be in the word** but cannot be in position 5 (from FIELD feedback). Thus, D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Position 5** cannot be E or D, so it must be a new letter.
   - The word must include **two additional letters** from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters: B, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Positional Analysis**:
   - **If E is in position 1**: D must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 1 is occupied by E). Position 5 must be a new letter, and the remaining position (3 or 4) must be the other new letter or D.
   - **If E is in position 4**: D must be in position 1 or 3. Position 5 must be a new letter, and the remaining position (1 or 3) must be the other new letter or D.
   - Given the constraints, common words like ""OILED"" (L is absent) or ""GUIDE"" (E in position 5 is invalid) are eliminated. After evaluating possibilities, ""VIDEO"" fits:
     - Positions: V (1), I (2), D (3), E (4), O (5).
     - E is in position 4 (allowed), D is in position 3 (allowed, not 5), and I is fixed at position 2.
     - New letters V and O are tested (not in absent list).
     - ""VIDEO"" is a valid 5-letter word that adheres to all feedback constraints.

4. **Why ""VIDEO""?**
   - Tests E in position 4 (a new position for E).
   - Tests D in position 3 (a new position for D).
   - Uses common letters V and O to maximize information gain.
   - Avoids all absent letters and respects positional feedback.
   - If correct, it could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify E/D positions and new letters.

<guess>VIDEO</guess>",VIDEO,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - Absent: C, R, A, N
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: HEIST -> Feedback: H(x) E(-) I(-) S(x) T(x)
  - Absent: H, S, T (adding to the absent list)
  - E is present but not in position 2.
  - I is present but not in position 3.

Guess 3: FIELD -> Feedback: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-)
  - Absent: F, L (so now absent: C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L)
  - I is correct at position 2! (so the second letter is I)
  - E is present but not in position 3 (since we got E(-) for position 3).
  - D is present but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as I. So position 2 is I.
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (and not in position 2 or 5, as previously known). So E must be in position 1 or 4? (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5; and 2 is taken by I, so E cannot be at 2; and 3 and 5 are ruled out by feedback, so only positions 1 or 4 left for E).
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we have new present letter: D.

So present letters: E, I (at position 2), and D.

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, H, S, T, F, L.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so we need to find the other two letters? We have E, I, D, and two more? But E and I are already placed? Not exactly: I is fixed at position 2, but E is not fixed? And D is present but not fixed.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? (could be E? or something else)
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: ? (cannot be E, because E not at position 3? But we have E(-) for position 3? So E is not at position 3? And position 3 is not fixed? So it must be a new letter? Or D? But D is present? But we don't know position of D? D could be at position 3? But we have to see? But E cannot be at position 3? So position 3 is open for other letters? But D might be there? Or another letter.

Similarly, position 4: could be E? Or D? Or other?
Position 5: cannot be E? And D is not at position 5? So position 5 must be a new letter? Or one of the present? But we have E and D? E not at 5? D not at 5? So position 5 must be a new letter? Because the present letters are E, I, D? I is at position 2? So E and D are to be placed in positions 1,3,4? But position 3 cannot have E? So E must be at position 1 or 4? And D must be at one of the remaining? But position 3 is available for D? Or position 1 or 4? But if E is at position 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? Or if E at 4, D at 1 or 3? But position 3 is available? But we have to consider that there might be other letters? Because we have two more positions? Positions 1,3,4,5? But position 5 is not fixed? And we have two present letters E and D? But the word has 5 letters? So we have I at 2, and then positions 1,3,4,5? But we have only two more letters? E and D? But that would be only 4 letters? I, E, D, and one more? No: the word has 5 letters? We have I (at 2), E (somewhere), D (somewhere), and two more letters? Because we have 5 positions? So we need two more letters? Because E, I, D are three? So two more? But we have positions 1,3,4,5? Four positions? But we have only three letters? E, D, and one more? I is already at position 2? So positions: 1,3,4,5 need to be filled? With E, D, and two other letters? Because we have four positions? So we must have two additional letters? Yes.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Letters: E, D, and two more letters (let's call them X and Y) that are not in the absent list? And not I? Because I is already placed? But I is one letter? So the other letters must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding absent: C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L? And excluding I? But I is in the word? So available letters: B, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And also E and D are in the word? But E and D are already counted? So the two additional letters are from the available? And E and D are placed in two of the positions? But we have four positions? So we need to place E, D, and two new letters? Yes.

But we know E must be in position 1 or 4? Because position 2 is I? Position 3 cannot be E? Position 5 cannot be E? So E must be at 1 or 4? Similarly, D is present? But we don't know where? D cannot be at position 5? Because in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? So D not at position 5? So D must be at position 1,3, or4? But position 1 and 4 might be taken by E? So if E is at position 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? But position 4 might be taken? Or if E at 4, D at 1 or 3? And position 3 is available? Also, position 5 must be one of the new letters? And position 3 must be either D or a new letter? Or E? But E cannot be at position 3? So position 3 must be D or a new letter? Similarly, position 1 must be E or D or a new letter? But E can only be at 1 or 4? So let's list possibilities:

Case 1: E at position 1.
Then positions:
1: E
2: I
3: ? (cannot be E, so must be D or new letter? But D might be here? Or not? Also, we have D to place? So if E at 1, then D can be at 3 or 4? And position 5 must be a new letter? And the remaining position (if D at 3, then position 4 is new? Or if D at 4, then position 3 is new? And position 5 is new? So in this case, we have two new letters? One at position 3 or 4? And one at position 5? But we have four positions? Position 1: E, position 2: I, position 3: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: ?. But we have to place D and two new letters? So positions 3,4,5: one of them is D? And the other two are new? But D cannot be at position 5? So D must be at position 3 or 4? So if E at 1, then D at 3 or 4? And the other two positions: one of 3 or 4 (if D at 3, then position 4 is new? And position 5 is new? Or if D at 4, then position 3 is new? And position 5 is new? So in either case, positions 3,4,5: one D and two new letters? But we have only two new letters? So that works.

Similarly, case 2: E at position 4.
Then positions:
1: ? (must be D or new letter? But D can be here? Or new? Also, E at 4? So position 1: not E? Because E at 4? So position 1: D or new letter? Position 2: I? Position 3: ? (cannot be E? So D or new? But D might be here? Position 4: E? Position 5: ? (cannot be E or D? So must be new letter? Because D not at 5? And E not at 5? So position 5: new letter? And we have to place D? So D must be at position 1 or 3? And position 3: if not D, then new? And position 1: if not D, then new? But we have two new letters? So if D at position 1, then position 3 must be new? And position 5 new? If D at position 3, then position 1 must be new? And position 5 new? So again, positions 1,3,5: one D and two new letters? But position 1 and 3? And position 5? Yes.

So in summary:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- E must be at 1 or 4
- D must be at 1,3,4? But not 5? And not 2? So 1,3,4? But if E is at 1, then D cannot be at 1? So D at 3 or 4? Similarly, if E at 4, then D at 1 or 3? So D cannot be at the same position as E? So:
  - If E at 1: D at 3 or 4
  - If E at 4: D at 1 or 3

And position 5 must be a new letter? Because E and D cannot be at 5? And I is at 2? So position 5: one of the two new letters? And the other new letter must be at the remaining position? For example, if E at 1 and D at 3, then position 4 and 5: both new? But we have only two new letters? So position 4 and 5: new letters? Similarly, if E at 1 and D at 4, then position 3 and 5: new? But position 3: if not D, then new? Yes? Similarly for other cases.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits? And we have to choose from available letters: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And we know E and D are in the word? But we are guessing the positions? And the new letters.

For the guess, we should try to cover possibilities? But we have limited tries? We have 3 guesses left? Or 3 used? Total 6? So 3 left? So we can try to guess based on common words.

Also, from feedback, we have D(-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? So in our guess, we should not put D at position 5? But we know that? So avoid.

Now, let's think of common words with I at position 2? And containing E and D? And two other letters from available.

For example, if E at position 1: then word starts with E, then I at 2? Then position 3: D or new? Position 4: D or new? Position 5: new? But we need to form a word.

Common words with pattern: E I _ _ _

But with E at 1 and I at 2? And D in the word? And avoiding absent letters.

For example, ""EIDER""? E,I,D,E,R? But R is absent? R forbidden? So no.

""ELIDE""? But L absent? L forbidden? From FIELD feedback? L(x)? So absent? So no.

""EXIST""? But S and T absent? No.

""EDICT""? But C and T absent? No.

""OILED""? But O? And E at 4? Not E at 1? We are considering E at 1? So E at 1? Then ""E"" + I + ...? Like ""EIGHT""? But G,H? H absent? H forbidden? So no.

""E"" + I + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""T""? But H and T absent? No.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""M""? But O and M? And D? But position 3: D? Then position 4: O? Position 5: M? So EIDOM? Not a word? Or EIDOS? But S absent? No.

Perhaps E at 1 is not common? Let's consider E at position 4? Then pattern: _ I _ E _

And D at position 1 or 3? And position 5: new letter.

For example, if D at position 1: D I _ E _ ? Then words like ""DICEY""? But C absent? ""DINED""? But N absent? ""DIVED""? But V? And E at 4? D I V E D? But D repeated? And E at 4? But position 5: D? But D not at 5? Forbidden? So not? ""DIVED"" has D at 1 and 5? But position 5 D is forbidden? Because we know D not at 5? So invalid? Similarly, ""DIMES""? But S absent? ""DIGLE""? Not word.

If D at position 3: then pattern: _ I D E _ ? Then position 1: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And E at 4? So words like ""AIDED""? But A absent? ""BIDED""? But B? And E at 4? B I D E D? D repeated? And position 5 D forbidden? ""BIDET""? But T absent? ""SIDED""? S absent? ""WIDEN""? But W? And N absent? N forbidden? ""RIDES""? R and S absent? Not good.

Perhaps ""GUIDE""? But G U I D E? But E at position 5? Forbidden? Because E not at 5? So not.

""QUIET""? But Q U I E T? Then E at position 4? And T absent? T forbidden? So no.

""MOVIE""? But M O V I E? E at 5? Forbidden? No.

Perhaps we need to consider that the new letters are common? Like O, U, etc.

Another idea: perhaps E is at position 4? And D at position 1? Then word: D I ? E ? 

With ? at position 3 and 5? Position 3: must be a letter? And position 5: must be a letter? And avoid absent.

For example, ""DIOLE""? But O and L? L absent? ""DIODE""? But O and D repeated? And E at 4? D I O D E? Then position 5 E? But E at 5 forbidden? And D at 1 and 3? But position 3 O? Then D at 1? But position 5 E? Not allowed? So not.

""DIENE""? But E repeated? And N absent? No.

Perhaps ""DITTO""? But T and O? T absent? No.

Maybe E at position 1 is more likely? But we had trouble finding words? Let's list all possible words with I at position 2, and containing E and D, and avoiding absent letters.

Available letters for new: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common combinations: for pattern: ? I ? ? ?

With E and D in the word.

For example, ""PILED""? But L absent? L forbidden? ""WIPED""? W? But E at 4? W I P E D? D at 5? But D not at 5? Forbidden? So not.

""BIDET""? But T absent? ""JIVED""? J? V? E at 4? J I V E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""J I V E D"" has D at 5? Not allowed.

""GIVED""? Not word? ""GIVEN""? N absent? ""DIVER""? But D at 1? E at? D I V E R? R absent? ""D I V E R"" has E at 4? R at 5? But R absent? No.

Perhaps ""QUIET"" is not? T absent.

Another common word: ""TIMED""? But T at 1? T absent? ""LIMED""? L absent? ""MIMED""? M? E at 4? M I M E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""M I M E D"" has D at 5? Not allowed.

""OILED""? O I L E D? But L absent? L forbidden? From FIELD feedback? L(x)? So no.

""OUNCE""? But C? And no I at 2? Not.

Perhaps we missed a word? Like ""BIDE""? Not 5 letters? ""ABIDE""? A absent? ""GLIDE""? L absent? ""PRIDE""? P? R absent? R forbidden? ""BRIDE""? B? R absent? ""GRIDE""? Not common? ""TRIDE""? T absent? ""URINE""? U R I N E? R and N absent? No.

""UNITE""? U N I T E? N and T absent? No.

""UTILE""? U T I L E? T and L absent? No.

""OXIDE""? O X I D E? But E at 5? Forbidden? ""O X I D E"" has I at 3? Not at 2? We need I at position 2.

Position 2 is I? So the word must have second letter I.

So words like ? I ? ? ?

With E and D in it? And not at forbidden positions? And avoiding absent letters.

Let's think of ""DIXIE""? D I X I E? But I repeated? And E at 5? Forbidden? ""D I X I E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""BIKED""? B I K E D? D at 5? Forbidden? ""B I K E D"" has E at 4? D at 5? D at 5 not allowed.

""PIKED""? P I K E D? D at 5? Forbidden.

""VINED""? V I N E D? N absent? D at 5? Forbidden.

""WIDEN""? W I D E N? N absent? E at 4? D at 3? But N absent? No.

""GUIDE""? G U I D E? E at 5? Forbidden.

""GUILD""? No E? Must have E.

""QUIFF""? No E or D.

Perhaps ""DEICE""? D E I C E? But C absent? And I at position 3? Not 2? We need I at 2.

I think we have a problem? Maybe we missed that in the feedback, D is present? But in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? So D is present? But not at 5? But in the word, D must be somewhere? But we are not finding words? Perhaps the secret word has repeated letters? But we haven't considered that? For example, D repeated? But in FIELD, D was at position 5? And got (-)? So D is present? But not at 5? So if there is another D? But we don't know.

But in our guesses, we haven't tested for duplicates? But it's possible.

For example, the word could have two D's? But in FIELD, we guessed D at position 5? And got (-)? So if there is another D at position 1 or 3 or 4? It would be present? But we don't know if there is another D? The feedback for D(-) only says that there is a D in the word but not at position 5? It doesn't say how many? So there could be multiple D's? But in that case, position 5 could be D? But we got (-) for D at position 5? Which means that either there is no D at position 5, but there is at least one D elsewhere? So if there is another D, it's possible? But position 5 is not D? So if we have a word with D at position 5, it would be wrong? But we know that? So we avoid.

But for the secret word, it could have D at position 1 and another at position 3? For example? But we don't know.

But in our search, we are not finding many words? Let's list possible words with I at position 2, and containing E and D, and avoiding absent letters.

Available letters: B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And E and D are in the word? But E and D are not in the available for new? They are already in the word? So the two new letters are from the available list.

So the word has letters: I (at 2), E, D, and two from B,G,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And positions: 1,3,4,5 to be filled with E, D, and two new letters? But with constraints on positions.

For example, position 1: can be E, D, or new letter.
Position 3: can be D or new letter (not E)
Position 4: can be E, D, or new letter
Position 5: can be new letter (not E or D)

But E must be at 1 or 4? So position 1 or 4 must be E? Similarly, D must be at 1,3, or4? But not 5.

So let's assume E at position 1.

Then:
Position 1: E
Position 2: I
Position 3: D or new letter (say X)
Position 4: D or new letter (say Y) but if position 3 is D, then position 4 must be Y? Or if position 3 is X, then position 4 can be D or Y? But D must be somewhere? So if position 3 is not D, then position 4 must be D? Or position 1 is E, so D cannot be at 1? So D must be at 3 or 4? So:
- If position 3: D, then position 4: Y, position 5: Z
- If position 3: X, then position 4: D, position 5: Z

Similarly, if E at position 4:
Position 1: D or X
Position 2: I
Position 3: D or Y (but if position 1 is D, then position 3 must be Y? Or if position 1 is X, then position 3 can be D or Y? But D must be at 1 or 3? So:
- If position 1: D, then position 3: Y, position 4: E, position 5: Z
- If position 1: X, then position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: Z

Now, we need to find words that fit these patterns.

First, E at 1:
- Pattern 1: E I D Y Z? But Y at 4, Z at 5? What words? ""EID Y Z"" not common? ""EID"" is not a word? Like ""EIDER"" but R absent? No.
- Pattern 2: E I X D Z? With X at 3, D at 4, Z at 5? Words like ""E I X D Z""? Not common. ""EIGHT"" but G and H? H absent? No.

E at 4:
- Pattern 1: D I Y E Z? Words like ""D I Y E Z""? Not word. ""DICEY"" but C and E? C absent? ""D I Y E Z"" not a word.
- Pattern 2: X I D E Z? Words like ""X I D E Z""? Not common. ""BID E Z""? ""BIDEZ"" not word. ""VIDEO"" but V I D E O? O at 5? But pattern is X I D E Z, so position 5 Z? ""VIDEO"" has O at 5? But O is allowed? And V is available? ""VIDEO"" is a word? V I D E O? But position 2 is I? Yes. Letters: V, I, D, E, O? Avoid absent? V, I, D, E, O? Absent letters are C,R,A,N,H,S,T,F,L? V not in? O not in? I and E in? D in? So all good? And positions: position 1: V, position 2: I, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: O.

But in this case, E is at position 4? Which is allowed? D at position 3? Which is allowed? And O at position 5? New letter.

But in the feedback from FIELD, we have E(-) for position 3? But in this word, E is at position 4? So it should be fine? And D is at position 3? But in FIELD, D was at position 5 and got (-)? But here D is at position 3? So it could be correct? Or not? But we don't know yet.

Also, is ""VIDEO"" a valid word? Yes, 5-letter word.

But let's check the feedback constraints:
- E must not be at position 3? In VIDEO, E is at 4? Good.
- D must not be at position 5? In VIDEO, D is at 3? Good.
- I at position 2? Good.
- Letters: V, I, D, E, O? All not in absent list? V, O are new? I, D, E present? Good.

So VIDEO is a possible candidate.

But is there other words? For example, with E at position 1? But we couldn't find? Or with other patterns.

Another word: ""DIVINE""? But N absent? ""DEVIL"" but L absent? ""PIXIE""? P I X I E? I repeated? And E at 5? Forbidden? ""P I X I E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""BIOME""? B I O M E? E at 5? Forbidden? ""B I O M E"" has E at 5? Not allowed.

""QUIET""? Q U I E T? T absent? No.

""VOICE""? V O I C E? C absent? No.

So VIDEO seems a good guess? But let's confirm: in VIDEO, position 3 is D? And in FIELD, we had I at position 2 correct? E at position 3 wrong? But in VIDEO, position 3 is D? Not E? So it should be fine? And we can test it.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" but E at 5? Not allowed.

So I think VIDEO is a valid guess.

But in VIDEO, we have O at position 5? Which is new? And V at position 1? New.

So let's guess VIDEO.

But we have to make sure that it fits the feedback.

Previous feedback for FIELD: F(x) I(✓) E(-) L(x) D(-)

In VIDEO, we have V, I, D, E, O? So for the guess VIDEO, what would feedback be? We don't know yet? But it might be the word? Or not.

But we are guessing it.

So <guess>VIDEO</guess>

But let's see if there are other possibilities? For example, with E at position 1? Like ""E"" + I + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""T""? But H and T absent? No.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""M""? EIDOM? Not word.

""E"" + I + ""D"" + ""U"" + ""X""? EIDUX? Not word.

So VIDEO seems the only common word? Or ""BIDET"" but T absent? No.

Another word: ""WIDOW""? W I D O W? But no E? Must have E? So not.

""RADIO""? R and A absent? No.

So VIDEO is a good choice.

Thus, guess: VIDEO.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) → E is present but not in position 5. Absent letters: C, R, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (HEIST)**: H(x), E(-), I(-), S(x), T(x) → E and I are present but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively. Absent letters: H, S, T.
   - **Guess 3 (FIELD)**: F(x), I(✓), E(-), L(x), D(-) → 
     - I is correct at position 2 (so the second letter is fixed as ""I"").
     - E is present but not in position 3.
     - D is present but not in position 5.
     - Absent letters: F, L.
   - **Cumulative Absent Letters**: C, R, A, N, H, S, T, F, L (9 letters eliminated).
   - **Present Letters**: E, I (fixed at position 2), and D.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **Position 2 is fixed as ""I""**.
   - **E must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from feedback). Thus, E must be in position 1 or 4.
   - **D must be in the word** but cannot be in position 5 (from FIELD feedback). Thus, D must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Position 5** cannot be E or D, so it must be a new letter.
   - The word must include **two additional letters** from the remaining alphabet (excluding absent letters: B, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Positional Analysis**:
   - **If E is in position 1**: D must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 1 is occupied by E). Position 5 must be a new letter, and the remaining position (3 or 4) must be the other new letter or D.
   - **If E is in position 4**: D must be in position 1 or 3. Position 5 must be a new letter, and the remaining position (1 or 3) must be the other new letter or D.
   - Given the constraints, common words like ""OILED"" (L is absent) or ""GUIDE"" (E in position 5 is invalid) are eliminated. After evaluating possibilities, ""VIDEO"" fits:
     - Positions: V (1), I (2), D (3), E (4), O (5).
     - E is in position 4 (allowed), D is in position 3 (allowed, not 5), and I is fixed at position 2.
     - New letters V and O are tested (not in absent list).
     - ""VIDEO"" is a valid 5-letter word that adheres to all feedback constraints.

4. **Why ""VIDEO""?**
   - Tests E in position 4 (a new position for E).
   - Tests D in position 3 (a new position for D).
   - Uses common letters V and O to maximize information gain.
   - Avoids all absent letters and respects positional feedback.
   - If correct, it could solve the word; if not, feedback will clarify E/D positions and new letters.",Guess 4: VIDEO -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) D(✓) E(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
