Alright, I'm playing a word game where I need to guess a 5-letter word in six tries. First, I need to pick a good starting word. For word games like this, starting with a word that has common letters can help eliminate possibilities quickly.

Letters like A, E, R, S, T are used frequently in English, so including some of those might be effective. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended. Let me think of a word that fits.

""CLEAR"" comes to mind; it uses C, L, E, A, R. That covers several vowels and common consonants. Alternatively, ""STARE"" uses S, T, A, R, E—also pretty solid. 

Hmm, maybe ""CRANE"" would be even better because it includes C, R, A, N, E. Checking common letters: E is the most common vowel, R and N are frequent consonants. Yeah, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong choice.

Using a word with repeated letters might not be ideal for the first guess since duplicates could complicate feedback. ""CRANE"" has all unique letters. That's another plus.  

So I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Okay, let's tackle this wordle puzzle step by step. Here's the feedback after my first guess ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is present but misplaced (-), N is absent (x), and E is present but misplaced (-). 

First, I need to absorb what this tells me. The letters C, R, and N aren't in the secret word at all. So I can eliminate those completely from consideration. Meanwhile, A and E are definitely in the word, just not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"" – A wasn't position 3, and E wasn't position 5.

Now, since I know A and E must appear somewhere, but not in spots 3 and 5. The absent letters also give me clues – eliminating C, R, N narrows things significantly. The secret word has five letters total, so I have A and E confirmed, and three unknown letters that are neither C, R, N, nor duplicates of A/E.

For my next guess, I want to test new positions for A and E while introducing new common vowels or consonants to probe more letters. I should avoid using eliminated letters. So no C, R, or N. 

A good second guess often incorporates known letters in new positions. Since A was incorrectly placed in position 3, it might be elsewhere – maybe position 1,2,4? Similarly, E was wrong at position 5, so perhaps slot it elsewhere. But I can't fix both yet since I have limited spots. 

I recall common vowels like I and O haven't been tested yet. Maybe I should include them. Letters like S, T, L are also common and untested. So perhaps a word like ""SLATE"" – but wait, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. That introduces S, L, T while repositioning A and E. Checking positions: A was guessed in slot 3 last time, now in slot 3 again? Not ideal – I should move it. If I put A in position 1 or 2, and E in position 4 or something.

Alternative words: How about ""SAUTE""? It has S, A, U, T, E. Positions: A in slot 2 (new position), E in slot 5 (same as before? But last feedback said E was misplaced at 5, so E shouldn't be at 5... Right? Last time E was guessed at position 5 and was misplaced (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can't be last position. So ""SAUTE"" puts E at position 5 again – that's foolish! I must avoid position 5 for E entirely.

Good catch – E cannot be at the end. Similarly, A cannot be in position 3. So for ""SAUTE"", E at 5 is invalid. Bad choice. 

Better option: ""SLATE"" places A at 3 again, which was wrong last time. So why retest the same? Perhaps ""LATTE"", but it was confirmed that the secret word has unique letters? I'm not sure if duplicates are allowed? Assuming no duplicates unless feedback indicates otherwise. So preferably all unique letters.

Proper words: What about ""STEAL""? Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, L5. This puts A in position 4 (new), E in position 3 (new). Neither repeats a tested position – last guess had A at 3 and E at 5, both now shifted. And it introduces S, T, L – all common letters. Sounds strategic. 

Let me verify: ""STEAL"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to take unlawfully. Yes. Letter composition checks out: unique letters, avoids C/R/N. Tests A and E in fresh spots. Covers S, T, L – likely frequent letters. Plus, if S turns out correct, it reveals critical info.

So I'll go with ""STEAL"" as my next guess.

<thinking>
The previous guess ""CRANE"" provided important clues:
- C, R, and N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: C, R, N. They cannot appear in the word.
2. Confirmed letters: A and E must appear somewhere, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
3. New positions for A and E must be tested.
4. Three unknown letters remain (since A and E account for two spots).
5. The word has five distinct letters (no duplicates indicated by feedback).

Strategy for next guess:
- Reposition A: Not position 3 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, or 4.
- Reposition E: Not position 5 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common consonants: S, T, L are high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoid eliminated letters C, R, N.

Good candidate word: ""STEAL""
- Positions: A is now at position 4 (a new position).
- Positions: E is now at position 3 (a new position).
- Introduces new letters: S, T, L.
- Uses confirmed letters A and E while respecting position constraints.
- Valid English word.

The secret word has five letters total, so I have A and E confirmed, and three unknown letters that are neither C, R, N, nor duplicates of A/E.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to test new positions for A and E while introducing new common vowels or consonants to probe more letters. I should avoid using eliminated letters. So no C, R, or N. \n\nA good second guess often incorporates known letters in new positions. Since A was incorrectly placed in position 3, it might be elsewhere – maybe position 1,2,4? Similarly, E was wrong at position 5, so perhaps slot it elsewhere. But I can\'t fix both yet since I have limited spots. \n\nI recall common vowels like I and O haven\'t been tested yet. Maybe I should include them. Letters like S, T, L are also common and untested. So perhaps a word like ""SLATE"" – but wait, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. That introduces S, L, T while repositioning A and E. Checking positions: A was guessed in slot 3 last time, now in slot 3 again? Not ideal – I should move it. If I put A in position 1 or 2, and E in position 4 or something.\n\nAlternative words: How about ""SAUTE""? It has S, A, U, T, E. Positions: A in slot 2 (new position), E in slot 5 (same as before? But last feedback said E was misplaced at 5, so E shouldn\'t be at 5... Right? Last time E was guessed at position 5 and was misplaced (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can\'t be last position. So ""SAUTE"" puts E at position 5 again – that\'s foolish! I must avoid position 5 for E entirely.\n\nGood catch – E cannot be at the end. Similarly, A cannot be in position 3. So for ""SAUTE"", E at 5 is invalid. Bad choice. \n\nBetter option: ""SLATE"" places A at 3 again, which was wrong last time. So why retest the same? Perhaps ""LATTE"", but it was confirmed that the secret word has unique letters? I\'m not sure if duplicates are allowed? Assuming no duplicates unless feedback indicates otherwise. So preferably all unique letters.\n\nProper words: What about ""STEAL""? Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, L5. This puts A in position 4 (new), E in position 3 (new). Neither repeats a tested position – last guess had A at 3 and E at 5, both now shifted. And it introduces S, T, L – all common letters. Sounds strategic. \n\nLet me verify: ""STEAL"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to take unlawfully. Yes. Letter composition checks out: unique letters, avoids C/R/N. Tests A and E in fresh spots. Covers S, T, L – likely frequent letters. Plus, if S turns out correct, it reveals critical info.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAL"" as my next guess.<thinking>\nThe previous guess ""CRANE"" provided important clues:\n- C, R, and N are NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).\n- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n1. Eliminated letters: C, R, N. They cannot appear in the word.\n2. Confirmed letters: A and E must appear somewhere, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.\n3. New positions for A and E must be tested.\n4. Three unknown letters remain (since A and E account for two spots).\n5. The word has five distinct letters (no duplicates indicated by feedback).\n\nStrategy for next guess:\n- Reposition A: Not position 3 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, or 4.\n- Reposition E: Not position 5 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Test new common consonants: S, T, L are high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.\n- Avoid eliminated letters C, R, N.\n\nGood candidate word: ""STEAL""\n- Positions: A is now at position 4 (a new position).\n- Positions: E is now at position 3 (a new position).\n- Introduces new letters: S, T, L.\n- Uses confirmed letters A and E while respecting position constraints.\n- Valid English word.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STEAL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So the secret word contains A and E, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively. Also, C, R, N are absent.

2. STEAL: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)
   - S and T are absent. E, A, L are present but not in their guessed positions.

From Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- Confirmed letters in the word: A, E, L (because A and E were already known from Guess 1, and now L is also confirmed present from Guess 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have three confirmed letters: A, E, L. There are two more letters we don't know yet.

Also, we have positional constraints:
- A is not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from STEAL, since STEAL has A at position 4 and feedback said A(-) meaning wrong position).
- E is not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from STEAL, since STEAL had E at position 3 and feedback E(-) meaning not at position 3).
- L is present but not at position 5 (from STEAL, L(-) at position 5).

The word has five positions. We know A, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions they haven't been tried.

Available positions: 1, 2, 4 (since A and E cannot be in 3 or 5, but note A can't be in 3 or 4, and E can't be in 3 or 5). Actually:
- A must be in 1, 2, or 5? But wait, in STEAL it was tried at 4 and was wrong, so A cannot be at 4. Also from CRANE we know A is not at 3. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5? But we also know that E is not at 5, and E is in the word, so position 5 is open for A? Yes, unless it's constrained otherwise.

Similarly, E cannot be at 3 or 5. So E must be at 1, 2, or 4.

L can be at any position except 5 (since tried and wrong in STEAL). So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

Now, we have two unknown letters to discover. We must choose a word that contains A, E, L and two new letters (since we haven't tried many). Also, avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We can focus on common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions carefully.

Let me list possible positions:

Position candidates:
- Position 1: could be A, E, L, or a new letter
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: cannot be A (tried in CRANE) or E (tried in STEAL) but L can be here? Or a new letter? Also note that position 3 is open for L or new letters.
- Position 4: cannot be A (tried in STEAL), but E can be here (it hasn't been tried at 4), L can be here, or new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (tried in CRANE), but A can be here? We haven't tried A at 5. L cannot be at position 5 (tried in STEAL). So position 5 can be A or a new letter.

So summary of constraints per position:
1: Any (A, E, L or new)
2: Any
3: Cannot be A or E (because A was tried at 3 in CRANE and was wrong, and E was tried at 3 in STEAL and was wrong). So position 3 must be L or a new letter.
4: Cannot be A (tried at 4 in STEAL and wrong) but can be E (not tried at 4) or L or new.
5: Cannot be E or L (E tried in CRANE and wrong, L tried in STEAL and wrong) so it can be A or a new letter.

So for the known letters:
A can be at: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out)
E can be at: 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are ruled out)
L can be at: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We know the word has exactly these three and two more unique letters.

We need to form a valid English word that includes A, E, L and two more letters (from the untested set) while respecting these positions.

We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let me brainstorm words that have A, E, L and two more consonants (since vowels are already included). Common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Consider if A is at 5: then words ending with A ... but many 5-letter words ending with A are not common? Also, E must be at 1,2,4 and L at 1,2,3,4.

Example: If A is at position 5, then the word ends with A.

Example words: 
- Maybe ""VIGIL"" but doesn't have A or E? Not having both.
- We need both A and E.

Alternative: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A.

For instance, A _ _ _ _

Then we need E and L somewhere.

Since position 3 cannot have A or E, it must be L or a new letter.

Similarly, position 5 must be A or new? But if A is at 1, then position 5 must be a new letter because we can't duplicate A (assuming unique letters as per feedback so far).

So if A is at 1, then positions:
1: A
2: ? (E, L, or new)
3: L or new (cannot be A or E)
4: ? (can be E, L, or new)
5: ? (must be new, since cannot be E or L, and A is already used)

So the word would be A followed by other letters.

Possible words: 
- AHEAD? But that has H, E, A, D. It has A at 1, E at 3? But position 3 cannot be E? Let's check: if A is at 1, then for ""AHEAD"": positions: A(1), H(2), E(3), A(4)? Wait, duplicate A? Also, A at 4 is not allowed? But in ""AHEAD"" it's A,H,E,A,D? Not valid? ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""AHEAD"" is A-H-E-A-D, so two A's? But that might be allowed? We don't know if duplicates are possible. The feedback so far didn't have any duplicate, but maybe the secret word can have duplicates? However, in CRANE and STEAL we had unique letters. Also, the rules don't say anything about duplicates. Let's recall: the secret word is a valid English word and could potentially have repeated letters? But I think we should assume it might until proven otherwise? However, in the absence of an indicator, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary.

But let me see: ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Yes, positions: 1:A, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A. That might complicate.

Moreover, position 3 is E, which we know cannot be position 3 (from STEAL feedback: E at position 3 was wrong). So E cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""AHEAD"" is impossible because it has E at 3.

Another word: ""ALIKE"" -> A(1), L(2), I(3), K(4), E(5). But E cannot be at position 5? (from CRANE). Also, position 3 is I, which is okay? But E at 5 is disallowed? So invalid.

How about ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed. Similarly.

So maybe A at 1 is tricky? I need A in a different position?

Next possibility: A at position 2?

Then the word: _ A _ _ _

Constraints:
Position 1: new letter or E or L? E or L can be at 1.
Position 2: A
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: can be E, L, new
Position 5: must be new (cannot be E or L, and A is already at 2)

So possible: _ A (L or new) (E/or L/or new) (new)

We also have to include E and L.

For example, if position 3 is L, then position 4 can be E? Then we have: _ A L E ? But position 5 must be new.

Words: ""BALED"" -> B, A, L, E, D. Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5).

Check constraints:
- Position 3: L -> allowed? Position 3 is allowed for L? Yes, since position 3 can be L or new. 
- Position 4: E -> allowed? Position 4 can be E? Yes, we haven't tried E at position 4? Correct.
- Position 5: D -> new letter and not prohibited? Yes.

Also, A at 2 is new? We haven't tried A at 2 before? Correct.

The word ""BALED"" is valid? Yes, meaning to have thrown out in a bundle? Or past tense of bale.

Also, letters: B, A, L, E, D. We introduce B and D, which haven't been tested.

Now, constraints for E: in ""BALED"", E is at position 4. We know E cannot be at 3 or 5, but 4 is okay? Yes. Similarly, A is at 2, which wasn't tried before. L is at 3, and we know it must not be at 5, but 3 is okay.

For A: we knew it couldn't be at 3 or 4, and here it's at 2? That's allowed.

Also, E is not at 3 or 5? At position 4, which is acceptable.

L is at 3? We didn't have constraint on L at 3? Only that it can't be at 5? So position 3 is acceptable? Yes.

So ""BALED"" seems promising.

Are there other possibilities? Another candidate: If we place A at position 5? Then the word ends with A.

It would be _ _ _ _ A

Constraints:
Position 1: new/E/L
Position 2: new/E/L
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: must be E, L, or new (cannot be A since A is at 5? Or duplicate? But we don't know if duplicated allowed). Let's assume unique letters to avoid complexity? Though feedback didn't indicate duplicates, so maybe the secret word has unique letters? In STEAL both A and E were present and we guessed them without duplicate issues? I think it's safe to assume unique letters until hinted otherwise? Therefore, A at 5 means other positions cannot have A.

Similarly, E must be at 1,2, or4? But position 4? Also L somewhere.

But position 4 cannot be E if E is elsewhere? Not necessarily.

But position 5 is A? Then position 4: can be E? Yes? Then we have ... E A at the end? Like some words?

Example: ""HYENA"" -> H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5). But E at position 3 is disallowed? And also N is eliminated? N is absent? So not valid.

Another: ""PANEL"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5). But N is absent? Also E at 4 is okay? But L at 5 is disallowed. And A at 2? Also, N is out? So no.

""OWE L A"" ... hard to find a word ending with A that has E and L without the eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""VODKA"" ... but no E? We need E.

So maybe focusing on A at 2 is better.

Back to ""BALED"" as a candidate.

Another word: if we place A at 1? It was problematic because position 3 and 5 constraints.

But what if L is at position 3? And E at 4? Then for position 1: must be new. Position 2: must be new? Because A at 1, so position 2: new, E or L? But E and L are at 4 and 3? So position 2 is new? Then the word: (new) (new) L E (new). And A at 1? That's A (new) L E (new). E is at position 4? That's okay? But position 5: new letter.

Word: A _ L E _

Need a letter for position 2 and 5? Common: ""APPLE"" but has P twice? And A at 1. But P and L,E? But no, ""APPLE"" has duplicate P? Also, ""ABLED"" -> A, B, L, E, D. But we already have ""BALED"" with similar.

""ABLED"": A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4? Valid? And L at 3? Valid? However, A at 1? Also, position 3 is L? Which is fine? Then position 5: D? Fine.

But we need to check the constraints? For A: we know from CRANE and STEAL feedback that A is not position 3 or 4? But position 1 hasn't been tried? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not tried at position 4? Okay? And L at 3? Okay? Position 5: D? Okay.

Then why choose between ""BALED"" and ""ABLED""?

""BALED"" has A at position 2 (we haven't ruled out position 2 for A? Actually, we only ruled out positions 3 and 4? So position 2 is open? Yes) and ""ABLED"" has A at position 1? Also open position.

Both seem possible? It gives information about A at position 1 or 2.

But let's think about which one introduces more common letters? Both introduce B and D? Same letters except order.

Also, consider frequency? Or perhaps I can pick one with more coverage?

Another possibility: place E at position 2? But I have limited guesses? Better to go with something.

Another word: ""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D. Positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But E at 3 is disallowed? And A at 4 is disallowed? So invalid.

""LEAVE"" but two E's? And A? And E at 5? Disallowed? Etc.

So back to ""BALED"" or ""ABLED"". Both use A, E, L and introduce B and D.

Which one? Maybe ""BALED"" because I want to know if A can be at 2? While with ""ABLED"" A is at 1? Both are untested positions.

Alternatively, I can think of a word that uses different new letters? For example, instead of B and D, use K and M? But B and D are common? So why not.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but T is absent? From STEAL, we know T is absent? So invalid? T is not in the word? Yes.

""MAPLE"" has M, A, P, L, E? Positions: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed? Invalid.

""GAZED"" has E at 5? Invalid.

So ""BALED"" and ""ABLED"" are both okay? Since we need to include E and L, with E not at 5? In both, E is at position 4? Which is okay? And L at position 3 in ABLED, or position 3 in BALED? BALED: positions are B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). ABLED: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So same letters, slightly different positions? But I must choose one.

Perhaps ""ABLED"" is not a word? No, ""abled"" is not common? Actually, ""ABLED"" is a valid word? It can be an adjective meaning having certain abilities? Or part of ""enabled""? But it's accepted in Wordle? I think.

To avoid controversy, I can choose ""BALED"". Also, it starts with B? Or ABLED starts with A? Since A is a vowel? But not that important.

A consideration: if I use ABLED, then A at 1 might be correct? But let's see what information we get?

With BALED: if the secret word does / does not have B or D? Or positions.

Similarly for ABLED.

I think BALED is fine.

Another possibility: ""FIELD"" but no E? And has E? F,I,E,L,D? But we don't have I? Also E at position 3? Disallowed? Pos: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5). E at 3 disallowed? And A is missing? So no.

""YIELD"" same, missing A.

So I think BALED is a good option.

But let me check if there are other words? Suppose we place E at position 1? Then word starts with E? Constraints: E cannot be at 3 or 5? But position 1 is okay? Then E _ _ _ _

Position 3: must be L or new? Cannot be A or E? Position 4: cannot be A? Position 5: cannot be E or L? So must be new? And A must be at ?, say position 2? A cannot be at 3 or 4? So position 2? Then: E A (L or new) (not A? So new or E or L? But E at 4?) Then E A ? ? ? 

With L: E A L ? ?

Then position 4: say E? Cannot, duplicate? L? Then E A L L? Duplicate? Or new? And position 5: new. Word: E A L (new) (new). Is there such a word? Like ""EAGLE""? E A G L E? But duplicate E? And E at position 5 disallowed? Also, L at 4? And G? But ends with E? Disallowed? Otherwise ""EAL"" something? Not easy.

""EARLY"" has R? Eliminated? R is absent? From CRANE so no.

So difficult? Therefore, ""BALED"" seems solid.

Thus, I'll go with ""BALED"" as my third guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-) → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5. C, R, N are absent.
- **STEAL**: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-) → E, A, L are in the word but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively. S and T are absent.

### Key deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A, E, L (since both guesses show their presence).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).
3. **Positional constraints**:
   - A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
   - E cannot be at position 3 (from STEAL) or position 5 (from CRANE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
   - L cannot be at position 5 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Unknowns**: Two additional letters are needed, which must not be C, R, N, S, T. Common untested letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.
5. **Word structure**: A valid 5-letter English word containing A, E, L and two new letters, respecting position constraints. No duplicates implied from feedback.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test repositioning of A, E, and L while introducing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D) to cover more ground.
- Choose a word that:
  - Puts A in an untested position (1, 2, or 5).
  - Puts E in an untested position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Puts L in an untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4, avoiding 5).
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, S, T).
- Candidate word: **BALED**
  - Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)
  - A at position 2: Allowed (not ruled out).
  - E at position 4: Allowed (not tested before).
  - L at position 3: Allowed (not ruled out, avoids position 5).
  - Introduces new letters: B and D (both untested).
  - Valid English word (meaning: past tense of bale).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints and covers potential vowels/consonants for the remaining unknown positions.

<guess>BALED</guess>",BALED,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So the secret word contains A and E, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively. Also, C, R, N are absent.

2. STEAL: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)
   - S and T are absent. E, A, L are present but not in their guessed positions.

From Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- Confirmed letters in the word: A, E, L (because A and E were already known from Guess 1, and now L is also confirmed present from Guess 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have three confirmed letters: A, E, L. There are two more letters we don't know yet.

Also, we have positional constraints:
- A is not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from STEAL, since STEAL has A at position 4 and feedback said A(-) meaning wrong position).
- E is not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from STEAL, since STEAL had E at position 3 and feedback E(-) meaning not at position 3).
- L is present but not at position 5 (from STEAL, L(-) at position 5).

The word has five positions. We know A, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions they haven't been tried.

Available positions: 1, 2, 4 (since A and E cannot be in 3 or 5, but note A can't be in 3 or 4, and E can't be in 3 or 5). Actually:
- A must be in 1, 2, or 5? But wait, in STEAL it was tried at 4 and was wrong, so A cannot be at 4. Also from CRANE we know A is not at 3. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5? But we also know that E is not at 5, and E is in the word, so position 5 is open for A? Yes, unless it's constrained otherwise.

Similarly, E cannot be at 3 or 5. So E must be at 1, 2, or 4.

L can be at any position except 5 (since tried and wrong in STEAL). So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

Now, we have two unknown letters to discover. We must choose a word that contains A, E, L and two new letters (since we haven't tried many). Also, avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We can focus on common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions carefully.

Let me list possible positions:

Position candidates:
- Position 1: could be A, E, L, or a new letter
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: cannot be A (tried in CRANE) or E (tried in STEAL) but L can be here? Or a new letter? Also note that position 3 is open for L or new letters.
- Position 4: cannot be A (tried in STEAL), but E can be here (it hasn't been tried at 4), L can be here, or new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (tried in CRANE), but A can be here? We haven't tried A at 5. L cannot be at position 5 (tried in STEAL). So position 5 can be A or a new letter.

So summary of constraints per position:
1: Any (A, E, L or new)
2: Any
3: Cannot be A or E (because A was tried at 3 in CRANE and was wrong, and E was tried at 3 in STEAL and was wrong). So position 3 must be L or a new letter.
4: Cannot be A (tried at 4 in STEAL and wrong) but can be E (not tried at 4) or L or new.
5: Cannot be E or L (E tried in CRANE and wrong, L tried in STEAL and wrong) so it can be A or a new letter.

So for the known letters:
A can be at: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out)
E can be at: 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are ruled out)
L can be at: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We know the word has exactly these three and two more unique letters.

We need to form a valid English word that includes A, E, L and two more letters (from the untested set) while respecting these positions.

We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let me brainstorm words that have A, E, L and two more consonants (since vowels are already included). Common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Consider if A is at 5: then words ending with A ... but many 5-letter words ending with A are not common? Also, E must be at 1,2,4 and L at 1,2,3,4.

Example: If A is at position 5, then the word ends with A.

Example words: 
- Maybe ""VIGIL"" but doesn't have A or E? Not having both.
- We need both A and E.

Alternative: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A.

For instance, A _ _ _ _

Then we need E and L somewhere.

Since position 3 cannot have A or E, it must be L or a new letter.

Similarly, position 5 must be A or new? But if A is at 1, then position 5 must be a new letter because we can't duplicate A (assuming unique letters as per feedback so far).

So if A is at 1, then positions:
1: A
2: ? (E, L, or new)
3: L or new (cannot be A or E)
4: ? (can be E, L, or new)
5: ? (must be new, since cannot be E or L, and A is already used)

So the word would be A followed by other letters.

Possible words: 
- AHEAD? But that has H, E, A, D. It has A at 1, E at 3? But position 3 cannot be E? Let's check: if A is at 1, then for ""AHEAD"": positions: A(1), H(2), E(3), A(4)? Wait, duplicate A? Also, A at 4 is not allowed? But in ""AHEAD"" it's A,H,E,A,D? Not valid? ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""AHEAD"" is A-H-E-A-D, so two A's? But that might be allowed? We don't know if duplicates are possible. The feedback so far didn't have any duplicate, but maybe the secret word can have duplicates? However, in CRANE and STEAL we had unique letters. Also, the rules don't say anything about duplicates. Let's recall: the secret word is a valid English word and could potentially have repeated letters? But I think we should assume it might until proven otherwise? However, in the absence of an indicator, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary.

But let me see: ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Yes, positions: 1:A, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A. That might complicate.

Moreover, position 3 is E, which we know cannot be position 3 (from STEAL feedback: E at position 3 was wrong). So E cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""AHEAD"" is impossible because it has E at 3.

Another word: ""ALIKE"" -> A(1), L(2), I(3), K(4), E(5). But E cannot be at position 5? (from CRANE). Also, position 3 is I, which is okay? But E at 5 is disallowed? So invalid.

How about ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed. Similarly.

So maybe A at 1 is tricky? I need A in a different position?

Next possibility: A at position 2?

Then the word: _ A _ _ _

Constraints:
Position 1: new letter or E or L? E or L can be at 1.
Position 2: A
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: can be E, L, new
Position 5: must be new (cannot be E or L, and A is already at 2)

So possible: _ A (L or new) (E/or L/or new) (new)

We also have to include E and L.

For example, if position 3 is L, then position 4 can be E? Then we have: _ A L E ? But position 5 must be new.

Words: ""BALED"" -> B, A, L, E, D. Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5).

Check constraints:
- Position 3: L -> allowed? Position 3 is allowed for L? Yes, since position 3 can be L or new. 
- Position 4: E -> allowed? Position 4 can be E? Yes, we haven't tried E at position 4? Correct.
- Position 5: D -> new letter and not prohibited? Yes.

Also, A at 2 is new? We haven't tried A at 2 before? Correct.

The word ""BALED"" is valid? Yes, meaning to have thrown out in a bundle? Or past tense of bale.

Also, letters: B, A, L, E, D. We introduce B and D, which haven't been tested.

Now, constraints for E: in ""BALED"", E is at position 4. We know E cannot be at 3 or 5, but 4 is okay? Yes. Similarly, A is at 2, which wasn't tried before. L is at 3, and we know it must not be at 5, but 3 is okay.

For A: we knew it couldn't be at 3 or 4, and here it's at 2? That's allowed.

Also, E is not at 3 or 5? At position 4, which is acceptable.

L is at 3? We didn't have constraint on L at 3? Only that it can't be at 5? So position 3 is acceptable? Yes.

So ""BALED"" seems promising.

Are there other possibilities? Another candidate: If we place A at position 5? Then the word ends with A.

It would be _ _ _ _ A

Constraints:
Position 1: new/E/L
Position 2: new/E/L
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: must be E, L, or new (cannot be A since A is at 5? Or duplicate? But we don't know if duplicated allowed). Let's assume unique letters to avoid complexity? Though feedback didn't indicate duplicates, so maybe the secret word has unique letters? In STEAL both A and E were present and we guessed them without duplicate issues? I think it's safe to assume unique letters until hinted otherwise? Therefore, A at 5 means other positions cannot have A.

Similarly, E must be at 1,2, or4? But position 4? Also L somewhere.

But position 4 cannot be E if E is elsewhere? Not necessarily.

But position 5 is A? Then position 4: can be E? Yes? Then we have ... E A at the end? Like some words?

Example: ""HYENA"" -> H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5). But E at position 3 is disallowed? And also N is eliminated? N is absent? So not valid.

Another: ""PANEL"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5). But N is absent? Also E at 4 is okay? But L at 5 is disallowed. And A at 2? Also, N is out? So no.

""OWE L A"" ... hard to find a word ending with A that has E and L without the eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""VODKA"" ... but no E? We need E.

So maybe focusing on A at 2 is better.

Back to ""BALED"" as a candidate.

Another word: if we place A at 1? It was problematic because position 3 and 5 constraints.

But what if L is at position 3? And E at 4? Then for position 1: must be new. Position 2: must be new? Because A at 1, so position 2: new, E or L? But E and L are at 4 and 3? So position 2 is new? Then the word: (new) (new) L E (new). And A at 1? That's A (new) L E (new). E is at position 4? That's okay? But position 5: new letter.

Word: A _ L E _

Need a letter for position 2 and 5? Common: ""APPLE"" but has P twice? And A at 1. But P and L,E? But no, ""APPLE"" has duplicate P? Also, ""ABLED"" -> A, B, L, E, D. But we already have ""BALED"" with similar.

""ABLED"": A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4? Valid? And L at 3? Valid? However, A at 1? Also, position 3 is L? Which is fine? Then position 5: D? Fine.

But we need to check the constraints? For A: we know from CRANE and STEAL feedback that A is not position 3 or 4? But position 1 hasn't been tried? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not tried at position 4? Okay? And L at 3? Okay? Position 5: D? Okay.

Then why choose between ""BALED"" and ""ABLED""?

""BALED"" has A at position 2 (we haven't ruled out position 2 for A? Actually, we only ruled out positions 3 and 4? So position 2 is open? Yes) and ""ABLED"" has A at position 1? Also open position.

Both seem possible? It gives information about A at position 1 or 2.

But let's think about which one introduces more common letters? Both introduce B and D? Same letters except order.

Also, consider frequency? Or perhaps I can pick one with more coverage?

Another possibility: place E at position 2? But I have limited guesses? Better to go with something.

Another word: ""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D. Positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But E at 3 is disallowed? And A at 4 is disallowed? So invalid.

""LEAVE"" but two E's? And A? And E at 5? Disallowed? Etc.

So back to ""BALED"" or ""ABLED"". Both use A, E, L and introduce B and D.

Which one? Maybe ""BALED"" because I want to know if A can be at 2? While with ""ABLED"" A is at 1? Both are untested positions.

Alternatively, I can think of a word that uses different new letters? For example, instead of B and D, use K and M? But B and D are common? So why not.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but T is absent? From STEAL, we know T is absent? So invalid? T is not in the word? Yes.

""MAPLE"" has M, A, P, L, E? Positions: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed? Invalid.

""GAZED"" has E at 5? Invalid.

So ""BALED"" and ""ABLED"" are both okay? Since we need to include E and L, with E not at 5? In both, E is at position 4? Which is okay? And L at position 3 in ABLED, or position 3 in BALED? BALED: positions are B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). ABLED: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So same letters, slightly different positions? But I must choose one.

Perhaps ""ABLED"" is not a word? No, ""abled"" is not common? Actually, ""ABLED"" is a valid word? It can be an adjective meaning having certain abilities? Or part of ""enabled""? But it's accepted in Wordle? I think.

To avoid controversy, I can choose ""BALED"". Also, it starts with B? Or ABLED starts with A? Since A is a vowel? But not that important.

A consideration: if I use ABLED, then A at 1 might be correct? But let's see what information we get?

With BALED: if the secret word does / does not have B or D? Or positions.

Similarly for ABLED.

I think BALED is fine.

Another possibility: ""FIELD"" but no E? And has E? F,I,E,L,D? But we don't have I? Also E at position 3? Disallowed? Pos: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5). E at 3 disallowed? And A is missing? So no.

""YIELD"" same, missing A.

So I think BALED is a good option.

But let me check if there are other words? Suppose we place E at position 1? Then word starts with E? Constraints: E cannot be at 3 or 5? But position 1 is okay? Then E _ _ _ _

Position 3: must be L or new? Cannot be A or E? Position 4: cannot be A? Position 5: cannot be E or L? So must be new? And A must be at ?, say position 2? A cannot be at 3 or 4? So position 2? Then: E A (L or new) (not A? So new or E or L? But E at 4?) Then E A ? ? ? 

With L: E A L ? ?

Then position 4: say E? Cannot, duplicate? L? Then E A L L? Duplicate? Or new? And position 5: new. Word: E A L (new) (new). Is there such a word? Like ""EAGLE""? E A G L E? But duplicate E? And E at position 5 disallowed? Also, L at 4? And G? But ends with E? Disallowed? Otherwise ""EAL"" something? Not easy.

""EARLY"" has R? Eliminated? R is absent? From CRANE so no.

So difficult? Therefore, ""BALED"" seems solid.

Thus, I'll go with ""BALED"" as my third guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-) → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5. C, R, N are absent.
- **STEAL**: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-) → E, A, L are in the word but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively. S and T are absent.

### Key deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A, E, L (since both guesses show their presence).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).
3. **Positional constraints**:
   - A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
   - E cannot be at position 3 (from STEAL) or position 5 (from CRANE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
   - L cannot be at position 5 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Unknowns**: Two additional letters are needed, which must not be C, R, N, S, T. Common untested letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.
5. **Word structure**: A valid 5-letter English word containing A, E, L and two new letters, respecting position constraints. No duplicates implied from feedback.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test repositioning of A, E, and L while introducing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D) to cover more ground.
- Choose a word that:
  - Puts A in an untested position (1, 2, or 5).
  - Puts E in an untested position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Puts L in an untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4, avoiding 5).
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, S, T).
- Candidate word: **BALED**
  - Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)
  - A at position 2: Allowed (not ruled out).
  - E at position 4: Allowed (not tested before).
  - L at position 3: Allowed (not ruled out, avoids position 5).
  - Introduces new letters: B and D (both untested).
  - Valid English word (meaning: past tense of bale).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints and covers potential vowels/consonants for the remaining unknown positions.",Guess 3: BALED -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) L(✓) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, I'm playing a word game where I need to guess a 5-letter word in six tries. First, I need to pick a good starting word. For word games like this, starting with a word that has common letters can help eliminate possibilities quickly.

Letters like A, E, R, S, T are used frequently in English, so including some of those might be effective. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended. Let me think of a word that fits.

""CLEAR"" comes to mind; it uses C, L, E, A, R. That covers several vowels and common consonants. Alternatively, ""STARE"" uses S, T, A, R, E—also pretty solid. 

Hmm, maybe ""CRANE"" would be even better because it includes C, R, A, N, E. Checking common letters: E is the most common vowel, R and N are frequent consonants. Yeah, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong choice.

Using a word with repeated letters might not be ideal for the first guess since duplicates could complicate feedback. ""CRANE"" has all unique letters. That's another plus.  

So I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let's tackle this wordle puzzle step by step. Here's the feedback after my first guess ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is present but misplaced (-), N is absent (x), and E is present but misplaced (-). 

First, I need to absorb what this tells me. The letters C, R, and N aren't in the secret word at all. So I can eliminate those completely from consideration. Meanwhile, A and E are definitely in the word, just not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"" – A wasn't position 3, and E wasn't position 5.

Now, since I know A and E must appear somewhere, but not in spots 3 and 5. The absent letters also give me clues – eliminating C, R, N narrows things significantly. The secret word has five letters total, so I have A and E confirmed, and three unknown letters that are neither C, R, N, nor duplicates of A/E.

For my next guess, I want to test new positions for A and E while introducing new common vowels or consonants to probe more letters. I should avoid using eliminated letters. So no C, R, or N. 

A good second guess often incorporates known letters in new positions. Since A was incorrectly placed in position 3, it might be elsewhere – maybe position 1,2,4? Similarly, E was wrong at position 5, so perhaps slot it elsewhere. But I can't fix both yet since I have limited spots. 

I recall common vowels like I and O haven't been tested yet. Maybe I should include them. Letters like S, T, L are also common and untested. So perhaps a word like ""SLATE"" – but wait, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. That introduces S, L, T while repositioning A and E. Checking positions: A was guessed in slot 3 last time, now in slot 3 again? Not ideal – I should move it. If I put A in position 1 or 2, and E in position 4 or something.

Alternative words: How about ""SAUTE""? It has S, A, U, T, E. Positions: A in slot 2 (new position), E in slot 5 (same as before? But last feedback said E was misplaced at 5, so E shouldn't be at 5... Right? Last time E was guessed at position 5 and was misplaced (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can't be last position. So ""SAUTE"" puts E at position 5 again – that's foolish! I must avoid position 5 for E entirely.

Good catch – E cannot be at the end. Similarly, A cannot be in position 3. So for ""SAUTE"", E at 5 is invalid. Bad choice. 

Better option: ""SLATE"" places A at 3 again, which was wrong last time. So why retest the same? Perhaps ""LATTE"", but it was confirmed that the secret word has unique letters? I'm not sure if duplicates are allowed? Assuming no duplicates unless feedback indicates otherwise. So preferably all unique letters.

Proper words: What about ""STEAL""? Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, L5. This puts A in position 4 (new), E in position 3 (new). Neither repeats a tested position – last guess had A at 3 and E at 5, both now shifted. And it introduces S, T, L – all common letters. Sounds strategic. 

Let me verify: ""STEAL"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to take unlawfully. Yes. Letter composition checks out: unique letters, avoids C/R/N. Tests A and E in fresh spots. Covers S, T, L – likely frequent letters. Plus, if S turns out correct, it reveals critical info.

So I'll go with ""STEAL"" as my next guess.<thinking>
The previous guess ""CRANE"" provided important clues:
- C, R, and N are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: C, R, N. They cannot appear in the word.
2. Confirmed letters: A and E must appear somewhere, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
3. New positions for A and E must be tested.
4. Three unknown letters remain (since A and E account for two spots).
5. The word has five distinct letters (no duplicates indicated by feedback).

Strategy for next guess:
- Reposition A: Not position 3 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, or 4.
- Reposition E: Not position 5 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Test new common consonants: S, T, L are high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoid eliminated letters C, R, N.

Good candidate word: ""STEAL""
- Positions: A is now at position 4 (a new position).
- Positions: E is now at position 3 (a new position).
- Introduces new letters: S, T, L.
- Uses confirmed letters A and E while respecting position constraints.
- Valid English word.

<guess>STEAL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - So the secret word contains A and E, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively. Also, C, R, N are absent.

2. STEAL: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)
   - S and T are absent. E, A, L are present but not in their guessed positions.

From Guess 1 and Guess 2:
- Confirmed letters in the word: A, E, L (because A and E were already known from Guess 1, and now L is also confirmed present from Guess 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We have three confirmed letters: A, E, L. There are two more letters we don't know yet.

Also, we have positional constraints:
- A is not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from STEAL, since STEAL has A at position 4 and feedback said A(-) meaning wrong position).
- E is not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from STEAL, since STEAL had E at position 3 and feedback E(-) meaning not at position 3).
- L is present but not at position 5 (from STEAL, L(-) at position 5).

The word has five positions. We know A, E, L are in the word but must be placed in positions they haven't been tried.

Available positions: 1, 2, 4 (since A and E cannot be in 3 or 5, but note A can't be in 3 or 4, and E can't be in 3 or 5). Actually:
- A must be in 1, 2, or 5? But wait, in STEAL it was tried at 4 and was wrong, so A cannot be at 4. Also from CRANE we know A is not at 3. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5? But we also know that E is not at 5, and E is in the word, so position 5 is open for A? Yes, unless it's constrained otherwise.

Similarly, E cannot be at 3 or 5. So E must be at 1, 2, or 4.

L can be at any position except 5 (since tried and wrong in STEAL). So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

Now, we have two unknown letters to discover. We must choose a word that contains A, E, L and two new letters (since we haven't tried many). Also, avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.

We can focus on common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions carefully.

Let me list possible positions:

Position candidates:
- Position 1: could be A, E, L, or a new letter
- Position 2: same
- Position 3: cannot be A (tried in CRANE) or E (tried in STEAL) but L can be here? Or a new letter? Also note that position 3 is open for L or new letters.
- Position 4: cannot be A (tried in STEAL), but E can be here (it hasn't been tried at 4), L can be here, or new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (tried in CRANE), but A can be here? We haven't tried A at 5. L cannot be at position 5 (tried in STEAL). So position 5 can be A or a new letter.

So summary of constraints per position:
1: Any (A, E, L or new)
2: Any
3: Cannot be A or E (because A was tried at 3 in CRANE and was wrong, and E was tried at 3 in STEAL and was wrong). So position 3 must be L or a new letter.
4: Cannot be A (tried at 4 in STEAL and wrong) but can be E (not tried at 4) or L or new.
5: Cannot be E or L (E tried in CRANE and wrong, L tried in STEAL and wrong) so it can be A or a new letter.

So for the known letters:
A can be at: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out)
E can be at: 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are ruled out)
L can be at: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is ruled out)

We know the word has exactly these three and two more unique letters.

We need to form a valid English word that includes A, E, L and two more letters (from the untested set) while respecting these positions.

We also want to cover common letters to maximize information.

Let me brainstorm words that have A, E, L and two more consonants (since vowels are already included). Common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

Consider if A is at 5: then words ending with A ... but many 5-letter words ending with A are not common? Also, E must be at 1,2,4 and L at 1,2,3,4.

Example: If A is at position 5, then the word ends with A.

Example words: 
- Maybe ""VIGIL"" but doesn't have A or E? Not having both.
- We need both A and E.

Alternative: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A.

For instance, A _ _ _ _

Then we need E and L somewhere.

Since position 3 cannot have A or E, it must be L or a new letter.

Similarly, position 5 must be A or new? But if A is at 1, then position 5 must be a new letter because we can't duplicate A (assuming unique letters as per feedback so far).

So if A is at 1, then positions:
1: A
2: ? (E, L, or new)
3: L or new (cannot be A or E)
4: ? (can be E, L, or new)
5: ? (must be new, since cannot be E or L, and A is already used)

So the word would be A followed by other letters.

Possible words: 
- AHEAD? But that has H, E, A, D. It has A at 1, E at 3? But position 3 cannot be E? Let's check: if A is at 1, then for ""AHEAD"": positions: A(1), H(2), E(3), A(4)? Wait, duplicate A? Also, A at 4 is not allowed? But in ""AHEAD"" it's A,H,E,A,D? Not valid? ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Actually, ""AHEAD"" is A-H-E-A-D, so two A's? But that might be allowed? We don't know if duplicates are possible. The feedback so far didn't have any duplicate, but maybe the secret word can have duplicates? However, in CRANE and STEAL we had unique letters. Also, the rules don't say anything about duplicates. Let's recall: the secret word is a valid English word and could potentially have repeated letters? But I think we should assume it might until proven otherwise? However, in the absence of an indicator, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary.

But let me see: ""AHEAD"" has two A's? Yes, positions: 1:A, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A. That might complicate.

Moreover, position 3 is E, which we know cannot be position 3 (from STEAL feedback: E at position 3 was wrong). So E cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""AHEAD"" is impossible because it has E at 3.

Another word: ""ALIKE"" -> A(1), L(2), I(3), K(4), E(5). But E cannot be at position 5? (from CRANE). Also, position 3 is I, which is okay? But E at 5 is disallowed? So invalid.

How about ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed. Similarly.

So maybe A at 1 is tricky? I need A in a different position?

Next possibility: A at position 2?

Then the word: _ A _ _ _

Constraints:
Position 1: new letter or E or L? E or L can be at 1.
Position 2: A
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: can be E, L, new
Position 5: must be new (cannot be E or L, and A is already at 2)

So possible: _ A (L or new) (E/or L/or new) (new)

We also have to include E and L.

For example, if position 3 is L, then position 4 can be E? Then we have: _ A L E ? But position 5 must be new.

Words: ""BALED"" -> B, A, L, E, D. Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5).

Check constraints:
- Position 3: L -> allowed? Position 3 is allowed for L? Yes, since position 3 can be L or new. 
- Position 4: E -> allowed? Position 4 can be E? Yes, we haven't tried E at position 4? Correct.
- Position 5: D -> new letter and not prohibited? Yes.

Also, A at 2 is new? We haven't tried A at 2 before? Correct.

The word ""BALED"" is valid? Yes, meaning to have thrown out in a bundle? Or past tense of bale.

Also, letters: B, A, L, E, D. We introduce B and D, which haven't been tested.

Now, constraints for E: in ""BALED"", E is at position 4. We know E cannot be at 3 or 5, but 4 is okay? Yes. Similarly, A is at 2, which wasn't tried before. L is at 3, and we know it must not be at 5, but 3 is okay.

For A: we knew it couldn't be at 3 or 4, and here it's at 2? That's allowed.

Also, E is not at 3 or 5? At position 4, which is acceptable.

L is at 3? We didn't have constraint on L at 3? Only that it can't be at 5? So position 3 is acceptable? Yes.

So ""BALED"" seems promising.

Are there other possibilities? Another candidate: If we place A at position 5? Then the word ends with A.

It would be _ _ _ _ A

Constraints:
Position 1: new/E/L
Position 2: new/E/L
Position 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)
Position 4: must be E, L, or new (cannot be A since A is at 5? Or duplicate? But we don't know if duplicated allowed). Let's assume unique letters to avoid complexity? Though feedback didn't indicate duplicates, so maybe the secret word has unique letters? In STEAL both A and E were present and we guessed them without duplicate issues? I think it's safe to assume unique letters until hinted otherwise? Therefore, A at 5 means other positions cannot have A.

Similarly, E must be at 1,2, or4? But position 4? Also L somewhere.

But position 4 cannot be E if E is elsewhere? Not necessarily.

But position 5 is A? Then position 4: can be E? Yes? Then we have ... E A at the end? Like some words?

Example: ""HYENA"" -> H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5). But E at position 3 is disallowed? And also N is eliminated? N is absent? So not valid.

Another: ""PANEL"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5). But N is absent? Also E at 4 is okay? But L at 5 is disallowed. And A at 2? Also, N is out? So no.

""OWE L A"" ... hard to find a word ending with A that has E and L without the eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""VODKA"" ... but no E? We need E.

So maybe focusing on A at 2 is better.

Back to ""BALED"" as a candidate.

Another word: if we place A at 1? It was problematic because position 3 and 5 constraints.

But what if L is at position 3? And E at 4? Then for position 1: must be new. Position 2: must be new? Because A at 1, so position 2: new, E or L? But E and L are at 4 and 3? So position 2 is new? Then the word: (new) (new) L E (new). And A at 1? That's A (new) L E (new). E is at position 4? That's okay? But position 5: new letter.

Word: A _ L E _

Need a letter for position 2 and 5? Common: ""APPLE"" but has P twice? And A at 1. But P and L,E? But no, ""APPLE"" has duplicate P? Also, ""ABLED"" -> A, B, L, E, D. But we already have ""BALED"" with similar.

""ABLED"": A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4? Valid? And L at 3? Valid? However, A at 1? Also, position 3 is L? Which is fine? Then position 5: D? Fine.

But we need to check the constraints? For A: we know from CRANE and STEAL feedback that A is not position 3 or 4? But position 1 hasn't been tried? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not tried at position 4? Okay? And L at 3? Okay? Position 5: D? Okay.

Then why choose between ""BALED"" and ""ABLED""?

""BALED"" has A at position 2 (we haven't ruled out position 2 for A? Actually, we only ruled out positions 3 and 4? So position 2 is open? Yes) and ""ABLED"" has A at position 1? Also open position.

Both seem possible? It gives information about A at position 1 or 2.

But let's think about which one introduces more common letters? Both introduce B and D? Same letters except order.

Also, consider frequency? Or perhaps I can pick one with more coverage?

Another possibility: place E at position 2? But I have limited guesses? Better to go with something.

Another word: ""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D. Positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But E at 3 is disallowed? And A at 4 is disallowed? So invalid.

""LEAVE"" but two E's? And A? And E at 5? Disallowed? Etc.

So back to ""BALED"" or ""ABLED"". Both use A, E, L and introduce B and D.

Which one? Maybe ""BALED"" because I want to know if A can be at 2? While with ""ABLED"" A is at 1? Both are untested positions.

Alternatively, I can think of a word that uses different new letters? For example, instead of B and D, use K and M? But B and D are common? So why not.

Another word: ""TABLE"" but T is absent? From STEAL, we know T is absent? So invalid? T is not in the word? Yes.

""MAPLE"" has M, A, P, L, E? Positions: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed? Invalid.

""GAZED"" has E at 5? Invalid.

So ""BALED"" and ""ABLED"" are both okay? Since we need to include E and L, with E not at 5? In both, E is at position 4? Which is okay? And L at position 3 in ABLED, or position 3 in BALED? BALED: positions are B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). ABLED: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So same letters, slightly different positions? But I must choose one.

Perhaps ""ABLED"" is not a word? No, ""abled"" is not common? Actually, ""ABLED"" is a valid word? It can be an adjective meaning having certain abilities? Or part of ""enabled""? But it's accepted in Wordle? I think.

To avoid controversy, I can choose ""BALED"". Also, it starts with B? Or ABLED starts with A? Since A is a vowel? But not that important.

A consideration: if I use ABLED, then A at 1 might be correct? But let's see what information we get?

With BALED: if the secret word does / does not have B or D? Or positions.

Similarly for ABLED.

I think BALED is fine.

Another possibility: ""FIELD"" but no E? And has E? F,I,E,L,D? But we don't have I? Also E at position 3? Disallowed? Pos: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5). E at 3 disallowed? And A is missing? So no.

""YIELD"" same, missing A.

So I think BALED is a good option.

But let me check if there are other words? Suppose we place E at position 1? Then word starts with E? Constraints: E cannot be at 3 or 5? But position 1 is okay? Then E _ _ _ _

Position 3: must be L or new? Cannot be A or E? Position 4: cannot be A? Position 5: cannot be E or L? So must be new? And A must be at ?, say position 2? A cannot be at 3 or 4? So position 2? Then: E A (L or new) (not A? So new or E or L? But E at 4?) Then E A ? ? ? 

With L: E A L ? ?

Then position 4: say E? Cannot, duplicate? L? Then E A L L? Duplicate? Or new? And position 5: new. Word: E A L (new) (new). Is there such a word? Like ""EAGLE""? E A G L E? But duplicate E? And E at position 5 disallowed? Also, L at 4? And G? But ends with E? Disallowed? Otherwise ""EAL"" something? Not easy.

""EARLY"" has R? Eliminated? R is absent? From CRANE so no.

So difficult? Therefore, ""BALED"" seems solid.

Thus, I'll go with ""BALED"" as my third guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-) → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5. C, R, N are absent.
- **STEAL**: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-) → E, A, L are in the word but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively. S and T are absent.

### Key deductions:
1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A, E, L (since both guesses show their presence).
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).
3. **Positional constraints**:
   - A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.
   - E cannot be at position 3 (from STEAL) or position 5 (from CRANE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
   - L cannot be at position 5 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. **Unknowns**: Two additional letters are needed, which must not be C, R, N, S, T. Common untested letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.
5. **Word structure**: A valid 5-letter English word containing A, E, L and two new letters, respecting position constraints. No duplicates implied from feedback.

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test repositioning of A, E, and L while introducing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D) to cover more ground.
- Choose a word that:
  - Puts A in an untested position (1, 2, or 5).
  - Puts E in an untested position (1, 2, or 4).
  - Puts L in an untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4, avoiding 5).
  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, S, T).
- Candidate word: **BALED**
  - Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)
  - A at position 2: Allowed (not ruled out).
  - E at position 4: Allowed (not tested before).
  - L at position 3: Allowed (not ruled out, avoids position 5).
  - Introduces new letters: B and D (both untested).
  - Valid English word (meaning: past tense of bale).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints and covers potential vowels/consonants for the remaining unknown positions.

First, I need to pick a good starting word. For word games like this, starting with a word that has common letters can help eliminate possibilities quickly.\n\nLetters like A, E, R, S, T are used frequently in English, so including some of those might be effective. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended. Let me think of a word that fits.\n\n""CLEAR"" comes to mind; it uses C, L, E, A, R. That covers several vowels and common consonants. Alternatively, ""STARE"" uses S, T, A, R, E—also pretty solid. \n\nHmm, maybe ""CRANE"" would be even better because it includes C, R, A, N, E. Checking common letters: E is the most common vowel, R and N are frequent consonants. Yeah, ""CRANE"" seems like a strong choice.\n\nUsing a word with repeated letters might not be ideal for the first guess since duplicates could complicate feedback. ""CRANE"" has all unique letters. That\'s another plus.  \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, let\'s tackle this wordle puzzle step by step. Here\'s the feedback after my first guess ""CRANE"": C is absent (x), R is absent (x), A is present but misplaced (-), N is absent (x), and E is present but misplaced (-). \n\nFirst, I need to absorb what this tells me. The letters C, R, and N aren\'t in the secret word at all. So I can eliminate those completely from consideration. Meanwhile, A and E are definitely in the word, just not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"" – A wasn\'t position 3, and E wasn\'t position 5.\n\nNow, since I know A and E must appear somewhere, but not in spots 3 and 5. The absent letters also give me clues – eliminating C, R, N narrows things significantly. The secret word has five letters total, so I have A and E confirmed, and three unknown letters that are neither C, R, N, nor duplicates of A/E.\n\nFor my next guess, I want to test new positions for A and E while introducing new common vowels or consonants to probe more letters. I should avoid using eliminated letters. So no C, R, or N. \n\nA good second guess often incorporates known letters in new positions. Since A was incorrectly placed in position 3, it might be elsewhere – maybe position 1,2,4? Similarly, E was wrong at position 5, so perhaps slot it elsewhere. But I can\'t fix both yet since I have limited spots. \n\nI recall common vowels like I and O haven\'t been tested yet. Maybe I should include them. Letters like S, T, L are also common and untested. So perhaps a word like ""SLATE"" – but wait, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. That introduces S, L, T while repositioning A and E. Checking positions: A was guessed in slot 3 last time, now in slot 3 again? Not ideal – I should move it. If I put A in position 1 or 2, and E in position 4 or something.\n\nAlternative words: How about ""SAUTE""? It has S, A, U, T, E. Positions: A in slot 2 (new position), E in slot 5 (same as before? But last feedback said E was misplaced at 5, so E shouldn\'t be at 5... Right? Last time E was guessed at position 5 and was misplaced (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can\'t be last position. So ""SAUTE"" puts E at position 5 again – that\'s foolish! I must avoid position 5 for E entirely.\n\nGood catch – E cannot be at the end. Similarly, A cannot be in position 3. So for ""SAUTE"", E at 5 is invalid. Bad choice. \n\nBetter option: ""SLATE"" places A at 3 again, which was wrong last time. So why retest the same? Perhaps ""LATTE"", but it was confirmed that the secret word has unique letters? I\'m not sure if duplicates are allowed? Assuming no duplicates unless feedback indicates otherwise. So preferably all unique letters.\n\nProper words: What about ""STEAL""? Positions: S1, T2, E3, A4, L5. This puts A in position 4 (new), E in position 3 (new). Neither repeats a tested position – last guess had A at 3 and E at 5, both now shifted. And it introduces S, T, L – all common letters. Sounds strategic. \n\nLet me verify: ""STEAL"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to take unlawfully. Yes. Letter composition checks out: unique letters, avoids C/R/N. Tests A and E in fresh spots. Covers S, T, L – likely frequent letters. Plus, if S turns out correct, it reveals critical info.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAL"" as my next guess.<thinking>\nThe previous guess ""CRANE"" provided important clues:\n- C, R, and N are NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).\n- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n1. Eliminated letters: C, R, N. They cannot appear in the word.\n2. Confirmed letters: A and E must appear somewhere, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.\n3. New positions for A and E must be tested.\n4. Three unknown letters remain (since A and E account for two spots).\n5. The word has five distinct letters (no duplicates indicated by feedback).\n\nStrategy for next guess:\n- Reposition A: Not position 3 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, or 4.\n- Reposition E: Not position 5 (previously wrong). Try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Test new common consonants: S, T, L are high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.\n- Avoid eliminated letters C, R, N.\n\nGood candidate word: ""STEAL""\n- Positions: A is now at position 4 (a new position).\n- Positions: E is now at position 3 (a new position).\n- Introduces new letters: S, T, L.\n- Uses confirmed letters A and E while respecting position constraints.\n- Valid English word.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>STEAL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

There are two more letters we don\'t know yet.\n\nAlso, we have positional constraints:\n- A is not at position 3 (from CRANE) and not at position 4 (from STEAL, since STEAL has A at position 4 and feedback said A(-) meaning wrong position).\n- E is not at position 5 (from CRANE) and not at position 3 (from STEAL, since STEAL had E at position 3 and feedback E(-) meaning not at position 3).\n- L is present but not at position 5 (from STEAL, L(-) at position 5).\n\nThe word has five positions.

Actually:\n- A must be in 1, 2, or 5? But wait, in STEAL it was tried at 4 and was wrong, so A cannot be at 4. Also from CRANE we know A is not at 3. So A can be at positions 1, 2, or 5? But we also know that E is not at 5, and E is in the word, so position 5 is open for A? Yes, unless it\'s constrained otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at 3 or 5. So E must be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nL can be at any position except 5 (since tried and wrong in STEAL). So L can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, we have two unknown letters to discover. We must choose a word that contains A, E, L and two new letters (since we haven\'t tried many). Also, avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T.\n\nWe can focus on common letters that haven\'t been tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also need to consider the positions carefully.\n\nLet me list possible positions:\n\nPosition candidates:\n- Position 1: could be A, E, L, or a new letter\n- Position 2: same\n- Position 3: cannot be A (tried in CRANE) or E (tried in STEAL) but L can be here? Or a new letter? Also note that position 3 is open for L or new letters.\n- Position 4: cannot be A (tried in STEAL), but E can be here (it hasn\'t been tried at 4), L can be here, or new letter.\n- Position 5: cannot be E (tried in CRANE), but A can be here? We haven\'t tried A at 5. L cannot be at position 5 (tried in STEAL). So position 5 can be A or a new letter.\n\nSo summary of constraints per position:\n1: Any (A, E, L or new)\n2: Any\n3: Cannot be A or E (because A was tried at 3 in CRANE and was wrong, and E was tried at 3 in STEAL and was wrong). So position 3 must be L or a new letter.\n4: Cannot be A (tried at 4 in STEAL and wrong) but can be E (not tried at 4) or L or new.\n5: Cannot be E or L (E tried in CRANE and wrong, L tried in STEAL and wrong) so it can be A or a new letter.\n\nSo for the known letters:\nA can be at: 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out)\nE can be at: 1, 2, 4 (since 3 and 5 are ruled out)\nL can be at: 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 5 is ruled out)\n\nWe know the word has exactly these three and two more unique letters.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word that includes A, E, L and two more letters (from the untested set) while respecting these positions.\n\nWe also want to cover common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet me brainstorm words that have A, E, L and two more consonants (since vowels are already included). Common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.\n\nConsider if A is at 5: then words ending with A ... but many 5-letter words ending with A are not common? Also, E must be at 1,2,4 and L at 1,2,3,4.\n\nExample: If A is at position 5, then the word ends with A.\n\nExample words: \n- Maybe ""VIGIL"" but doesn\'t have A or E? Not having both.\n- We need both A and E.\n\nAlternative: A at position 1? Then the word starts with A.\n\nFor instance, A _ _ _ _\n\nThen we need E and L somewhere.\n\nSince position 3 cannot have A or E, it must be L or a new letter.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 must be A or new? But if A is at 1, then position 5 must be a new letter because we can\'t duplicate A (assuming unique letters as per feedback so far).\n\nSo if A is at 1, then positions:\n1: A\n2: ? (E, L, or new)\n3: L or new (cannot be A or E)\n4: ? (can be E, L, or new)\n5: ? (must be new, since cannot be E or L, and A is already used)\n\nSo the word would be A followed by other letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- AHEAD? But that has H, E, A, D. It has A at 1, E at 3? But position 3 cannot be E? Let\'s check: if A is at 1, then for ""AHEAD"": positions: A(1), H(2), E(3), A(4)? Wait, duplicate A? Also, A at 4 is not allowed? But in ""AHEAD"" it\'s A,H,E,A,D? Not valid? ""AHEAD"" has two A\'s? Actually, ""AHEAD"" is A-H-E-A-D, so two A\'s? But that might be allowed? We don\'t know if duplicates are possible. The feedback so far didn\'t have any duplicate, but maybe the secret word can have duplicates? However, in CRANE and STEAL we had unique letters. Also, the rules don\'t say anything about duplicates. Let\'s recall: the secret word is a valid English word and could potentially have repeated letters? But I think we should assume it might until proven otherwise? However, in the absence of an indicator, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut let me see: ""AHEAD"" has two A\'s? Yes, positions: 1:A, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A, 5:D. So duplicate A. That might complicate.\n\nMoreover, position 3 is E, which we know cannot be position 3 (from STEAL feedback: E at position 3 was wrong). So E cannot be at 3. Therefore, ""AHEAD"" is impossible because it has E at 3.\n\nAnother word: ""ALIKE"" -> A(1), L(2), I(3), K(4), E(5). But E cannot be at position 5? (from CRANE). Also, position 3 is I, which is okay? But E at 5 is disallowed? So invalid.\n\nHow about ""ALIVE"": A(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed. Similarly.\n\nSo maybe A at 1 is tricky? I need A in a different position?\n\nNext possibility: A at position 2?\n\nThen the word: _ A _ _ _\n\nConstraints:\nPosition 1: new letter or E or L? E or L can be at 1.\nPosition 2: A\nPosition 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)\nPosition 4: can be E, L, new\nPosition 5: must be new (cannot be E or L, and A is already at 2)\n\nSo possible: _ A (L or new) (E/or L/or new) (new)\n\nWe also have to include E and L.\n\nFor example, if position 3 is L, then position 4 can be E? Then we have: _ A L E ? But position 5 must be new.\n\nWords: ""BALED"" -> B, A, L, E, D. Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Position 3: L -> allowed? Position 3 is allowed for L? Yes, since position 3 can be L or new. \n- Position 4: E -> allowed? Position 4 can be E? Yes, we haven\'t tried E at position 4? Correct.\n- Position 5: D -> new letter and not prohibited? Yes.\n\nAlso, A at 2 is new? We haven\'t tried A at 2 before? Correct.\n\nThe word ""BALED"" is valid? Yes, meaning to have thrown out in a bundle? Or past tense of bale.\n\nAlso, letters: B, A, L, E, D. We introduce B and D, which haven\'t been tested.\n\nNow, constraints for E: in ""BALED"", E is at position 4. We know E cannot be at 3 or 5, but 4 is okay? Yes. Similarly, A is at 2, which wasn\'t tried before. L is at 3, and we know it must not be at 5, but 3 is okay.\n\nFor A: we knew it couldn\'t be at 3 or 4, and here it\'s at 2? That\'s allowed.\n\nAlso, E is not at 3 or 5? At position 4, which is acceptable.\n\nL is at 3? We didn\'t have constraint on L at 3? Only that it can\'t be at 5? So position 3 is acceptable? Yes.\n\nSo ""BALED"" seems promising.\n\nAre there other possibilities? Another candidate: If we place A at position 5? Then the word ends with A.\n\nIt would be _ _ _ _ A\n\nConstraints:\nPosition 1: new/E/L\nPosition 2: new/E/L\nPosition 3: must be L or new (cannot be A or E)\nPosition 4: must be E, L, or new (cannot be A since A is at 5? Or duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicated allowed). Let\'s assume unique letters to avoid complexity? Though feedback didn\'t indicate duplicates, so maybe the secret word has unique letters? In STEAL both A and E were present and we guessed them without duplicate issues? I think it\'s safe to assume unique letters until hinted otherwise? Therefore, A at 5 means other positions cannot have A.\n\nSimilarly, E must be at 1,2, or4? But position 4? Also L somewhere.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be E if E is elsewhere? Not necessarily.\n\nBut position 5 is A? Then position 4: can be E? Yes? Then we have ... E A at the end? Like some words?\n\nExample: ""HYENA"" -> H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5). But E at position 3 is disallowed? And also N is eliminated? N is absent? So not valid.\n\nAnother: ""PANEL"" -> P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5). But N is absent? Also E at 4 is okay? But L at 5 is disallowed. And A at 2? Also, N is out? So no.\n\n""OWE L A"" ... hard to find a word ending with A that has E and L without the eliminated letters.\n\nPerhaps ""VODKA"" ... but no E? We need E.\n\nSo maybe focusing on A at 2 is better.\n\nBack to ""BALED"" as a candidate.\n\nAnother word: if we place A at 1? It was problematic because position 3 and 5 constraints.\n\nBut what if L is at position 3? And E at 4? Then for position 1: must be new. Position 2: must be new? Because A at 1, so position 2: new, E or L? But E and L are at 4 and 3? So position 2 is new? Then the word: (new) (new) L E (new). And A at 1? That\'s A (new) L E (new). E is at position 4? That\'s okay? But position 5: new letter.\n\nWord: A _ L E _\n\nNeed a letter for position 2 and 5? Common: ""APPLE"" but has P twice? And A at 1. But P and L,E? But no, ""APPLE"" has duplicate P? Also, ""ABLED"" -> A, B, L, E, D. But we already have ""BALED"" with similar.\n\n""ABLED"": A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). E at 4? Valid? And L at 3? Valid? However, A at 1? Also, position 3 is L? Which is fine? Then position 5: D? Fine.\n\nBut we need to check the constraints? For A: we know from CRANE and STEAL feedback that A is not position 3 or 4? But position 1 hasn\'t been tried? So okay? Similarly, E at 4? Not tried at position 4? Okay? And L at 3? Okay? Position 5: D? Okay.\n\nThen why choose between ""BALED"" and ""ABLED""?\n\n""BALED"" has A at position 2 (we haven\'t ruled out position 2 for A? Actually, we only ruled out positions 3 and 4? So position 2 is open? Yes) and ""ABLED"" has A at position 1? Also open position.\n\nBoth seem possible? It gives information about A at position 1 or 2.\n\nBut let\'s think about which one introduces more common letters? Both introduce B and D? Same letters except order.\n\nAlso, consider frequency? Or perhaps I can pick one with more coverage?\n\nAnother possibility: place E at position 2? But I have limited guesses? Better to go with something.\n\nAnother word: ""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D. Positions: P(1), L(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But E at 3 is disallowed? And A at 4 is disallowed? So invalid.\n\n""LEAVE"" but two E\'s? And A? And E at 5? Disallowed? Etc.\n\nSo back to ""BALED"" or ""ABLED"". Both use A, E, L and introduce B and D.\n\nWhich one? Maybe ""BALED"" because I want to know if A can be at 2? While with ""ABLED"" A is at 1? Both are untested positions.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of a word that uses different new letters? For example, instead of B and D, use K and M? But B and D are common? So why not.\n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"" but T is absent? From STEAL, we know T is absent? So invalid? T is not in the word? Yes.\n\n""MAPLE"" has M, A, P, L, E? Positions: M(1), A(2), P(3), L(4), E(5). But E at 5 is disallowed? Invalid.\n\n""GAZED"" has E at 5? Invalid.\n\nSo ""BALED"" and ""ABLED"" are both okay? Since we need to include E and L, with E not at 5? In both, E is at position 4? Which is okay? And L at position 3 in ABLED, or position 3 in BALED? BALED: positions are B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). ABLED: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). So same letters, slightly different positions? But I must choose one.\n\nPerhaps ""ABLED"" is not a word? No, ""abled"" is not common? Actually, ""ABLED"" is a valid word? It can be an adjective meaning having certain abilities? Or part of ""enabled""? But it\'s accepted in Wordle? I think.\n\nTo avoid controversy, I can choose ""BALED"". Also, it starts with B? Or ABLED starts with A? Since A is a vowel? But not that important.\n\nA consideration: if I use ABLED, then A at 1 might be correct? But let\'s see what information we get?\n\nWith BALED: if the secret word does / does not have B or D? Or positions.\n\nSimilarly for ABLED.\n\nI think BALED is fine.\n\nAnother possibility: ""FIELD"" but no E? And has E? F,I,E,L,D? But we don\'t have I? Also E at position 3? Disallowed? Pos: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5). E at 3 disallowed? And A is missing? So no.\n\n""YIELD"" same, missing A.\n\nSo I think BALED is a good option.\n\nBut let me check if there are other words? Suppose we place E at position 1? Then word starts with E? Constraints: E cannot be at 3 or 5? But position 1 is okay? Then E _ _ _ _\n\nPosition 3: must be L or new? Cannot be A or E? Position 4: cannot be A? Position 5: cannot be E or L? So must be new? And A must be at ?, say position 2? A cannot be at 3 or 4? So position 2? Then: E A (L or new) (not A? So new or E or L? But E at 4?) Then E A ? ? ? \n\nWith L: E A L ? ?\n\nThen position 4: say E? Cannot, duplicate? L? Then E A L L? Duplicate? Or new? And position 5: new. Word: E A L (new) (new). Is there such a word? Like ""EAGLE""? E A G L E? But duplicate E? And E at position 5 disallowed? Also, L at 4? And G? But ends with E? Disallowed? Otherwise ""EAL"" something? Not easy.\n\n""EARLY"" has R? Eliminated? R is absent? From CRANE so no.\n\nSo difficult? Therefore, ""BALED"" seems solid.\n\nThus, I\'ll go with ""BALED"" as my third guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **CRANE**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-) → A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 and 5. C, R, N are absent.\n- **STEAL**: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-) → E, A, L are in the word but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively. S and T are absent.\n\n### Key deductions:\n1. **Confirmed letters in the secret word**: A, E, L (since both guesses show their presence).\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).\n3. **Positional constraints**:\n   - A cannot be at position 3 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 5.\n   - E cannot be at position 3 (from STEAL) or position 5 (from CRANE). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n   - L cannot be at position 5 (from STEAL). Possible positions: 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n4. **Unknowns**: Two additional letters are needed, which must not be C, R, N, S, T. Common untested letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.\n5. **Word structure**: A valid 5-letter English word containing A, E, L and two new letters, respecting position constraints. No duplicates implied from feedback.\n\n### Strategy for this guess:\n- Test repositioning of A, E, and L while introducing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., B, D) to cover more ground.\n- Choose a word that:\n  - Puts A in an untested position (1, 2, or 5).\n  - Puts E in an untested position (1, 2, or 4).\n  - Puts L in an untested position (1, 2, 3, or 4, avoiding 5).\n  - Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, S, T).\n- Candidate word: **BALED**\n  - Positions: B(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)\n  - A at position 2: Allowed (not ruled out).\n  - E at position 4: Allowed (not tested before).\n  - L at position 3: Allowed (not ruled out, avoids position 5).\n  - Introduces new letters: B and D (both untested).\n  - Valid English word (meaning: past tense of bale).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the constraints and covers potential vowels/consonants for the remaining unknown positions.\n\n<guess>BALED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(-)\nGuess 3: BALED -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) L(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
   - A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively.
   - C, R, N are absent.

2. STEAL: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)
   - E, A, L are in the word, but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
   - S and T are absent.

3. BALED: B(-), A(-), L(✓), E(✓), D(✓)
   - L is correct at position 3 (✓).
   - E is correct at position 4 (✓).
   - D is correct at position 5 (✓).
   - B is in the word but not at position 1 (-).
   - A is in the word but not at position 2 (-).

From BALED feedback:
- Positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed: L, E, D respectively. So the word ends with ""LED"".
- A is present but not at position 2, and B is present but not at position 1.

Since positions 3,4,5 are fixed, the word is: _ _ L E D

We know A and B are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2? Actually, A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) and B cannot be at position 1 (from BALED). But they must be placed in the remaining positions: position 1 and 2? But there are only two positions left: 1 and 2.

The word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 → 3=L, 4=E, 5=D.

So positions 1 and 2 must be filled with A and B? But we have two positions and two letters: A and B, but also we know from previous that A is present and B is present? But are there only two letters left? The word must contain A and B, and they must go in positions 1 and 2.

But we have constraints:
- A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) and also cannot be at position 3 or 4 (from previous, but position 3 and 4 are taken by L and E, so A must be at position 1? Because position 5 is D, so only position 1 is left for A? But we have two positions: 1 and 2.

Let's list the knowns:
- The word: [1] [2] L E D
- Confirmed letters: A, B, L, E, D → so the word must contain A and B? But L, E, D are fixed, so positions 1 and 2 must be A and B? But we have two positions and two letters? So the word is either A B L E D or B A L E D? But we have feedback that rules out some positions.

From BALED:
- B is present but not at position 1 → so B cannot be at position 1? But in the word, position 1 is open? So if B is not at 1, then B must be at position 2? Because the only other position is 2? And A must be at position 1? But A cannot be at position 2? So:

If A is at position 1, and B at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? That's fine. And B cannot be at position 1? So if we put A at 1 and B at 2, then B is at 2? But the feedback says B is not at position 1? That doesn't say anything about position 2? So it's okay? Similarly, A is not at position 2? So if A is at 1, that's fine.

But what about the word ""ABLED""? A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). But we have feedback from BALED that A is not at position 2? In ABLED, A is at 1, not 2? So that's consistent? And B is at 2? But in BALED, B was at position 1 and was wrong? So B is not at 1? But in ABLED, B is at 2? So that's okay? And we have L, E, D at 3,4,5? Correct.

But is ""ABLED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning capable or having abilities.

But let's check the feedback from BALED: for the word BALED, we had B at 1 (wrong position), A at 2 (wrong position), L at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), D at 5 (correct). So the secret word has B and A, but not at positions 1 and 2? But in ABLED, A is at 1 and B is at 2? So that would mean that in the secret word, A is at 1 and B is at 2? But the feedback says for BALED: A is not at 2? That's about the guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not at position 2? So if the secret word has A at 1, that's fine? Similarly, B is not at position 1? So if secret word has B at 2, that's fine? So ABLED should be the word?

But we have another constraint: from STEAL, we know that A is not at position 4? But in ABLED, A is at 1? So no issue? Similarly, E is not at position 3? But in ABLED, E is at 4? Correct.

But let's confirm the entire feedback for ABLED? We haven't guessed it yet? But based on what we know, it seems to fit.

But is there another possibility? The word must have A and B? But what if there are duplicate letters? For example, could there be another letter? But we have five positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 3,4,5 are fixed as L,E,D. So positions 1 and 2 must be A and B? But the feedback from BALED says that B is present and A is present? So yes, the two missing letters are A and B? So the word is either ABLED or BALED? But BALED was already guessed and we know that in BALED, B was at 1 (wrong) and A at 2 (wrong)? So the secret word cannot be BALED? Because if it were, then B would be at 1? But feedback says B is not at 1? So secret word is not BALED? Therefore, it must be ABLED? With A at 1 and B at 2.

But let's double-check the feedback for BALED: when we guessed BALED, we got B(-) meaning B is in the word but not at position 1? And A(-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? And L(✓), E(✓), D(✓). So the secret word has B, A, L, E, D? With L at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And A not at 2, B not at 1? So for positions 1 and 2: we must place A and B? But A cannot be at 2? So A must be at 1? And B cannot be at 1? So B must be at 2? Therefore, the secret word must be ABLED.

But is that the only possibility? What if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, could there be another A or B? But positions 3,4,5 are fixed? So if there is a duplicate, it would have to be in position 1 or 2? But we have to place two distinct letters? A and B? So no duplicate? Therefore, the word is ABLED.

But let's make sure about the previous constraints? From CRANE: A is not at position 3? In ABLED, A is at 1? Fine. E is not at 5? In ABLED, E is at 4? Fine. From STEAL: A is not at 4? Fine. E not at 3? Fine. L not at 5? In ABLED, L is at 3? Fine. Also, S and T absent? ABLED has no S or T? Fine.

So the secret word should be ABLED.

But we are to make a new guess? We have three guesses left? But if we are sure, we can guess ABLED? But let's see if there is any other possibility? What if the word has a different letter? But we know from BALED that B and A are present? And positions 3,4,5 are fixed? So no.

Perhaps the word has only one of A or B? But feedback says both are present? BALED feedback: B(-) and A(-) both indicate presence? Yes, the minus means the letter is in the word but wrong position? So both A and B are in the word? And with positions 3,4,5 fixed, they must be at 1 and 2? And with the constraints, A at 1 and B at 2? So ABLED.

Therefore, I will guess ABLED.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is any word that ends with LED and has A and B? For example, ""BLADE"" but that has A at position 3? But position 3 is L? Fixed? So not. Or ""BLEED"" but has two E's? And no A? But we need A? Also, E at 5? Disallowed? Etc. So no.

Thus, the only possibility is ABLED.

### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

1. **Feedback Recap**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
     → A and E are in the word, but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, N are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (STEAL)**: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)  
     → E, A, L are in the word, but not at positions 3, 4, or 5. S and T are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (BALED)**: B(-), A(-), L(✓), E(✓), D(✓)  
     → L, E, D are **correct** at positions 3, 4, and 5. B and A are in the word but not at positions 1 or 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed: **L** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **D** (position 5).  
     → The word ends with **LED**.
   - The full word structure is: `[Position 1] [Position 2] L E D`.
   - **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, B, L, E, D (from BALED feedback: A and B are present, and L, E, D are fixed).
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).
   - **Positional constraints**:
     - A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) or positions 3/4 (from CRANE and STEAL).  
       → A must be at position 1 (the only remaining valid position).
     - B cannot be at position 1 (from BALED).  
       → B must be at position 2 (the only remaining position).
   - **Resulting word**: **A B L E D** (ABLED).

3. **Validation**:
   - ABLED is a valid English word (adjective meaning ""having abilities"").
   - It satisfies all feedback:
     - A is at position 1 (not 2, 3, or 4).
     - B is at position 2 (not 1).
     - L, E, D are at positions 3, 4, 5 (correct).
     - No absent letters (C, R, N, S, T) are used.

Given the deductions, the secret word must be **ABLED**. This guess uses the remaining letters (A and B) in their only possible positions.

<guess>ABLED</guess>",ABLED,"We have feedback from three guesses:

2. STEAL: S(x), T(x), E(-), A(-), L(-)
   - E, A, L are in the word, but not at positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
   - S and T are absent.

3. BALED: B(-), A(-), L(✓), E(✓), D(✓)
   - L is correct at position 3 (✓).
   - E is correct at position 4 (✓).
   - D is correct at position 5 (✓).
   - B is in the word but not at position 1 (-).
   - A is in the word but not at position 2 (-).

From BALED feedback:
- Positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed: L, E, D respectively. So the word ends with ""LED"".
- A is present but not at position 2, and B is present but not at position 1.

Since positions 3,4,5 are fixed, the word is: _ _ L E D

We know A and B are in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2? Actually, A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) and B cannot be at position 1 (from BALED). But they must be placed in the remaining positions: position 1 and 2? But there are only two positions left: 1 and 2.

The word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 → 3=L, 4=E, 5=D.

So positions 1 and 2 must be filled with A and B? But we have two positions and two letters: A and B, but also we know from previous that A is present and B is present? But are there only two letters left? The word must contain A and B, and they must go in positions 1 and 2.

But we have constraints:
- A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) and also cannot be at position 3 or 4 (from previous, but position 3 and 4 are taken by L and E, so A must be at position 1? Because position 5 is D, so only position 1 is left for A? But we have two positions: 1 and 2.

- The word: [1] [2] L E D
- Confirmed letters: A, B, L, E, D → so the word must contain A and B? But L, E, D are fixed, so positions 1 and 2 must be A and B? But we have two positions and two letters? So the word is either A B L E D or B A L E D? But we have feedback that rules out some positions.

From BALED:
- B is present but not at position 1 → so B cannot be at position 1? But in the word, position 1 is open? So if B is not at 1, then B must be at position 2? Because the only other position is 2? And A must be at position 1? But A cannot be at position 2? So:

If A is at position 1, and B at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? That's fine. And B cannot be at position 1? So if we put A at 1 and B at 2, then B is at 2? But the feedback says B is not at position 1? That doesn't say anything about position 2? So it's okay? Similarly, A is not at position 2? So if A is at 1, that's fine.

But what about the word ""ABLED""? A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), D(5). But we have feedback from BALED that A is not at position 2? In ABLED, A is at 1, not 2? So that's consistent? And B is at 2? But in BALED, B was at position 1 and was wrong? So B is not at 1? But in ABLED, B is at 2? So that's okay? And we have L, E, D at 3,4,5? Correct.

But is ""ABLED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning capable or having abilities.

But let's check the feedback from BALED: for the word BALED, we had B at 1 (wrong position), A at 2 (wrong position), L at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), D at 5 (correct).

But the feedback says for BALED: A is not at 2? That's about the guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not at position 2? So if the secret word has A at 1, that's fine? Similarly, B is not at position 1? So if secret word has B at 2, that's fine? So ABLED should be the word?

But we have another constraint: from STEAL, we know that A is not at position 4? But in ABLED, A is at 1? So no issue? Similarly, E is not at position 3? But in ABLED, E is at 4? Correct.

Because if it were, then B would be at 1? But feedback says B is not at 1? So secret word is not BALED? Therefore, it must be ABLED? With A at 1 and B at 2.

But let's double-check the feedback for BALED: when we guessed BALED, we got B(-) meaning B is in the word but not at position 1? And A(-) meaning A is in the word but not at position 2? And L(✓), E(✓), D(✓). So the secret word has B, A, L, E, D? With L at 3, E at 4, D at 5? And A not at 2, B not at 1? So for positions 1 and 2: we must place A and B? But A cannot be at 2? So A must be at 1? And B cannot be at 1? So B must be at 2? Therefore, the secret word must be ABLED.

But is that the only possibility? What if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, could there be another A or B? But positions 3,4,5 are fixed? So if there is a duplicate, it would have to be in position 1 or 2? But we have to place two distinct letters? A and B? So no duplicate? Therefore, the word is ABLED.

But let's make sure about the previous constraints? From CRANE: A is not at position 3? In ABLED, A is at 1? Fine. E is not at 5? In ABLED, E is at 4? Fine. From STEAL: A is not at 4? Fine. E not at 3? Fine. L not at 5? In ABLED, L is at 3? Fine. Also, S and T absent? ABLED has no S or T? Fine.

So the secret word should be ABLED.

But we are to make a new guess? We have three guesses left? But if we are sure, we can guess ABLED? But let's see if there is any other possibility? What if the word has a different letter? But we know from BALED that B and A are present? And positions 3,4,5 are fixed? So no.

Thus, the only possibility is ABLED.### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

     → L, E, D are **correct** at positions 3, 4, and 5. B and A are in the word but not at positions 1 or 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed: **L** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **D** (position 5).  
     → The word ends with **LED**.
   - The full word structure is: `[Position 1] [Position 2] L E D`.
   - **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, B, L, E, D (from BALED feedback: A and B are present, and L, E, D are fixed).
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, N (from CRANE), S, T (from STEAL).
   - **Positional constraints**:
     - A cannot be at position 2 (from BALED) or positions 3/4 (from CRANE and STEAL).  
       → A must be at position 1 (the only remaining valid position).
     - B cannot be at position 1 (from BALED).  
       → B must be at position 2 (the only remaining position).
   - **Resulting word**: **A B L E D** (ABLED).

3. **Validation**:
   - ABLED is a valid English word (adjective meaning ""having abilities"").
   - It satisfies all feedback:
     - A is at position 1 (not 2, 3, or 4).
     - B is at position 2 (not 1).
     - L, E, D are at positions 3, 4, 5 (correct).
     - No absent letters (C, R, N, S, T) are used.

Given the deductions, the secret word must be **ABLED**. This guess uses the remaining letters (A and B) in their only possible positions.",Guess 4: ABLED -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) L(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
