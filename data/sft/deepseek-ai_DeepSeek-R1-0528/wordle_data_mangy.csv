We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C -> x (not in the word)
 R -> x (not in the word)
 A -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 N -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 E -> x (not in the word)

 So, we know that:
 - The letters C, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

 Since C, R, E are absent, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

 We have two letters that are present: A and N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try a word that includes A and N, but in different positions, and avoid C, R, E.

 Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not in the positions we tried before (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

 Additionally, we can try other vowels and common consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: I, O, U (but we already have A, and E is absent so we don't use E)

 Let me consider possible words:

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5.

 We should try a word that puts A and N in different positions than before.

 Also, we might try to include other common letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Since we only have two letters known to be present, we want to maximize new letters.

 Let me think of words that have A and N and three new letters (not C, R, E).

 Example words: 
 - ""PLANT"": This has P, L, A, N, T. But note we placed A at position 3? Wait, in ""PLANT"": 
      P (position1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
   However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be wrong again? 
   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it's not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.

 In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.

 What about ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T.
   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don't want N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.

 Let me avoid R.

 Another idea: ""SAINT""? 
   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new). 
   But N is at position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

 So we need a word where A and N are in positions that we haven't tried for them. For A, we tried position 3; for N, we tried position 4.

 Let me try to put A at position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5, and N at position 1,2,3,5.

 How about ""MANGO""? 
   M (new), A (at position 2), N (at position 3), G (new), O (new).
   This avoids the positions we know: A was tried at 3 and was wrong, now we try at 2. N was tried at 4 and wrong, now we try at 3.

 But note: we are not sure about the positions. This guess might help.

 Also, we must check that we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have them.

 Another word: ""PAINT"" was bad because of N at 4. What about ""PATIO""? 
   P, A, T, I, O.
   This doesn't include N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to verify and to get more feedback.

 Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.

 Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.

 Another word: ""STAND"": 
   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.

 How about ""SANDY"": 
   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? 
   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). 
   Also, avoids C, R, E.

 However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn't at 4.

 We don't know if N can be at 3 or not.

 So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.

 But we want to cover more common letters. Let's see:

 ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.
 ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.

 Both are valid words.

 Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? 
   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it's not there.

 Another word: ""NASTY"": 
   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). 
   Here, N at 1 (we didn't try that) and A at 2 (didn't try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.

 Also, doesn't have C, R, E.

 Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:
   - It includes A and N.
   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn't try) and A at position 2 (new).
   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.

 So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. 
   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.

 So avoid ""TAINT"".

 Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

 Let me confirm: 
   N at position 1: we don't know if that's correct or not.
   A at position 2: we don't know.
   S at position 3: new.
   T at position 4: new.
   Y at position 5: new.

 We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.

 And it doesn't contain C, R, E.

 So guess: ""NASTY"".

 We'll see the feedback and adjust.

Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)
- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)

For the new guess:
1. Avoid C, R, E completely
2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)
4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:
   - Places N at position 1 (new position)
   - Places A at position 2 (new position)
   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters
   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)

   P, A, I, N, T.
   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don't want N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.

   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it's not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.

 In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.

 What about ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T.
   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don't want N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.

 Let me avoid R.

   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new).

 How about ""MANGO""?

 Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.

 Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.

 Another word: ""STAND"": 
   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.

 How about ""SANDY"": 
   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? 
   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). 
   Also, avoids C, R, E.

 However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn't at 4.

 We don't know if N can be at 3 or not.

 So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.

 But we want to cover more common letters. Let's see:

 ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.
 ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.

 Both are valid words.

 Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? 
   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it's not there.

 Another word: ""NASTY"": 
   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). 
   Here, N at 1 (we didn't try that) and A at 2 (didn't try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.

 Also, doesn't have C, R, E.

 Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:
   - It includes A and N.
   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn't try) and A at position 2 (new).
   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.

 So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. 
   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.

 So avoid ""TAINT"".

 Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

 Let me confirm: 
   N at position 1: we don't know if that's correct or not.
   A at position 2: we don't know.
   S at position 3: new.
   T at position 4: new.
   Y at position 5: new.

 We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.

 And it doesn't contain C, R, E.

 So guess: ""NASTY"".

 We'll see the feedback and adjust.

<guess>nasty</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)
- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)

For the new guess:
1. Avoid C, R, E completely
2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)
4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:
   - Places N at position 1 (new position)
   - Places A at position 2 (new position)
   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters
   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it's marked as - for position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.

Also, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.

Letters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

But note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don't know about positions 3 and 4 for N.

Also, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don't know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.

Now, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y

And we know N is in the word, but we don't know its position.

From ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, N must be at position 3.

Because:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""
- Position 2: occupied by A
- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can't be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That's right.

Wait, let me clarify:

The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).
- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).

N is present:
- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.
- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.

Therefore, N must be at position 3. Because that's the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).

So the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven't confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.

But note: we haven't tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.

So we are confident that:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.

Actually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don't know.

Wait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven't encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let's not rule it out.

However, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N's. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N's, we wouldn't necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.

But if the secret word has two N's, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven't guessed a word with two N's, we don't know.

But for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.

If the word has two N's, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? 

Alternatively, the feedback system doesn't say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N's and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N's might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N's? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. 

Similarly, for the secret word, if it has two N's, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there's at least one occurrence? But we don't get information about the count.

Therefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there's no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.

Therefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.

So the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.

We must also use only letters that haven't been eliminated and that we know are possible:

Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.

But note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).

And we must avoid those absent letters.

What about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.

But also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.

But we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

And the word must be valid English.

Moreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don't know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.

Therefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.

But note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don't know?

For example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.

So we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

Possible words? Let me think:

Common words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.

But wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.

- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N's? But we are only considering.

""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.

So ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven't confirmed it? But we don't want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?

But actually, we haven't verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But how about testing for the fourth letter? 

We know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.

We know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.

Let me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.

For example:
- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.
- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.
- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.
- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.

Also, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.

""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? 
""MANKY"": not common? 
""PANFY"": no?

""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.

Therefore, valid common words: 
- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)
- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That's allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.

But note: we don't know if D is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). 

We want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.

But note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N's? 

However, let's think: if the word has two N's? Then one N could be at a position we haven't guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? 

For instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). 

Wait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That's not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? 

We need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? 

For example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? 

Common words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn't have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? 

We know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don't know? 

Therefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? 

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5 letters? 

Therefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? 

Thus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.

We must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Possible words: 

- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.
- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.
- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That's fine.
- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N's? 
- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? 
- ""LANZY""? Not English?
- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? 
- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?
- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? 

We want to try to guess correctly? But we don't know which one? 

The best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? 

We have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? 

New letters could help eliminate? 

So for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? 
""MANLY"" uses M, L? 
etc. 

But if we guess and it's incorrect, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? 

But let's think: we have to pick one? 

I think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? 

So I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? 

""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""HANDY"", and it's the word? We win? 

If not, we'll get feedback and continue? 

But note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?

But another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

But since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? 

Actually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.

We need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? 

Likely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? 

But common letters? 

For example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? 

Actually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? 

Similarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? 

So the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth? And an N in third? 

So like: * A N * Y? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY"" (adj) 
- ""BANDY"" (verb) 
- ""DANDY"" (noun) 
- ""FANNY"" (noun) 
- ""HANDY"" (adj) 
- ""CANDY"" (noun) -> but C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"" (adj) -> R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"" (adj) -> S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"" (adj) -> T eliminated? 
- ""WANLY"" (adv) -> word: W A N L Y? 
- ""DANCY"" -> not common? 

So eliminated: C, R, E, S, T? So the words left? 
- ""BANDY"", ""DANDY"", ""FANNY"", ""HANDY"", ""MANLY"", ""WANLY"", etc? 

We can also have ""PANSY""? P A N S Y? But S eliminated? 

So no? 

Then the candidates: 
Band of brothers: ""BANDY"" 
Dandy: ""DANDY"" 
Fanny: ""FANNY"" 
Handy: ""HANDY"" 
Manly: ""MANLY"" 
Wanly: ""WANLY"" 

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, M, W? 

We haven't tested L? but in ""manly"" we have L? 

We want to make a guess that can help if it's not correct? 

But actually, we can choose one: ""HANDY"" seems very popular? 

But let me think: we also want to avoid worst-case? 

But time is short? 

I think we should try ""HANDY""? 

Alternatively, we could choose ""BANDY"" or another? 

But note: if we choose a word that has as many letters as possible not used? 

For example, if we guess ""BANDY"", we test B and D? 

If we guess ""MANLY"", we test M and L? 

But ""MANLY"" has L? Which is common? 

We might get more information? 

But since we might win immediately? 

The goal is to minimize the number of guesses? But we don't know which one? 

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses only one of the unknowns? But that doesn't exist? 

So I decide to go with ""HANDY"". 

If it's not, we'll see? 

Therefore, guess: ""HANDY""

</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✗) R(✗) A(➖) N(➖) E(✗)**  
  This indicates:
  - C, R, E are **absent** in the secret word.
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: nasty → N(➖) A(✓) S(✗) T(✗) Y(✓)**  
  This indicates:
  - N is **present** but not in position 1.
  - A is **present** and in the **correct position (position 2)**.
  - S and T are **absent**.
  - Y is **present** and in the **correct position (position 5)**.

### Key deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? Y** (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
2. **N is present** but:
   - Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback).
   - Not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).
   - Not at position 2 (A) or 5 (Y), so it **must be at position 3**.
3. Thus, the pattern is now: **? A N ? Y**.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Present letters**: A (fixed position 2), N (position 3), Y (fixed position 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4.
- Possible candidates include **HANDY**, **MANLY**, **BANDY**, **DANDY**, **FANNY**, or **WANLY**.
- **HANDY** is a common English word that fits the pattern and tests common consonants (H, D) not yet used.
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm/reject H and D, narrowing future guesses.

<guess>handy</guess>",handy,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it's marked as - for position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.

Also, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.

Letters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

But note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don't know about positions 3 and 4 for N.

Also, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don't know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.

Now, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y

And we know N is in the word, but we don't know its position.

From ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, N must be at position 3.

Because:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""
- Position 2: occupied by A
- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can't be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That's right.

Wait, let me clarify:

The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).
- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).

N is present:
- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.
- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.

Therefore, N must be at position 3. Because that's the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).

So the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven't confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.

But note: we haven't tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.

So we are confident that:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.

Actually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don't know.

Wait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven't encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let's not rule it out.

However, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N's. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N's, we wouldn't necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.

But if the secret word has two N's, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven't guessed a word with two N's, we don't know.

But for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.

If the word has two N's, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? 

Alternatively, the feedback system doesn't say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N's and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N's might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N's? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. 

Similarly, for the secret word, if it has two N's, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there's at least one occurrence? But we don't get information about the count.

Therefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there's no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.

Therefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.

So the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.

We must also use only letters that haven't been eliminated and that we know are possible:

Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.

But note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).

And we must avoid those absent letters.

What about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.

But also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.

But we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

And the word must be valid English.

Moreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don't know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.

Therefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.

But note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don't know?

For example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.

So we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

Possible words? Let me think:

Common words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.

But wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.

- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N's? But we are only considering.

""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.

So ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven't confirmed it? But we don't want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?

But actually, we haven't verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But how about testing for the fourth letter? 

We know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.

We know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.

Let me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.

For example:
- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.
- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.
- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.
- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.

Also, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.

""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? 
""MANKY"": not common? 
""PANFY"": no?

""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.

Therefore, valid common words: 
- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)
- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That's allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.

But note: we don't know if D is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). 

We want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.

But note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N's? 

However, let's think: if the word has two N's? Then one N could be at a position we haven't guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? 

For instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). 

Wait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That's not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? 

We need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? 

For example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? 

Common words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn't have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? 

We know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don't know? 

Therefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? 

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5 letters? 

Therefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? 

Thus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.

We must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Possible words: 

- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.
- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.
- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That's fine.
- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N's? 
- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? 
- ""LANZY""? Not English?
- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? 
- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?
- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? 

We want to try to guess correctly? But we don't know which one? 

The best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? 

We have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? 

New letters could help eliminate? 

So for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? 
""MANLY"" uses M, L? 
etc. 

But if we guess and it's incorrect, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? 

But let's think: we have to pick one? 

I think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? 

So I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? 

""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""HANDY"", and it's the word? We win? 

If not, we'll get feedback and continue? 

But note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?

But another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

But since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? 

Actually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.

We need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? 

Likely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? 

But common letters? 

For example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? 

Actually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? 

Similarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? 

So the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth? And an N in third? 

So like: * A N * Y? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY"" (adj) 
- ""BANDY"" (verb) 
- ""DANDY"" (noun) 
- ""FANNY"" (noun) 
- ""HANDY"" (adj) 
- ""CANDY"" (noun) -> but C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"" (adj) -> R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"" (adj) -> S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"" (adj) -> T eliminated? 
- ""WANLY"" (adv) -> word: W A N L Y? 
- ""DANCY"" -> not common? 

So eliminated: C, R, E, S, T? So the words left? 
- ""BANDY"", ""DANDY"", ""FANNY"", ""HANDY"", ""MANLY"", ""WANLY"", etc? 

We can also have ""PANSY""? P A N S Y? But S eliminated? 

So no? 

Then the candidates: 
Band of brothers: ""BANDY"" 
Dandy: ""DANDY"" 
Fanny: ""FANNY"" 
Handy: ""HANDY"" 
Manly: ""MANLY"" 
Wanly: ""WANLY"" 

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, M, W? 

We haven't tested L? but in ""manly"" we have L? 

We want to make a guess that can help if it's not correct?

<guess>handy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✗) R(✗) A(➖) N(➖) E(✗)**  
  This indicates:
  - C, R, E are **absent** in the secret word.
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: nasty → N(➖) A(✓) S(✗) T(✗) Y(✓)**  
  This indicates:
  - N is **present** but not in position 1.
  - A is **present** and in the **correct position (position 2)**.
  - S and T are **absent**.
  - Y is **present** and in the **correct position (position 5)**.

### Key deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? Y** (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
2. **N is present** but:
   - Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback).
   - Not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).

4. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Present letters**: A (fixed position 2), N (position 3), Y (fixed position 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4.
- Possible candidates include **HANDY**, **MANLY**, **BANDY**, **DANDY**, **FANNY**, or **WANLY**.
- **HANDY** is a common English word that fits the pattern and tests common consonants (H, D) not yet used.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,mangy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a common and effective starting word. It contains the common vowels 'A' and 'E' and the consonants 'C', 'R', 'N' which are also common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C -> x (not in the word)
 R -> x (not in the word)
 A -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 N -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 E -> x (not in the word)

 So, we know that:
 - The letters C, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

 Since C, R, E are absent, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

 We have two letters that are present: A and N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try a word that includes A and N, but in different positions, and avoid C, R, E.

 Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not in the positions we tried before (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

 Additionally, we can try other vowels and common consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: I, O, U (but we already have A, and E is absent so we don't use E)

 Let me consider possible words:

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5.

 We should try a word that puts A and N in different positions than before.

 Also, we might try to include other common letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Since we only have two letters known to be present, we want to maximize new letters.

 Let me think of words that have A and N and three new letters (not C, R, E).

 Example words: 
 - ""PLANT"": This has P, L, A, N, T. But note we placed A at position 3? Wait, in ""PLANT"": 
      P (position1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
   However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be wrong again? 
   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it's not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.

 In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.

 What about ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T.
   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don't want N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.

 Let me avoid R.

 Another idea: ""SAINT""? 
   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new). 
   But N is at position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

 So we need a word where A and N are in positions that we haven't tried for them. For A, we tried position 3; for N, we tried position 4.

 Let me try to put A at position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5, and N at position 1,2,3,5.

 How about ""MANGO""? 
   M (new), A (at position 2), N (at position 3), G (new), O (new).
   This avoids the positions we know: A was tried at 3 and was wrong, now we try at 2. N was tried at 4 and wrong, now we try at 3.

 But note: we are not sure about the positions. This guess might help.

 Also, we must check that we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have them.

 Another word: ""PAINT"" was bad because of N at 4. What about ""PATIO""? 
   P, A, T, I, O.
   This doesn't include N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to verify and to get more feedback.

 Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.

 Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.

 Another word: ""STAND"": 
   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.

 How about ""SANDY"": 
   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? 
   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). 
   Also, avoids C, R, E.

 However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn't at 4.

 We don't know if N can be at 3 or not.

 So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.

 But we want to cover more common letters. Let's see:

 ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.
 ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.

 Both are valid words.

 Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? 
   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it's not there.

 Another word: ""NASTY"": 
   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). 
   Here, N at 1 (we didn't try that) and A at 2 (didn't try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.

 Also, doesn't have C, R, E.

 Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:
   - It includes A and N.
   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn't try) and A at position 2 (new).
   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.

 So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. 
   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.

 So avoid ""TAINT"".

 Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

 Let me confirm: 
   N at position 1: we don't know if that's correct or not.
   A at position 2: we don't know.
   S at position 3: new.
   T at position 4: new.
   Y at position 5: new.

 We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.

 And it doesn't contain C, R, E.

 So guess: ""NASTY"".

 We'll see the feedback and adjust.

<guess>nasty</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)
- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)

For the new guess:
1. Avoid C, R, E completely
2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)
4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:
   - Places N at position 1 (new position)
   - Places A at position 2 (new position)
   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters
   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it's marked as - for position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.

Also, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.

Letters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

But note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don't know about positions 3 and 4 for N.

Also, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don't know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.

Now, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y

And we know N is in the word, but we don't know its position.

From ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, N must be at position 3.

Because:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""
- Position 2: occupied by A
- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can't be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That's right.

Wait, let me clarify:

The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).
- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).

N is present:
- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.
- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.

Therefore, N must be at position 3. Because that's the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).

So the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven't confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.

But note: we haven't tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.

So we are confident that:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.

Actually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don't know.

Wait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven't encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let's not rule it out.

However, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N's. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N's, we wouldn't necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.

But if the secret word has two N's, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven't guessed a word with two N's, we don't know.

But for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.

If the word has two N's, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? 

Alternatively, the feedback system doesn't say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N's and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N's might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N's? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. 

Similarly, for the secret word, if it has two N's, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there's at least one occurrence? But we don't get information about the count.

Therefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there's no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.

Therefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.

So the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.

We must also use only letters that haven't been eliminated and that we know are possible:

Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.

But note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).

And we must avoid those absent letters.

What about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.

But also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.

But we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

And the word must be valid English.

Moreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don't know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.

Therefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.

But note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don't know?

For example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.

So we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

Possible words? Let me think:

Common words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.

But wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.

- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N's? But we are only considering.

""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.

So ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven't confirmed it? But we don't want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?

But actually, we haven't verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But how about testing for the fourth letter? 

We know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.

We know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.

Let me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.

For example:
- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.
- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.
- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.
- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.

Also, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.

""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? 
""MANKY"": not common? 
""PANFY"": no?

""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.

Therefore, valid common words: 
- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)
- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That's allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.

But note: we don't know if D is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). 

We want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.

But note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N's? 

However, let's think: if the word has two N's? Then one N could be at a position we haven't guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? 

For instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). 

Wait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That's not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? 

We need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? 

For example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? 

Common words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn't have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? 

We know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don't know? 

Therefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? 

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5 letters? 

Therefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? 

Thus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.

We must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Possible words: 

- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.
- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.
- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That's fine.
- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N's? 
- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? 
- ""LANZY""? Not English?
- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? 
- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?
- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? 

We want to try to guess correctly? But we don't know which one? 

The best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? 

We have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? 

New letters could help eliminate? 

So for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? 
""MANLY"" uses M, L? 
etc. 

But if we guess and it's incorrect, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? 

But let's think: we have to pick one? 

I think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? 

So I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? 

""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""HANDY"", and it's the word? We win? 

If not, we'll get feedback and continue? 

But note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?

But another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

But since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? 

Actually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.

We need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? 

Likely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? 

But common letters? 

For example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? 

Actually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? 

Similarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? 

So the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth? And an N in third? 

So like: * A N * Y? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY"" (adj) 
- ""BANDY"" (verb) 
- ""DANDY"" (noun) 
- ""FANNY"" (noun) 
- ""HANDY"" (adj) 
- ""CANDY"" (noun) -> but C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"" (adj) -> R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"" (adj) -> S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"" (adj) -> T eliminated? 
- ""WANLY"" (adv) -> word: W A N L Y? 
- ""DANCY"" -> not common? 

So eliminated: C, R, E, S, T? So the words left? 
- ""BANDY"", ""DANDY"", ""FANNY"", ""HANDY"", ""MANLY"", ""WANLY"", etc? 

We can also have ""PANSY""? P A N S Y? But S eliminated? 

So no? 

Then the candidates: 
Band of brothers: ""BANDY"" 
Dandy: ""DANDY"" 
Fanny: ""FANNY"" 
Handy: ""HANDY"" 
Manly: ""MANLY"" 
Wanly: ""WANLY"" 

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, M, W? 

We haven't tested L? but in ""manly"" we have L? 

We want to make a guess that can help if it's not correct? 

But actually, we can choose one: ""HANDY"" seems very popular? 

But let me think: we also want to avoid worst-case? 

But time is short? 

I think we should try ""HANDY""? 

Alternatively, we could choose ""BANDY"" or another? 

But note: if we choose a word that has as many letters as possible not used? 

For example, if we guess ""BANDY"", we test B and D? 

If we guess ""MANLY"", we test M and L? 

But ""MANLY"" has L? Which is common? 

We might get more information? 

But since we might win immediately? 

The goal is to minimize the number of guesses? But we don't know which one? 

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses only one of the unknowns? But that doesn't exist? 

So I decide to go with ""HANDY"". 

If it's not, we'll see? 

Therefore, guess: ""HANDY""

<guess>handy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✗) R(✗) A(➖) N(➖) E(✗)**  
  This indicates:
  - C, R, E are **absent** in the secret word.
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: nasty → N(➖) A(✓) S(✗) T(✗) Y(✓)**  
  This indicates:
  - N is **present** but not in position 1.
  - A is **present** and in the **correct position (position 2)**.
  - S and T are **absent**.
  - Y is **present** and in the **correct position (position 5)**.

### Key deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? Y** (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
2. **N is present** but:
   - Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback).
   - Not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).
   - Not at position 2 (A) or 5 (Y), so it **must be at position 3**.
3. Thus, the pattern is now: **? A N ? Y**.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Present letters**: A (fixed position 2), N (position 3), Y (fixed position 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4.
- Possible candidates include **HANDY**, **MANLY**, **BANDY**, **DANDY**, **FANNY**, or **WANLY**.
- **HANDY** is a common English word that fits the pattern and tests common consonants (H, D) not yet used.
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm/reject H and D, narrowing future guesses.

We should try a word that includes A and N, but in different positions, and avoid C, R, E.\n\n Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\n Let me think of a word that:\n - Does not contain C, R, E.\n - Contains A and N, but not in the positions we tried before (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n\n Additionally, we can try other vowels and common consonants.\n\n Common vowels remaining: I, O, U (but we already have A, and E is absent so we don\'t use E)\n\n Let me consider possible words:\n\n We know A is in the word but not at position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n We should try a word that puts A and N in different positions than before.\n\n Also, we might try to include other common letters like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Since we only have two letters known to be present, we want to maximize new letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and N and three new letters (not C, R, E).\n\n Example words: \n - ""PLANT"": This has P, L, A, N, T. But note we placed A at position 3? Wait, in ""PLANT"": \n      P (position1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). \n   However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be wrong again? \n   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it\'s not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.\n\n In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.\n\n What about ""PAINT""? \n   P, A, I, N, T.\n   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don\'t want N at position 4 again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.\n\n How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.\n\n Let me avoid R.\n\n Another idea: ""SAINT""? \n   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new). \n   But N is at position 4 again, which we know is wrong.\n\n So we need a word where A and N are in positions that we haven\'t tried for them. For A, we tried position 3; for N, we tried position 4.\n\n Let me try to put A at position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5, and N at position 1,2,3,5.\n\n How about ""MANGO""? \n   M (new), A (at position 2), N (at position 3), G (new), O (new).\n   This avoids the positions we know: A was tried at 3 and was wrong, now we try at 2. N was tried at 4 and wrong, now we try at 3.\n\n But note: we are not sure about the positions. This guess might help.\n\n Also, we must check that we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Another word: ""PAINT"" was bad because of N at 4. What about ""PATIO""? \n   P, A, T, I, O.\n   This doesn\'t include N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to verify and to get more feedback.\n\n Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.\n\n Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.\n\n Another word: ""STAND"": \n   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.\n\n How about ""SANDY"": \n   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? \n   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). \n   Also, avoids C, R, E.\n\n However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn\'t at 4.\n\n We don\'t know if N can be at 3 or not.\n\n So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.\n\n But we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s see:\n\n ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.\n ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.\n\n Both are valid words.\n\n Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? \n   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Another word: ""NASTY"": \n   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). \n   Here, N at 1 (we didn\'t try that) and A at 2 (didn\'t try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.\n\n Also, doesn\'t have C, R, E.\n\n Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:\n   - It includes A and N.\n   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn\'t try) and A at position 2 (new).\n   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.\n\n So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. \n   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.\n\n So avoid ""TAINT"".\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".\n\n Let me confirm: \n   N at position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s correct or not.\n   A at position 2: we don\'t know.\n   S at position 3: new.\n   T at position 4: new.\n   Y at position 5: new.\n\n We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.\n\n And it doesn\'t contain C, R, E.\n\n So guess: ""NASTY"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and adjust.\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)\n- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)\n\nFor the new guess:\n1. Avoid C, R, E completely\n2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)\n3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)\n4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:\n   - Places N at position 1 (new position)\n   - Places A at position 2 (new position)\n   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters\n   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, E are not in the word at all.\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).\n- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).\n\nSecond guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it\'s marked as - for position 1).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- S is not in the word at all (x).\n- T is not in the word at all (x).\n- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.\n\nAlso, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nLetters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).\n\nBut note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don\'t know about positions 3 and 4 for N.\n\nAlso, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don\'t know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.\n\nNow, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n\nAnd we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know its position.\n\nFrom ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 3.\n\nBecause:\n- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""\n- Position 2: occupied by A\n- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can\'t be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That\'s right.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).\n- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).\n\nN is present:\n- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.\n- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 3. Because that\'s the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).\n\nSo the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven\'t confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.\n\nSo we are confident that:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.\n\nActually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven\'t seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don\'t know.\n\nWait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven\'t encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let\'s not rule it out.\n\nHowever, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N\'s. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N\'s, we wouldn\'t necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.\n\nBut if the secret word has two N\'s, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven\'t guessed a word with two N\'s, we don\'t know.\n\nBut for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.\n\nIf the word has two N\'s, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? \n\nAlternatively, the feedback system doesn\'t say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N\'s and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N\'s might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N\'s? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. \n\nSimilarly, for the secret word, if it has two N\'s, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there\'s at least one occurrence? But we don\'t get information about the count.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there\'s no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.\n\nSo the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.\n\nWe must also use only letters that haven\'t been eliminated and that we know are possible:\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nMoreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.\n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nBut note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).\n\nAnd we must avoid those absent letters.\n\nWhat about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.\n\nBut also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.\n\nAnd the word must be valid English.\n\nMoreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don\'t know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.\n\nTherefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.\n\nBut note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don\'t know?\n\nFor example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.\n\nSo we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.\n\nPossible words? Let me think:\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.\n\nBut wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.\n\n- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N\'s? But we are only considering.\n\n""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.\n\nSo ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven\'t confirmed it? But we don\'t want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?\n\nBut actually, we haven\'t verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it\'s the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.\n\nBut how about testing for the fourth letter? \n\nWe know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.\n\nWe know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.\n\nLet me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.\n- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.\n- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.\n- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.\n\nAlso, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.\n\n""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? \n""MANKY"": not common? \n""PANFY"": no?\n\n""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.\n\nTherefore, valid common words: \n- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)\n- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That\'s allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if D is in the word? \n\nAlternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). \n\nWe want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.\n\nBut note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N\'s? \n\nHowever, let\'s think: if the word has two N\'s? Then one N could be at a position we haven\'t guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? \n\nFor instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). \n\nWait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That\'s not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? \n\nWe need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? \n\nFor example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? \n\nCommon words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn\'t have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? \n\nWe know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don\'t know? \n\nTherefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? \n\nUnless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it\'s 5 letters? \n\nTherefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? \n\nThus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.\n\nWe must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.\n\nPossible words: \n\n- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.\n- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.\n- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That\'s fine.\n- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N\'s? \n- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? \n- ""LANZY""? Not English?\n- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? \n- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?\n- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? \n\nWe want to try to guess correctly? But we don\'t know which one? \n\nThe best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? \n\nWe have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? \n\nNew letters could help eliminate? \n\nSo for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? \n""MANLY"" uses M, L? \netc. \n\nBut if we guess and it\'s incorrect, we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? \n\nBut let\'s think: we have to pick one? \n\nI think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? \n\nSo I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? \n\n""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf we guess ""HANDY"", and it\'s the word? We win? \n\nIf not, we\'ll get feedback and continue? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?\n\nBut another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? \n\nBut since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? \n\nActually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.\n\nWe need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? \n\nLikely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? \n\nBut common letters? \n\nFor example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? \n\nActually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? \n\nSimilarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? \n\nSo the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: nasty -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- N is present but not in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- S and T are absent.
- Y is correct in position 5.

Guess 3: handy -> Feedback: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- H is absent (x).
- A is correct in position 2 (✓ already knew).
- N is correct in position 3 (✓).
- D is absent (x).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).

So now we know:
- The secret word pattern: ? A N ? Y  (positions: 2=A, 3=N, 5=Y)
- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: A, N, Y.
- We need to find the letter for position 1 and position 4.
- But note: from guess 3, D is absent, and H is absent.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

Also, we have used:
- A, N, Y are confirmed and in correct positions.

Now, the word pattern is: [1] A N [4] Y

We know that the first letter position and the fourth letter position must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

We have guessed ""handy"" and now know that D and H are absent.

But note: ""handy"" has A at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), and Y at 5 (correct). The first letter H was absent, and the fourth letter D was absent.

Therefore, for the secret word:
- Position 1 cannot be H and must be some other letter not eliminated.
- Position 4 cannot be D and must be some other letter not eliminated.

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches: [1] A N [4] Y

And the letters at position 1 and 4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding:
- C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

The full list of eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

Available letters for position 1 and 4: 
A, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y is already at position 5? But we can have another Y? But also A and N are used? We need to think about duplicates.

But at position 1 and 4? They are different positions? And we haven't been told about duplicates? So it's possible? 

But in our feedback? For example, if we guessed a duplicate letter? But we haven't had a word with duplicates so far? 

But we should consider words that fit the pattern.

Possible words matching [1] A N [4] Y:

- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> M and L available? And not eliminated? 
- ""BANDY"": B at 1, A at 2, N at 3, D at 4, Y at 5? But D eliminated? So not? Because D absent? 
- ""FANNY"": F at 1, A at 2, N at 3, N at 41? N at 3 and 4? Then pattern: F A N N Y -> N at position 4? And position 3? 
- ""WANLY"": W at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> W and L available? 
- ""CANNY"": C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"": R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"": S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"": T eliminated? 
- ""CANDY"": C eliminated? 
- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> S eliminated? 
- ""JANNY"": not common? 
- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y -> This has two N's? 

But note: ""FANNY"" is a valid word? And it has N at position 4? 

But we have feedback: 
In guess 1: crane -> N was at position 4? Marked as absent in that position? But only one mark? In ""crane"", we put N at position 4? If ""fanny"" had N at position 4? Then in the first guess? We put N at position 4? And feedback said N is present but not at position 4? Then if the word had N at position 4? It would be correct? 

But wait: in feedback for guess 1, we put N at position 4? And got ""-"" meaning the letter N is in the word but not at that position? So N cannot be at position 4? Therefore, words like ""fanny"" (with N at position 4) would be invalid? Because that would require N at position 4? But that position is forbidden? 

Similarly, ""manny"": M A N N Y? N at position 3 and 4? Position 4 would be problematic? 

So words with N at position 4 cannot be allowed? Because we already know N is not at position 4? 

Therefore, for position 4? It must not be N? 

So the fourth letter must be a different letter? Not N? 

Therefore, ""FANNY"" has N at position 4? So that's invalid? Similarly, ""BANDY"" has D (absent), etc? 

So what words remain? 

Available words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, L at 4? Letters: M, L? Both available? 
- ""WANLY"": W at 1, L at 4? 
- ""LANNY""? Not standard? 
- ""BALKY"": B at 1, K at 4? But pattern: B A L K Y -> but middle is L? But we need N at position 3? Pattern must be: position 3 is N? 

Pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: N, position4: ?, position5: Y? 

So word: ? A N ? Y? 

Therefore, ""BANKY"" not a word? 

""FANKY"" no? 

""JANKY"" slang? 

""MANKY"" not universally recognized? 

Common words: 
- ""MANLY""  
- ""WANLY"" 
- ""GANLY""? Not common? 

So only a few choices? 

Also, ""PANDY"": not ending Y? 

Therefore, ""MANLY"" or ""WANLY""? 

We haven't tested M, W, L? 

Both letters? 

We can choose? 

Perhaps ""MANLY"" is more common? 

But we need to make a guess? 

Since ""handy"" had D and H absent? 

Let me double-check if there are others? 

What about ""JANTY"" (variant of jaunty)? But pattern? J at 1? A at 2? But position3? N? It would be J A N T Y? But T eliminated? 

""VANTY""? Not English? 

So choices: ""MANLY"", ""WANLY""? 

Now, which one to guess? 

We can guess ""MANLY""? 

Then if it's wrong? We get feedback and try ""WANLY""? 

So guess ""MANLY"" 

But note: we have not tested M or L? 

So if we guess ""MANLY"" and it's wrong? We get feedback: 
- M at position 1: if absent? Marked x? 
- L at position 4: if absent? Marked x? But then we can infer and try ""WANLY""? 

But we have few guesses left? 

Therefore, we can guess ""MANLY""? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses letters we haven't tested yet? But we have to fill positions 1 and 4. 

So I choose ""MANLY"" 

<guess>manly</guess>
</think>
Here's the step-by-step reasoning based on previous feedback:

1. **Pattern from Feedback**:  
   - From Guess 2 (`nasty`), we know the second letter is **A** and the fifth letter is **Y**.
   - From Guess 3 (`handy`), we know the third letter is **N**.
   - Thus, the secret word pattern is **`_ A N _ Y`**.

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   Feedback from all guesses confirms these letters are **absent**:  
   - `crane` → C, R, E ✗  
   - `nasty` → S, T ✗  
   - `handy` → H, D ✗  
   - **Total absent letters**: **C, R, E, S, T, H, D**.  

3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Only positions **1** and **4** are unknown.
   - These positions must use letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding eliminated letters):  
     **B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  

4. **Possible Word Matches**:  
   - Common English words fitting `_ A N _ Y`:  
     - `MANLY` (M at position 1, L at position 4).  
     - `WANLY` (W at position 1, L at position 4).  
     - `GANLY` (less common, but possible).  
   - `MANLY` is prioritized as a common word that tests **M** and **L**, two new unexplored letters.

5. **Strategy**:  
   - Guess `MANLY` to verify position 1 (M) and position 4 (L).  
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject M and L, narrowing options to `WANLY` or other candidates.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,mangy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a common and effective starting word. It contains the common vowels 'A' and 'E' and the consonants 'C', 'R', 'N' which are also common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C -> x (not in the word)
 R -> x (not in the word)
 A -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 N -> - (in the word but wrong position)
 E -> x (not in the word)

 So, we know that:
 - The letters C, R, E are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the third letter and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

 Since C, R, E are absent, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

 We have two letters that are present: A and N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try a word that includes A and N, but in different positions, and avoid C, R, E.

 Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

 Let me think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, E.
 - Contains A and N, but not in the positions we tried before (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).

 Additionally, we can try other vowels and common consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: I, O, U (but we already have A, and E is absent so we don't use E)

 Let me consider possible words:

 We know A is in the word but not at position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.
 Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5.

 We should try a word that puts A and N in different positions than before.

 Also, we might try to include other common letters like T, S, L, etc.

 Since we only have two letters known to be present, we want to maximize new letters.

 Let me think of words that have A and N and three new letters (not C, R, E).

 Example words: 
 - ""PLANT"": This has P, L, A, N, T. But note we placed A at position 3? Wait, in ""PLANT"": 
      P (position1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
   However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be wrong again? 
   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it's not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.

 In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.

 What about ""PAINT""? 
   P, A, I, N, T.
   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don't want N at position 4 again.

 Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.

 How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.

 Let me avoid R.

 Another idea: ""SAINT""? 
   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new). 
   But N is at position 4 again, which we know is wrong.

 So we need a word where A and N are in positions that we haven't tried for them. For A, we tried position 3; for N, we tried position 4.

 Let me try to put A at position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5, and N at position 1,2,3,5.

 How about ""MANGO""? 
   M (new), A (at position 2), N (at position 3), G (new), O (new).
   This avoids the positions we know: A was tried at 3 and was wrong, now we try at 2. N was tried at 4 and wrong, now we try at 3.

 But note: we are not sure about the positions. This guess might help.

 Also, we must check that we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn't have them.

 Another word: ""PAINT"" was bad because of N at 4. What about ""PATIO""? 
   P, A, T, I, O.
   This doesn't include N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to verify and to get more feedback.

 Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.

 Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.

 Another word: ""STAND"": 
   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.

 How about ""SANDY"": 
   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? 
   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). 
   Also, avoids C, R, E.

 However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn't at 4.

 We don't know if N can be at 3 or not.

 So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.

 But we want to cover more common letters. Let's see:

 ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.
 ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.

 Both are valid words.

 Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? 
   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it's not there.

 Another word: ""NASTY"": 
   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). 
   Here, N at 1 (we didn't try that) and A at 2 (didn't try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.

 Also, doesn't have C, R, E.

 Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:
   - It includes A and N.
   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn't try) and A at position 2 (new).
   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.

 So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

 Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. 
   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.

 So avoid ""TAINT"".

 Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

 Let me confirm: 
   N at position 1: we don't know if that's correct or not.
   A at position 2: we don't know.
   S at position 3: new.
   T at position 4: new.
   Y at position 5: new.

 We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.

 And it doesn't contain C, R, E.

 So guess: ""NASTY"".

 We'll see the feedback and adjust.

<guess>nasty</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)
- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)

For the new guess:
1. Avoid C, R, E completely
2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)
3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)
4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:
   - Places N at position 1 (new position)
   - Places A at position 2 (new position)
   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters
   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).

Second guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it's marked as - for position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- T is not in the word at all (x).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.

Therefore, we now know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y
- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.

Also, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.

Letters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).

But note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don't know about positions 3 and 4 for N.

Also, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don't know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.

Now, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y

And we know N is in the word, but we don't know its position.

From ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, N must be at position 3.

Because:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""
- Position 2: occupied by A
- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can't be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That's right.

Wait, let me clarify:

The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).
- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).

N is present:
- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.
- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.

Therefore, N must be at position 3. Because that's the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).

So the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven't confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.

But note: we haven't tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.

So we are confident that:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.

Actually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven't seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don't know.

Wait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven't encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let's not rule it out.

However, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N's. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N's, we wouldn't necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.

But if the secret word has two N's, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven't guessed a word with two N's, we don't know.

But for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.

If the word has two N's, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? 

Alternatively, the feedback system doesn't say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N's and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N's might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N's? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. 

Similarly, for the secret word, if it has two N's, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there's at least one occurrence? But we don't get information about the count.

Therefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there's no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.

Therefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.

So the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.

We must also use only letters that haven't been eliminated and that we know are possible:

Eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.

Therefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.

But note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).

And we must avoid those absent letters.

What about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.

But also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.

But we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

And the word must be valid English.

Moreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don't know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.

Therefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.

But note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don't know?

For example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.

So we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.

Possible words? Let me think:

Common words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.

But wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.

- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N's? But we are only considering.

""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.

So ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven't confirmed it? But we don't want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?

But actually, we haven't verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it's the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But how about testing for the fourth letter? 

We know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.

We know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.

Let me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.

For example:
- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.
- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.
- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.
- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.

Also, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.

""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? 
""MANKY"": not common? 
""PANFY"": no?

""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.

Therefore, valid common words: 
- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)
- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That's allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.

But note: we don't know if D is in the word? 

Alternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). 

We want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.

But note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N's? 

However, let's think: if the word has two N's? Then one N could be at a position we haven't guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? 

For instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). 

Wait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That's not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? 

We need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? 

For example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? 

Common words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn't have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? 

We know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don't know? 

Therefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? 

Unless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5 letters? 

Therefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? 

Thus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.

We must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.

Possible words: 

- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.
- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.
- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That's fine.
- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N's? 
- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? 
- ""LANZY""? Not English?
- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? 
- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?
- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? 

We want to try to guess correctly? But we don't know which one? 

The best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? 

We have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? 

New letters could help eliminate? 

So for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? 
""MANLY"" uses M, L? 
etc. 

But if we guess and it's incorrect, we get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? 

But let's think: we have to pick one? 

I think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? 

So I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? 

""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.

If we guess ""HANDY"", and it's the word? We win? 

If not, we'll get feedback and continue? 

But note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?

But another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

But since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? 

Actually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.

We need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? 

Likely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? 

But common letters? 

For example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? 

Actually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? 

Similarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? 

So the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth? And an N in third? 

So like: * A N * Y? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY"" (adj) 
- ""BANDY"" (verb) 
- ""DANDY"" (noun) 
- ""FANNY"" (noun) 
- ""HANDY"" (adj) 
- ""CANDY"" (noun) -> but C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"" (adj) -> R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"" (adj) -> S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"" (adj) -> T eliminated? 
- ""WANLY"" (adv) -> word: W A N L Y? 
- ""DANCY"" -> not common? 

So eliminated: C, R, E, S, T? So the words left? 
- ""BANDY"", ""DANDY"", ""FANNY"", ""HANDY"", ""MANLY"", ""WANLY"", etc? 

We can also have ""PANSY""? P A N S Y? But S eliminated? 

So no? 

Then the candidates: 
Band of brothers: ""BANDY"" 
Dandy: ""DANDY"" 
Fanny: ""FANNY"" 
Handy: ""HANDY"" 
Manly: ""MANLY"" 
Wanly: ""WANLY"" 

We haven't tested: B, D, F, H, M, W? 

We haven't tested L? but in ""manly"" we have L? 

We want to make a guess that can help if it's not correct? 

But actually, we can choose one: ""HANDY"" seems very popular? 

But let me think: we also want to avoid worst-case? 

But time is short? 

I think we should try ""HANDY""? 

Alternatively, we could choose ""BANDY"" or another? 

But note: if we choose a word that has as many letters as possible not used? 

For example, if we guess ""BANDY"", we test B and D? 

If we guess ""MANLY"", we test M and L? 

But ""MANLY"" has L? Which is common? 

We might get more information? 

But since we might win immediately? 

The goal is to minimize the number of guesses? But we don't know which one? 

Perhaps we can guess a word that uses only one of the unknowns? But that doesn't exist? 

So I decide to go with ""HANDY"". 

If it's not, we'll see? 

Therefore, guess: ""HANDY""

<guess>handy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane → C(✗) R(✗) A(➖) N(➖) E(✗)**  
  This indicates:
  - C, R, E are **absent** in the secret word.
  - A is **present** but not in position 3.
  - N is **present** but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: nasty → N(➖) A(✓) S(✗) T(✗) Y(✓)**  
  This indicates:
  - N is **present** but not in position 1.
  - A is **present** and in the **correct position (position 2)**.
  - S and T are **absent**.
  - Y is **present** and in the **correct position (position 5)**.

### Key deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? Y** (A in position 2, Y in position 5).
2. **N is present** but:
   - Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback).
   - Not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).
   - Not at position 2 (A) or 5 (Y), so it **must be at position 3**.
3. Thus, the pattern is now: **? A N ? Y**.
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T (cannot be used).
5. **Present letters**: A (fixed position 2), N (position 3), Y (fixed position 5).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4.
- Possible candidates include **HANDY**, **MANLY**, **BANDY**, **DANDY**, **FANNY**, or **WANLY**.
- **HANDY** is a common English word that fits the pattern and tests common consonants (H, D) not yet used.
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm/reject H and D, narrowing future guesses.

<guess>handy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3.
- N is present but not in position 4.

Guess 2: nasty -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- N is present but not in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- S and T are absent.
- Y is correct in position 5.

Guess 3: handy -> Feedback: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- H is absent (x).
- A is correct in position 2 (✓ already knew).
- N is correct in position 3 (✓).
- D is absent (x).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).

So now we know:
- The secret word pattern: ? A N ? Y  (positions: 2=A, 3=N, 5=Y)
- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: A, N, Y.
- We need to find the letter for position 1 and position 4.
- But note: from guess 3, D is absent, and H is absent.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated:
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

Also, we have used:
- A, N, Y are confirmed and in correct positions.

Now, the word pattern is: [1] A N [4] Y

We know that the first letter position and the fourth letter position must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

We have guessed ""handy"" and now know that D and H are absent.

But note: ""handy"" has A at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), and Y at 5 (correct). The first letter H was absent, and the fourth letter D was absent.

Therefore, for the secret word:
- Position 1 cannot be H and must be some other letter not eliminated.
- Position 4 cannot be D and must be some other letter not eliminated.

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches: [1] A N [4] Y

And the letters at position 1 and 4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding:
- C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

The full list of eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.

Available letters for position 1 and 4: 
A, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: Y is already at position 5? But we can have another Y? But also A and N are used? We need to think about duplicates.

But at position 1 and 4? They are different positions? And we haven't been told about duplicates? So it's possible? 

But in our feedback? For example, if we guessed a duplicate letter? But we haven't had a word with duplicates so far? 

But we should consider words that fit the pattern.

Possible words matching [1] A N [4] Y:

- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> M and L available? And not eliminated? 
- ""BANDY"": B at 1, A at 2, N at 3, D at 4, Y at 5? But D eliminated? So not? Because D absent? 
- ""FANNY"": F at 1, A at 2, N at 3, N at 41? N at 3 and 4? Then pattern: F A N N Y -> N at position 4? And position 3? 
- ""WANLY"": W at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> W and L available? 
- ""CANNY"": C eliminated? 
- ""RANDY"": R eliminated? 
- ""SANDY"": S eliminated? 
- ""TANGY"": T eliminated? 
- ""CANDY"": C eliminated? 
- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> S eliminated? 
- ""JANNY"": not common? 
- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y -> This has two N's? 

But note: ""FANNY"" is a valid word? And it has N at position 4? 

But we have feedback: 
In guess 1: crane -> N was at position 4? Marked as absent in that position? But only one mark? In ""crane"", we put N at position 4? If ""fanny"" had N at position 4? Then in the first guess? We put N at position 4? And feedback said N is present but not at position 4? Then if the word had N at position 4? It would be correct? 

But wait: in feedback for guess 1, we put N at position 4? And got ""-"" meaning the letter N is in the word but not at that position? So N cannot be at position 4? Therefore, words like ""fanny"" (with N at position 4) would be invalid? Because that would require N at position 4? But that position is forbidden? 

Similarly, ""manny"": M A N N Y? N at position 3 and 4? Position 4 would be problematic? 

So words with N at position 4 cannot be allowed? Because we already know N is not at position 4? 

Therefore, for position 4? It must not be N? 

So the fourth letter must be a different letter? Not N? 

Therefore, ""FANNY"" has N at position 4? So that's invalid? Similarly, ""BANDY"" has D (absent), etc? 

So what words remain? 

Available words: 
- ""MANLY"": M at 1, L at 4? Letters: M, L? Both available? 
- ""WANLY"": W at 1, L at 4? 
- ""LANNY""? Not standard? 
- ""BALKY"": B at 1, K at 4? But pattern: B A L K Y -> but middle is L? But we need N at position 3? Pattern must be: position 3 is N? 

Pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: N, position4: ?, position5: Y? 

So word: ? A N ? Y? 

Therefore, ""BANKY"" not a word? 

""FANKY"" no? 

""JANKY"" slang? 

""MANKY"" not universally recognized? 

Common words: 
- ""MANLY""  
- ""WANLY"" 
- ""GANLY""? Not common? 

So only a few choices? 

Also, ""PANDY"": not ending Y? 

Therefore, ""MANLY"" or ""WANLY""? 

We haven't tested M, W, L? 

Both letters? 

We can choose? 

Perhaps ""MANLY"" is more common? 

But we need to make a guess? 

Since ""handy"" had D and H absent? 

Let me double-check if there are others? 

What about ""JANTY"" (variant of jaunty)? But pattern? J at 1? A at 2? But position3? N? It would be J A N T Y? But T eliminated? 

""VANTY""? Not English? 

So choices: ""MANLY"", ""WANLY""? 

Now, which one to guess? 

We can guess ""MANLY""? 

Then if it's wrong? We get feedback and try ""WANLY""? 

So guess ""MANLY"" 

But note: we have not tested M or L? 

So if we guess ""MANLY"" and it's wrong? We get feedback: 
- M at position 1: if absent? Marked x? 
- L at position 4: if absent? Marked x? But then we can infer and try ""WANLY""? 

But we have few guesses left? 

Therefore, we can guess ""MANLY""? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses letters we haven't tested yet? But we have to fill positions 1 and 4. 

So I choose ""MANLY"" 

<guess>manly</guess>Here's the step-by-step reasoning based on previous feedback:

1. **Pattern from Feedback**:  
   - From Guess 2 (`nasty`), we know the second letter is **A** and the fifth letter is **Y**.
   - From Guess 3 (`handy`), we know the third letter is **N**.
   - Thus, the secret word pattern is **`_ A N _ Y`**.

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   Feedback from all guesses confirms these letters are **absent**:  
   - `crane` → C, R, E ✗  
   - `nasty` → S, T ✗  
   - `handy` → H, D ✗  
   - **Total absent letters**: **C, R, E, S, T, H, D**.  

3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Only positions **1** and **4** are unknown.
   - These positions must use letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding eliminated letters):  
     **B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  

4. **Possible Word Matches**:  
   - Common English words fitting `_ A N _ Y`:  
     - `MANLY` (M at position 1, L at position 4).  
     - `WANLY` (W at position 1, L at position 4).  
     - `GANLY` (less common, but possible).  
   - `MANLY` is prioritized as a common word that tests **M** and **L**, two new unexplored letters.

5. **Strategy**:  
   - Guess `MANLY` to verify position 1 (M) and position 4 (L).  
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject M and L, narrowing options to `WANLY` or other candidates.

We should try a word that includes A and N, but in different positions, and avoid C, R, E.\n\n Also, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\n Let me think of a word that:\n - Does not contain C, R, E.\n - Contains A and N, but not in the positions we tried before (so A not at position 3, N not at position 4).\n\n Additionally, we can try other vowels and common consonants.\n\n Common vowels remaining: I, O, U (but we already have A, and E is absent so we don\'t use E)\n\n Let me consider possible words:\n\n We know A is in the word but not at position 3. Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n Similarly, N is in the word but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n We should try a word that puts A and N in different positions than before.\n\n Also, we might try to include other common letters like T, S, L, etc.\n\n Since we only have two letters known to be present, we want to maximize new letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and N and three new letters (not C, R, E).\n\n Example words: \n - ""PLANT"": This has P, L, A, N, T. But note we placed A at position 3? Wait, in ""PLANT"": \n      P (position1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). \n   However, in our first guess, A was in position 3 and was wrong, so if we put A at position 3 again, it will be wrong again? \n   Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3, so we know it\'s not at 3. Therefore, we should try A in a different position.\n\n In ""PLANT"", A is at position 3 again. So that would be a bad choice.\n\n What about ""PAINT""? \n   P, A, I, N, T.\n   Here, A is at position 2 (which is new), N is at position 4? But in our first guess, N was in position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we don\'t want N at position 4 again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, which we know is wrong.\n\n How about ""TRAIN""? But T is allowed? Wait, we are avoiding R? Yes, R is not in the word (we got R as x), so we cannot use R.\n\n Let me avoid R.\n\n Another idea: ""SAINT""? \n   S (new), A (at position 2), I (new), N (at position 4), T (new). \n   But N is at position 4 again, which we know is wrong.\n\n So we need a word where A and N are in positions that we haven\'t tried for them. For A, we tried position 3; for N, we tried position 4.\n\n Let me try to put A at position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5, and N at position 1,2,3,5.\n\n How about ""MANGO""? \n   M (new), A (at position 2), N (at position 3), G (new), O (new).\n   This avoids the positions we know: A was tried at 3 and was wrong, now we try at 2. N was tried at 4 and wrong, now we try at 3.\n\n But note: we are not sure about the positions. This guess might help.\n\n Also, we must check that we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, E. ""MANGO"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Another word: ""PAINT"" was bad because of N at 4. What about ""PATIO""? \n   P, A, T, I, O.\n   This doesn\'t include N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to verify and to get more feedback.\n\n Since we have two known letters (A and N), we should try to include both.\n\n Therefore, ""MANGO"" is a good candidate.\n\n Another word: ""STAND"": \n   S, T, A, N, D -> A at position 3 (tried and wrong) and N at position 4 (tried and wrong). So no.\n\n How about ""SANDY"": \n   S, A, N, D, Y -> A at position 2, N at position 3? \n   So A not at 3 (we are trying at 2) and N not at 4 (we are trying at 3). \n   Also, avoids C, R, E.\n\n However, note that in the feedback we got, A is present but not at position 3, so putting A at position 2 is okay. Similarly, N at 3 is okay because it wasn\'t at 4.\n\n We don\'t know if N can be at 3 or not.\n\n So both ""MANGO"" and ""SANDY"" are options.\n\n But we want to cover more common letters. Let\'s see:\n\n ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O -> letters: M, A, N, G, O.\n ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y.\n\n Both are valid words.\n\n Alternatively, ""SAUNA""? \n   S, A, U, N, A -> but duplicate A? And positions: A at position 2 and 5, N at position 4 -> but N at 4 is bad because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Another word: ""NASTY"": \n   N (position1), A (position2), S (position3), T (position4), Y (position5). \n   Here, N at 1 (we didn\'t try that) and A at 2 (didn\'t try that), and avoids N at 4 and A at 3.\n\n Also, doesn\'t have C, R, E.\n\n Therefore, ""NASTY"" is an excellent candidate because:\n   - It includes A and N.\n   - It tests N at position 1 (which we didn\'t try) and A at position 2 (new).\n   - And it introduces S, T, Y which are common.\n\n So I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""TAINT"", but that has a T at the beginning and duplicate T? Wait, ""TAINT"": T, A, I, N, T. \n   Positions: A at 2, N at 4? Again, N at 4 is forbidden because we know N is not in the word at position 4.\n\n So avoid ""TAINT"".\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".\n\n Let me confirm: \n   N at position 1: we don\'t know if that\'s correct or not.\n   A at position 2: we don\'t know.\n   S at position 3: new.\n   T at position 4: new.\n   Y at position 5: new.\n\n We hope that if the word has S, T, Y, we might get information.\n\n And it doesn\'t contain C, R, E.\n\n So guess: ""NASTY"".\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and adjust.\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>Based on the previous feedback from ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are ABSENT in the secret word (marked ✗)\n- A and N are PRESENT but in different positions (marked ➖)\n\nFor the new guess:\n1. Avoid C, R, E completely\n2. Include A and N in different positions than tried before (A was position 3, N position 4)\n3. Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y)\n4. ""NASTY"" meets these criteria:\n   - Places N at position 1 (new position)\n   - Places A at position 2 (new position)\n   - Introduces S, T, Y as new letters\n   - Excludes forbidden letters (C, R, E)\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nThis means:\n- C, R, E are not in the word at all.\n- A is in the word but not in the third position (since it was guessed at position 3 and got -).\n- N is in the word but not in the fourth position (guessed at position 4, got -).\n\nSecond guess: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word but not at position 1 (since it\'s marked as - for position 1).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2 (because in ""nasty"", A is the second letter and got ✓). So the second letter of the secret word is A.\n- S is not in the word at all (x).\n- T is not in the word at all (x).\n- Y is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (because in ""nasty"", Y is the fifth letter and got ✓). So the fifth letter of the secret word is Y.\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n- Second letter: A, Fifth letter: Y.\n\nAlso, letters that are definitely absent: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nLetters that are present: A, N, Y (and we know A and Y are in positions 2 and 5 respectively).\n\nBut note: we have N somewhere in the word, but not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback) and not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback? In ""crane"", N was at position 4 and was wrong, and now we have feedback from ""nasty"" that N is present but not at position 1). Also, we don\'t know about positions 3 and 4 for N.\n\nAlso, we have used all vowels: A and Y (Y is sometimes a vowel) but we also have to consider other vowels: E is absent, so only I and O and U remain? But we don\'t know. And consonants: we have eliminated several.\n\nNow, we know the word pattern: _ A _ _ Y\n\nAnd we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know its position.\n\nFrom ""crane"": N was at position 4 (marked -) and we now know that N is not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") and cannot be at position 2 (which is A) or position 5 (which is Y). Therefore, N must be either position 3 or position 4? But wait, in ""crane"", position 4 was N and it was marked wrong. Therefore, N cannot be at position 4.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 3.\n\nBecause:\n- Position 1: ruled out by ""nasty""\n- Position 2: occupied by A\n- Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" (since it was placed there and marked absent in that position? Actually, marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Yes, so it can\'t be at position 4 because the feedback says it was in the word but not in position 4? So then it can be position 3 only? That\'s right.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n- Position 2 is A (from guess 2).\n- Position 5 is Y (from guess 2).\n\nN is present:\n- In guess ""crane"", N was at position 4, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 4.\n- In guess ""nasty"", N was at position 1, marked ""-"", meaning N is not at position 1.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 3. Because that\'s the only position left? Positions: 1 (no), 2 (no, occupied by A), 3 (available), 4 (no), 5 (occupied by Y).\n\nSo the secret word must be: _ A N _ Y? But wait, we haven\'t confirmed position 3. However, logically, since N is in the word and not at 1,4 and 2,5 are taken, then position 3 must be N.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tried position 3 yet, but the presence of N means it must be somewhere, and these are the only possibilities.\n\nSo we are confident that:\n- Position 2: A\n- Position 3: N? Wait, we are extrapolating. But let me double-check.\n\nActually, we know N cannot be at positions 1 and 4. The remaining positions are 3. Position 5 is taken by Y? Position 5 is Y, so N cannot be there either? Because each letter is distinct? Not necessarily: words can have repeated letters? But we haven\'t seen any feedback suggesting duplicates, and in fact, we don\'t know.\n\nWait: the word could have duplicate letters? For example, if N appears twice? But so far, we haven\'t encountered that possibility. But to be safe, let\'s not rule it out.\n\nHowever, in feedback from ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we only saw one N and it was marked as present. So if N were duplicated, the feedback would have marked two N\'s. Since we only saw one N in each guess, it might mean there is only one N? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" showed a ""-"" for N (at position 4) and for ""nasty"" a ""-"" for N (at position 1). But if there were two N\'s, we wouldn\'t necessarily see two marks? The feedback marks each occurrence independently? Yes, but we only have one N in each guess.\n\nBut if the secret word has two N\'s, then guessing a word with one N would still get one mark. Since we haven\'t guessed a word with two N\'s, we don\'t know.\n\nBut for now, based on the feedback, we know N is in the word at least once. And the positions excluded for N are 1 and 4. Also, position 2 and 5 are occupied by A and Y, respectively. So if we assume the word has only one N, then it must be at position 3.\n\nIf the word has two N\'s, then it could be at position 3 and, say, position 1? But no, because position 1 showed no N (and we got a ""-"" meaning it is present but not at position 1? Wait, no: ""-"" means the letter is present but in the wrong position. That implies the letter is in the word somewhere else. Since we know position 2 is fixed as A and 5 as Y, the only other possibilities are 3 and 4? But we know it cannot be at 4 because when we put it at 4 we got ""-"", which means there is another occurrence? But that could already be position 3? So it might be at position 3? \n\nAlternatively, the feedback system doesn\'t say how many occurrences? So if the word has two N\'s and we put N at position 1, which is not correct for N, but one of the N\'s might be at position 3? then we should get a ""-"" for the N at position 1? And if we also have an N at position 3? Then we would get two ""-"" for both N\'s? But we only have one N in ""nasty"", so one mark. \n\nSimilarly, for the secret word, if it has two N\'s, then when we guessed ""nasty"" we got one ""-"" meaning there\'s at least one occurrence? But we don\'t get information about the count.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we should allow for multiple occurrences, but in practice since we eliminated positions 1 and 4 for N, and positions 2 and 5 are different letters, then if there is an N, it must be at position 3. Because there\'s no other position? Unless we missed a position? Well, positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is Y. So only position 3 is available? Therefore, N must be at position 3? But that means the word has an N at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct pattern is: _ A N _ Y.\n\nSo the secret word starts with some letter (unknown), then A at position 2, then N at position 3, then something at position 4, and Y at position 5.\n\nWe must also use only letters that haven\'t been eliminated and that we know are possible:\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nMoreover, from ""crane"", we have absent C, R, E. From ""nasty"", absent S, T.\n\nTherefore, absent letters: C, R, E, S, T.\n\nBut note: we used other letters: for example, in ""crane"" and ""nasty"", we used A, N, Y (which are present) and C, R, E (absent) and S, T (absent).\n\nAnd we must avoid those absent letters.\n\nWhat about other vowels? Only I, O, U remain.\n\nBut also consonants: remaining consonants are many: B, D, F, G, H, I (if considered vowel?), J, K, L, M, O (vowel?), P, Q, U (vowel?), V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut we need a 5-letter word that fits: [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.\n\nAnd the word must be valid English.\n\nMoreover, we know that the first letter cannot be C, R, E, S, T? Actually, we don\'t know any constraints on the first letter? But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid C, R, E, S, T.\n\nTherefore, we must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the remaining letters.\n\nBut note: we might have more constraints: we used other letters that we don\'t know?\n\nFor example, we used ""crane"" and ""nasty"", so we also had L (from ""crane""? Wait, no: letters we used: crane: C, R, A, N, E. Nasty: N, A, S, T, Y.\n\nSo we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut some of these are vowels? Actually, I, O, U are vowels, but Y is already used.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: $word = [letter1] A N [letter4] Y.\n\nPossible words? Let me think:\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? Letters: M, A, N, L, Y -> valid, and M and L are allowed? But check if any are eliminated? M and L are not eliminated.\n\nBut wait, we know Y is at the end? And pattern matches.\n\n- ""CANNY"": but C is eliminated? We know C is absent? So C cannot be used? Also, ""can"" has C? So ""CANNY"" has two N\'s? But we are only considering.\n\n""CANNY"": C(1) A(2) N(3) N(4) Y(5) -> but C is absent? So ""CANNY"" would be invalid because we know C is absent? So we cannot guess words with C or other eliminated letters.\n\nSo ""MANLY"" is a candidate? But note: in ""MANLY"", N at position 3 is the same as we deduced? And we haven\'t confirmed it? But we don\'t want to waste a guess if we are sure. Or do we?\n\nBut actually, we haven\'t verified that position 3 is N? So we might try to construct a word that verifies N is at position 3 and also tests other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly guess ""MANLY"" because if it\'s the word, we win. If not, we get feedback.\n\nBut how about testing for the fourth letter? \n\nWe know the pattern: [1]A N [4]Y.\n\nWe know the fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""MANKY""? Not really a common word? But we need valid English words.\n\nLet me think of words that end in NY? Actually, ending in NY: with AN in the middle? So ?AN?Y.\n\nFor example:\n- ""FANCY"": but F A N C Y? C is eliminated? So no.\n- ""TANGO"": T is eliminated? ""TANGO"" has T? So no.\n- ""BANDY"": B A N D Y? This looks good? B, D not eliminated.\n- ""DANDY"": D A N D Y? Duplicate D? And D is used? Also, not necessarily bad? But D is allowed? But let me check: ""DANDY"" is a word? Meaning: stylish? Yes.\n\nAlso, ""MANGA""? Not English? ""Manga""? Not really? Plus, ends with A, not Y? The word must end with Y.\n\n""MANLY"": as above? Valid? Meaning: masculine? \n""MANKY"": not common? \n""PANFY"": no?\n\n""BANAL"": no, ends with L, not Y.\n\nTherefore, valid common words: \n- ""BANDY"" (B becomes first, D becomes fourth)\n- ""DANDY"" (D becomes first and fourth? D at position 1 and 4? But the fourth position is the fourth letter? But ""dandy"" has D two times? That\'s allowed? Then the first letter D and the fourth letter D? So we can guess that? But if we guess ""DANDY"", we might get feedback to see if D is in the word.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if D is in the word? \n\nAlternatively, ""MANLY"" (M at 1, L at 4). \n\nWe want to test multiple possibilities? Or we can pick one that uses the exact pattern we deduced.\n\nBut note: we deduced that position 3 must be N? But that deduction might be wrong? Because if the word has two N\'s? \n\nHowever, let\'s think: if the word has two N\'s? Then one N could be at a position we haven\'t guessed? For example, position 3 and position 4? But we guessed position 4 in ""crane"" and got ""-"", meaning there is an N but not at position 4? That is, if there is an N at position 4, we would have gotten a ""✓"" when we put it there? No, because position 4 we put N in ""crane"" and got ""-"", which means the N is not at position 4? Even if there is another N? Because each letter is evaluated independently. So when we put N at position 4, since the letter N is present and position 4 is not the correct position for that particular occurrence? It could be that the secret word has an N at position 3 and we put N at position 4? Then the N at position 4 in our guess? The feedback would mark the N at position 4 as ""-"" if there is an N elsewhere, even if an N is at position 3? Then we are not forced to have N at position 3? \n\nFor instance, suppose the secret word is ""DAILY"" (but does it have A? Not at position 2? And N? No). \n\nWait, let me denote: suppose the secret word is ""FOYNY""? That\'s not English? Or ""FOYNE""? Not English? \n\nWe need a valid English word: with second letter A and fifth letter Y? \n\nFor example, ""BAYNY""? Not English? \n\nCommon words: ""PAPPY""? But doesn\'t have N? We must have N? Because we saw it in feedback? \n\nWe know N is present? So the word has N? But multiple? We don\'t know? \n\nTherefore, the pattern: _ A _ _ Y? And we know N is present? But not at position 1 or 4? Then it must be at position 3? Because we have positions: 1,2,3,4,5? The word must have at least one N? And from feedback, position 1 and 4 cannot have N? So only position 3? Because position 2 is A and position 5 is Y? \n\nUnless the word has more than 5 letters? No, it\'s 5 letters? \n\nTherefore, the only possibility for N is position 3? So we can be certain? \n\nThus, the secret word pattern is: ? A N ? Y.\n\nWe must choose the first letter and the fourth letter from the available alphabet, excluding C, R, E, S, T.\n\nPossible words: \n\n- ""MANLY"": M, A, N, L, Y -> valid.\n- ""BANDY"": B, A, N, D, Y -> valid.\n- ""DANDY"": D, A, N, D, Y -> valid? Double D? That\'s fine.\n- ""FANNY"": F, A, N, N, Y -> double N? Also valid? But does it require two N\'s? \n- ""CANNy"": C eliminated? \n- ""LANZY""? Not English?\n- ""WANLY"": W, A, N, L, Y? Valid? \n- ""HANDY"": H, A, N, D, Y? Valid?\n- ""PANDY""? Valid? Not common? \n\nWe want to try to guess correctly? But we don\'t know which one? \n\nThe best thing is to pick one? Or pick a word that also introduces new letters? \n\nWe have used: A, N, Y, C, R, E, S, T? \n\nNew letters could help eliminate? \n\nSo for example, ""BANDY"" uses B, D? \n""MANLY"" uses M, L? \netc. \n\nBut if we guess and it\'s incorrect, we get feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that only uses one missing letter? \n\nBut let\'s think: we have to pick one? \n\nI think we should guess a word that might be the solution? Given the pattern? \n\nSo I propose to guess ""HANDY"", which is a common word? Meaning: useful? \n\n""HANDY"": H at 1, A at 2, N at 3 (assumed), D at 4, Y at 5.\n\nIf we guess ""HANDY"", and it\'s the word? We win? \n\nIf not, we\'ll get feedback and continue? \n\nBut note: we have only 4 more tries? But we have many? Then we can make a guess?\n\nBut another idea: we can choose a word that has many common letters? \n\nBut since we only have two unknowns: first and fourth? \n\nActually, we can list the known pattern: [1st] A N [4th] Y.\n\nWe need to choose letters for 1st and 4th? \n\nLikely letters: since the word must be English? For example, first letter: any consonant? And fourth letter: could be a vowel? Or consonant? \n\nBut common letters? \n\nFor example, ""FUNNY""? But with U? \n\nActually, ""FUNNY"": F U N N Y? But pattern: F at1? U at2? No: the pattern must be: letter at1? Then A at2? But ""FUNNY"" has A? It has F at1, U at2, N at3, N at4, Y at5? But U at2? But the second letter must be A! So that disqualifies? \n\nSimilarly, we must have A at the second position? So the word? \n\nSo the only words are those that have A in second and Y in fifth? And an N in third? \n\nSo like: * A N * Y? \n\nPossible words: \n- ""MANLY"" (adj) \n- ""BANDY"" (verb) \n- ""DANDY"" (noun) \n- ""FANNY"" (noun) \n- ""HANDY"" (adj) \n- ""CANDY"" (noun) -> but C eliminated? \n- ""RANDY"" (adj) -> R eliminated? \n- ""SANDY"" (adj) -> S eliminated? \n- ""TANGY"" (adj) -> T eliminated? \n- ""WANLY"" (adv) -> word: W A N L Y? \n- ""DANCY"" -> not common? \n\nSo eliminated: C, R, E, S, T? So the words left? \n- ""BANDY"", ""DANDY"", ""FANNY"", ""HANDY"", ""MANLY"", ""WANLY"", etc? \n\nWe can also have ""PANSY""? P A N S Y? But S eliminated? \n\nSo no? \n\nThen the candidates: \nBand of brothers: ""BANDY"" \nDandy: ""DANDY"" \nFanny: ""FANNY"" \nHandy: ""HANDY"" \nManly: ""MANLY"" \nWanly: ""WANLY"" \n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, H, M, W? \n\nWe haven\'t tested L? but in ""manly"" we have L? \n\nWe want to make a guess that can help if it\'s not correct? \n\nBut actually, we can choose one: ""HANDY"" seems very popular? \n\nBut let me think: we also want to avoid worst-case? \n\nBut time is short? \n\nI think we should try ""HANDY""? \n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""BANDY"" or another? \n\nBut note: if we choose a word that has as many letters as possible not used? \n\nFor example, if we guess ""BANDY"", we test B and D? \n\nIf we guess ""MANLY"", we test M and L? \n\nBut ""MANLY"" has L? Which is common? \n\nWe might get more information? \n\nBut since we might win immediately? \n\nThe goal is to minimize the number of guesses? But we don\'t know which one? \n\nPerhaps we can guess a word that uses only one of the unknowns? But that doesn\'t exist? \n\nSo I decide to go with ""HANDY"". \n\nIf it\'s not, we\'ll see? \n\nTherefore, guess: ""HANDY""\n\n<guess>handy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → C(✗) R(✗) A(➖) N(➖) E(✗)**  \n  This indicates:\n  - C, R, E are **absent** in the secret word.\n  - A is **present** but not in position 3.\n  - N is **present** but not in position 4.\n\n- **Guess 2: nasty → N(➖) A(✓) S(✗) T(✗) Y(✓)**  \n  This indicates:\n  - N is **present** but not in position 1.\n  - A is **present** and in the **correct position (position 2)**.\n  - S and T are **absent**.\n  - Y is **present** and in the **correct position (position 5)**.\n\n### Key deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? Y** (A in position 2, Y in position 5).\n2. **N is present** but:\n   - Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"" feedback).\n   - Not at position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback).\n   - Not at position 2 (A) or 5 (Y), so it **must be at position 3**.\n3. Thus, the pattern is now: **? A N ? Y**.\n4. **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T (cannot be used).\n5. **Present letters**: A (fixed position 2), N (position 3), Y (fixed position 5).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- The unknown letters are at positions 1 and 4.\n- Possible candidates include **HANDY**, **MANLY**, **BANDY**, **DANDY**, **FANNY**, or **WANLY**.\n- **HANDY** is a common English word that fits the pattern and tests common consonants (H, D) not yet used.\n- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm/reject H and D, narrowing future guesses.\n\n<guess>handy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, E are absent.\n- A is present but not in position 3.\n- N is present but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: nasty -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nMeaning:\n- N is present but not in position 1.\n- A is correct in position 2.\n- S and T are absent.\n- Y is correct in position 5.\n\nGuess 3: handy -> Feedback: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nMeaning:\n- H is absent (x).\n- A is correct in position 2 (✓ already knew).\n- N is correct in position 3 (✓).\n- D is absent (x).\n- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word pattern: ? A N ? Y  (positions: 2=A, 3=N, 5=Y)\n- Positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed: A, N, Y.\n- We need to find the letter for position 1 and position 4.\n- But note: from guess 3, D is absent, and H is absent.\n\nAdditionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated:\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.\n\nAlso, we have used:\n- A, N, Y are confirmed and in correct positions.\n\nNow, the word pattern is: [1] A N [4] Y\n\nWe know that the first letter position and the fourth letter position must not be any of the eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.\n\nWe have guessed ""handy"" and now know that D and H are absent.\n\nBut note: ""handy"" has A at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), and Y at 5 (correct). The first letter H was absent, and the fourth letter D was absent.\n\nTherefore, for the secret word:\n- Position 1 cannot be H and must be some other letter not eliminated.\n- Position 4 cannot be D and must be some other letter not eliminated.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that matches: [1] A N [4] Y\n\nAnd the letters at position 1 and 4 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding:\n- C, R, E, S, T, H, D.\n\nThe full list of eliminated letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D.\n\nAvailable letters for position 1 and 4: \nA, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: Y is already at position 5? But we can have another Y? But also A and N are used? We need to think about duplicates.\n\nBut at position 1 and 4? They are different positions? And we haven\'t been told about duplicates? So it\'s possible? \n\nBut in our feedback? For example, if we guessed a duplicate letter? But we haven\'t had a word with duplicates so far? \n\nBut we should consider words that fit the pattern.\n\nPossible words matching [1] A N [4] Y:\n\n- ""MANLY"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> M and L available? And not eliminated? \n- ""BANDY"": B at 1, A at 2, N at 3, D at 4, Y at 5? But D eliminated? So not? Because D absent? \n- ""FANNY"": F at 1, A at 2, N at 3, N at 41? N at 3 and 4? Then pattern: F A N N Y -> N at position 4? And position 3? \n- ""WANLY"": W at 1, A at 2, N at 3, L at 4, Y at 5 -> W and L available? \n- ""CANNY"": C eliminated? \n- ""RANDY"": R eliminated? \n- ""SANDY"": S eliminated? \n- ""TANGY"": T eliminated? \n- ""CANDY"": C eliminated? \n- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> S eliminated? \n- ""JANNY"": not common? \n- ""FANNY"": F A N N Y -> This has two N\'s? \n\nBut note: ""FANNY"" is a valid word? And it has N at position 4? \n\nBut we have feedback: \nIn guess 1: crane -> N was at position 4? Marked as absent in that position? But only one mark? In ""crane"", we put N at position 4? If ""fanny"" had N at position 4? Then in the first guess? We put N at position 4? And feedback said N is present but not at position 4? Then if the word had N at position 4? It would be correct? \n\nBut wait: in feedback for guess 1, we put N at position 4? And got ""-"" meaning the letter N is in the word but not at that position? So N cannot be at position 4? Therefore, words like ""fanny"" (with N at position 4) would be invalid? Because that would require N at position 4? But that position is forbidden? \n\nSimilarly, ""manny"": M A N N Y? N at position 3 and 4? Position 4 would be problematic? \n\nSo words with N at position 4 cannot be allowed? Because we already know N is not at position 4? \n\nTherefore, for position 4? It must not be N? \n\nSo the fourth letter must be a different letter? Not N? \n\nTherefore, ""FANNY"" has N at position 4? So that\'s invalid? Similarly, ""BANDY"" has D (absent), etc? \n\nSo what words remain? \n\nAvailable words: \n- ""MANLY"": M at 1, L at 4? Letters: M, L? Both available? \n- ""WANLY"": W at 1, L at 4? \n- ""LANNY""? Not standard? \n- ""BALKY"": B at 1, K at 4? But pattern: B A L K Y -> but middle is L? But we need N at position 3? Pattern must be: position 3 is N? \n\nPattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: N, position4: ?, position5: Y? \n\nSo word: ? A N ? Y? \n\nTherefore, ""BANKY"" not a word? \n\n""FANKY"" no? \n\n""JANKY"" slang? \n\n""MANKY"" not universally recognized? \n\nCommon words: \n- ""MANLY""  \n- ""WANLY"" \n- ""GANLY""? Not common? \n\nSo only a few choices? \n\nAlso, ""PANDY"": not ending Y? \n\nTherefore, ""MANLY"" or ""WANLY""? \n\nWe haven\'t tested M, W, L? \n\nBoth letters? \n\nWe can choose? \n\nPerhaps ""MANLY"" is more common? \n\nBut we need to make a guess? \n\nSince ""handy"" had D and H absent? \n\nLet me double-check if there are others? \n\nWhat about ""JANTY"" (variant of jaunty)? But pattern? J at 1? A at 2? But position3? N? It would be J A N T Y? But T eliminated? \n\n""VANTY""? Not English? \n\nSo choices: ""MANLY"", ""WANLY""? \n\nNow, which one to guess? \n\nWe can guess ""MANLY""? \n\nThen if it\'s wrong? We get feedback and try ""WANLY""? \n\nSo guess ""MANLY"" \n\nBut note: we have not tested M or L? \n\nSo if we guess ""MANLY"" and it\'s wrong? We get feedback: \n- M at position 1: if absent? Marked x? \n- L at position 4: if absent? Marked x? But then we can infer and try ""WANLY""? \n\nBut we have few guesses left? \n\nTherefore, we can guess ""MANLY""? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses letters we haven\'t tested yet? But we have to fill positions 1 and 4. \n\nSo I choose ""MANLY"" \n\n<guess>manly</guess>Here\'s the step-by-step reasoning based on previous feedback:\n\n1. **Pattern from Feedback**:  \n   - From Guess 2 (`nasty`), we know the second letter is **A** and the fifth letter is **Y**.\n   - From Guess 3 (`handy`), we know the third letter is **N**.\n   - Thus, the secret word pattern is **`_ A N _ Y`**.\n\n2. **Eliminated Letters**:  \n   Feedback from all guesses confirms these letters are **absent**:  \n   - `crane` → C, R, E ✗  \n   - `nasty` → S, T ✗  \n   - `handy` → H, D ✗  \n   - **Total absent letters**: **C, R, E, S, T, H, D**.  \n\n3. **Remaining Unknowns**:  \n   - Only positions **1** and **4** are unknown.\n   - These positions must use letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding eliminated letters):  \n     **B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.  \n\n4. **Possible Word Matches**:  \n   - Common English words fitting `_ A N _ Y`:  \n     - `MANLY` (M at position 1, L at position 4).  \n     - `WANLY` (W at position 1, L at position 4).  \n     - `GANLY` (less common, but possible).  \n   - `MANLY` is prioritized as a common word that tests **M** and **L**, two new unexplored letters.\n\n5. **Strategy**:  \n   - Guess `MANLY` to verify position 1 (M) and position 4 (L).  \n   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject M and L, narrowing options to `WANLY` or other candidates.\n\n<guess>manly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: manly -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).
- N is present but not in position 4 (guessed at position 4).

Guess 2: nasty -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- N is present but not at position 1 (guessed at position 1).
- A is correct at position 2.
- S and T are absent.
- Y is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: handy -> Feedback: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- H is absent.
- A is correct at position 2 (already known).
- N is correct at position 3 (new information).
- D is absent.
- Y is correct at position 5 (already known).

Guess 4: manly -> Feedback: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- M is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 2 (known).
- N is correct at position 3 (known).
- L is absent.
- Y is correct at position 5 (known).

Now, putting it all together:

- From Guess 4, we have M at position 1: ✓, so position 1 is M.
- Position 2: A (known from Guess 2).
- Position 3: N (known from Guess 3).
- Position 4: We don't know yet. But we know L is absent (from Guess 4).
- Position 5: Y (known from Guess 2).

Therefore, the secret word is M A N _ Y. We only need the fourth letter.

Also, we have many eliminated letters:

Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D, L (and more?).

From the feedback, absent letters are:
- Guess 1: C, R, E
- Guess 2: S, T
- Guess 3: H, D
- Guess 4: L

So total absent: C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.

We must also note that in Guess 1, we used A (which is present) and N (present). In Guess 2, we used N (present), A (present), S (absent), T (absent), Y (present). In Guess 3: H (absent), A (present), N (present), D (absent), Y (present). In Guess 4: M (present), A (present), N (present), L (absent), Y (present).

So we know the word: M A N [4] Y.

And we need to pick a letter for the fourth position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid English word.

Available letters: all letters except the absent ones: C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.

Also, we have already used: A, M, N, Y? But duplicates are possible? But we haven't seen evidence.

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY""? But L is absent? We tried ""manly"" and L was marked absent? And the fourth letter is L? So not?
- Then what? We need ""MAN_Y"" words.

Common options:
- ""MANKY""? Not globally recognized? 
- ""MANNY""? With two N's? But note: we have N at position 3? Then at position 4? We have ""MANNY"": M A N N Y? So double N? Then the fourth letter is N.

But is that allowed? We know the word has at least one N? But we got feedback that N was present? But we haven't guessed two N's? 

Consider: 
In Guess 1: crabby? crane had one N? So marked as absent for position 4? But the word has N at position 3? Then when we guessed position 4 for N? We got ""-""? Meaning yes the letter N is present but not at position 4? And now? If the word is ""manny""? Then we have N at position 3 and 4? 

When we guessed ""crane"" and put N at position 4? For ""manny""? The presence of N at position 3? The feedback? Should we have gotten a ""-"" for the N at position 4? Because N is present elsewhere? 

Similarly? When we guessed ""manly"" for ""manny""? Then position 4? We put L? Which is absent? So it was marked x? 

If we guess ""manny""? Then it has N at position 4? Which we know? We got feedback that N is not at position 4? So it shouldn't be? 

But wait: the feedback for Guess 1: N at position 4? Marked as ""-"". That means that N is present in the word but not at this position? And since the word must have at least one N? And it was not at position 4? 

But if the word has another N at position 3? That's fine? And we did confirm N at position 3? 

In ""manny""? N is at position 3 and 4? So the condition? We know N is at position 3? And position 4 is also N? So when we guessed position 4? We put N? Then that would be ✓? Because it is correct? But in Guess 1? We put N at position 4? And it was marked ""-""? Meaning? It is not correct for position 4? So the word does not have N at position 4? 

Therefore? ""manny"" would have N at position 4? So that would be incorrect? 

Thus? we cannot have a fourth letter N? 

Therefore? the fourth letter cannot be N? 

Also? we must pick a letter that hasn’t been eliminated? 

Therefore? we need to pick a letter not in C,D,E,H,L,R,S,T? 

And the word must be valid English? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY"": M A N K Y -> valid? Informal? Meaning: full of men? But also a Scottish term for scab? But we'll go by word list? 
- ""MANCY""? Not English? 
- ""MANWY""? No? 

Other ideas? 

What about ""MANAY""? No? 

Common? We have ""MANGY"": M A N G Y? But G is not eliminated? And ""mangy"" means scabby? 

Also? ""MANGY"" is a valid English word? 

And letters? M,A,N,G,Y? 

G? Not eliminated? 

So we can try ""MANGY""? 

Similarly? ""MANVY""? Not common? 

So ""MANGY""? 

Alternatively? ""MAN?Y"" words with one occurrence:? 

We also haven't tested G? 

Therefore? guess ""MANGY""? 

If we guess and get the feedback? Since we only have one unknown? 

But note? we already know M,A,N,Y? so the only feedback we will get for position 4 is whether G is correct or not? 

But we have two letters left? So if we guess wrong? We lose one more? 

But we have two tries left? 

Alternatively? we can list? 

The available letters for position 4 are all letters not eliminated and not used? 

Absent letters: C,D,E,H,L,R,S,T? 

So available? A,B,F,G,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But note? A,M,N,Y are already used? But duplicates? Are allowed? So duplicate A? For example? 

But the second letter is A? and we don't know if there are more? 

So for position 4? It could be A? 

Then ""MANAY""? Not English? 

Or ""MANSAY""? 5 letters? 

More common? 

Possible? 
- ""MANGA"": but ends with A? Not Y? 
- ""MANIY""? No? 
- ""MANOY""? Not English? 
- ""MANQY""? 

So perhaps only ""MANGY"" and ""MANKY"" are candidates? 

But ""MANKY"" is not globally recognized? So I prefer ""MANGY""? 

Therefore? guess ""MANGY""? 

And if not? then we try ""MANWY""? But let's not? 

So I say? ""MANGY"" 

But note? we must confirm: in Guess 1? we had A marked as present but not at position 3? and in the secret word? Position 3 is N? Position 2 is A? so A is at position 2? Which is fine? 

No conflict? 

So? 

Guess: ""MANGY""

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Previous Feedback Analysis:**
  - **Guess 1 (crane):**  
    - ✓: A and N are present → A not at position 3, N not at position 4.
    - ✗: C, R, E are absent.
  - **Guess 2 (nasty):**  
    - ✓: A (position 2) and Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: S, T are absent.  
    - ➖: N is present but not at position 1.  
  - **Guess 3 (handy):**  
    - ✓: A (position 2), N (position 3), Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: H, D are absent.  
  - **Guess 4 (manly):**  
    - ✓: M (position 1), A (position 2), N (position 3), Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: L is absent.

- **Deductions:**  
  - The secret word pattern is **M A N ? Y** (positions 1–3 and 5 confirmed: M, A, N, Y).  
  - Position 4 is the only unknown.  
  - **Eliminated letters (absent):** C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.  
  - **Available letters for position 4:** Letters not used/tested or confirmed absent: B, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - Possible English words fitting `M A N _ Y`:  
    - Common candidates: `MANGY` (scruffy), `MANKY` (slang; untidy), `MANWY` (not a valid word).  
    - `MANGY` is prioritized as a valid English word testing a new consonant (G) that may be correct.  
    - Other options like `MANWY` do not form valid words.  

- **Strategy:**  
  - With only position 4 unknown and limited guesses left, prioritize `MANGY` based on commonality.  
  - If incorrect, feedback for position 4 (G) will confirm/reject G and narrow options (e.g., `MANKY` if G is absent).

**Next guess:** `MANGY`  

<guess>mangy</guess>",mangy,"We are given feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are absent.
- A is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed at position 3).
- N is present but not in position 4 (guessed at position 4).

Guess 2: nasty -> Feedback: N(-) A(✓) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- N is present but not at position 1 (guessed at position 1).
- A is correct at position 2.
- S and T are absent.
- Y is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: handy -> Feedback: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- H is absent.
- A is correct at position 2 (already known).
- N is correct at position 3 (new information).
- D is absent.
- Y is correct at position 5 (already known).

Guess 4: manly -> Feedback: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
Meaning:
- M is correct at position 1.
- A is correct at position 2 (known).
- N is correct at position 3 (known).
- L is absent.
- Y is correct at position 5 (known).

Now, putting it all together:

- From Guess 4, we have M at position 1: ✓, so position 1 is M.
- Position 2: A (known from Guess 2).
- Position 3: N (known from Guess 3).
- Position 4: We don't know yet. But we know L is absent (from Guess 4).
- Position 5: Y (known from Guess 2).

Therefore, the secret word is M A N _ Y. We only need the fourth letter.

Also, we have many eliminated letters:

Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, H, D, L (and more?).

From the feedback, absent letters are:
- Guess 1: C, R, E
- Guess 2: S, T
- Guess 3: H, D
- Guess 4: L

So total absent: C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.

We must also note that in Guess 1, we used A (which is present) and N (present). In Guess 2, we used N (present), A (present), S (absent), T (absent), Y (present). In Guess 3: H (absent), A (present), N (present), D (absent), Y (present). In Guess 4: M (present), A (present), N (present), L (absent), Y (present).

So we know the word: M A N [4] Y.

And we need to pick a letter for the fourth position that is not in the absent list and that makes a valid English word.

Available letters: all letters except the absent ones: C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.

Also, we have already used: A, M, N, Y? But duplicates are possible? But we haven't seen evidence.

Possible words: 
- ""MANLY""? But L is absent? We tried ""manly"" and L was marked absent? And the fourth letter is L? So not?
- Then what? We need ""MAN_Y"" words.

Common options:
- ""MANKY""? Not globally recognized? 
- ""MANNY""? With two N's? But note: we have N at position 3? Then at position 4? We have ""MANNY"": M A N N Y? So double N? Then the fourth letter is N.

But is that allowed? We know the word has at least one N? But we got feedback that N was present? But we haven't guessed two N's? 

Consider: 
In Guess 1: crabby? crane had one N? So marked as absent for position 4? But the word has N at position 3? Then when we guessed position 4 for N? We got ""-""? Meaning yes the letter N is present but not at position 4? And now? If the word is ""manny""? Then we have N at position 3 and 4? 

When we guessed ""crane"" and put N at position 4? For ""manny""? The presence of N at position 3? The feedback? Should we have gotten a ""-"" for the N at position 4? Because N is present elsewhere? 

Similarly? When we guessed ""manly"" for ""manny""? Then position 4? We put L? Which is absent? So it was marked x? 

If we guess ""manny""? Then it has N at position 4? Which we know? We got feedback that N is not at position 4? So it shouldn't be? 

But wait: the feedback for Guess 1: N at position 4? Marked as ""-"". That means that N is present in the word but not at this position? And since the word must have at least one N? And it was not at position 4? 

But if the word has another N at position 3? That's fine? And we did confirm N at position 3? 

In ""manny""? N is at position 3 and 4? So the condition? We know N is at position 3? And position 4 is also N? So when we guessed position 4? We put N? Then that would be ✓? Because it is correct? But in Guess 1? We put N at position 4? And it was marked ""-""? Meaning? It is not correct for position 4? So the word does not have N at position 4? 

Therefore? ""manny"" would have N at position 4? So that would be incorrect? 

Thus? we cannot have a fourth letter N? 

Therefore? the fourth letter cannot be N? 

Also? we must pick a letter that hasn’t been eliminated? 

Therefore? we need to pick a letter not in C,D,E,H,L,R,S,T? 

And the word must be valid English? 

Possible words: 
- ""MANKY"": M A N K Y -> valid? Informal? Meaning: full of men? But also a Scottish term for scab? But we'll go by word list? 
- ""MANCY""? Not English? 
- ""MANWY""? No? 

Other ideas? 

What about ""MANAY""? No? 

Common? We have ""MANGY"": M A N G Y? But G is not eliminated? And ""mangy"" means scabby? 

Also? ""MANGY"" is a valid English word? 

And letters? M,A,N,G,Y? 

G? Not eliminated? 

So we can try ""MANGY""? 

Similarly? ""MANVY""? Not common? 

So ""MANGY""? 

Alternatively? ""MAN?Y"" words with one occurrence:? 

We also haven't tested G? 

Therefore? guess ""MANGY""? 

If we guess and get the feedback? Since we only have one unknown? 

But note? we already know M,A,N,Y? so the only feedback we will get for position 4 is whether G is correct or not? 

But we have two letters left? So if we guess wrong? We lose one more? 

But we have two tries left? 

Alternatively? we can list? 

The available letters for position 4 are all letters not eliminated and not used? 

Absent letters: C,D,E,H,L,R,S,T? 

So available? A,B,F,G,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

But note? A,M,N,Y are already used? But duplicates? Are allowed? So duplicate A? For example? 

But the second letter is A? and we don't know if there are more? 

So for position 4? It could be A? 

Then ""MANAY""? Not English? 

Or ""MANSAY""? 5 letters? 

More common? 

Possible? 
- ""MANGA"": but ends with A? Not Y? 
- ""MANIY""? No? 
- ""MANOY""? Not English? 
- ""MANQY""? 

So perhaps only ""MANGY"" and ""MANKY"" are candidates? 

But ""MANKY"" is not globally recognized? So I prefer ""MANGY""? 

Therefore? guess ""MANGY""? 

And if not? then we try ""MANWY""? But let's not? 

So I say? ""MANGY"" 

But note? we must confirm: in Guess 1? we had A marked as present but not at position 3? and in the secret word? Position 3 is N? Position 2 is A? so A is at position 2? Which is fine? 

No conflict? 

So? 

Guess: ""MANGY"" 

<guess>mangy</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Previous Feedback Analysis:**
  - **Guess 1 (crane):**  
    - ✓: A and N are present → A not at position 3, N not at position 4.
    - ✗: C, R, E are absent.
  - **Guess 2 (nasty):**  
    - ✓: A (position 2) and Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: S, T are absent.  
    - ➖: N is present but not at position 1.  
  - **Guess 3 (handy):**  
    - ✓: A (position 2), N (position 3), Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: H, D are absent.  
  - **Guess 4 (manly):**  
    - ✓: M (position 1), A (position 2), N (position 3), Y (position 5) are correct.  
    - ✗: L is absent.

- **Deductions:**  
  - The secret word pattern is **M A N ? Y** (positions 1–3 and 5 confirmed: M, A, N, Y).  
  - Position 4 is the only unknown.  
  - **Eliminated letters (absent):** C, D, E, H, L, R, S, T.  
  - **Available letters for position 4:** Letters not used/tested or confirmed absent: B, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - Possible English words fitting `M A N _ Y`:  
    - Common candidates: `MANGY` (scruffy), `MANKY` (slang; untidy), `MANWY` (not a valid word).  
    - `MANGY` is prioritized as a valid English word testing a new consonant (G) that may be correct.  
    - Other options like `MANWY` do not form valid words.  

- **Strategy:**  
  - With only position 4 unknown and limited guesses left, prioritize `MANGY` based on commonality.  
  - If incorrect, feedback for position 4 (G) will confirm/reject G and narrow options (e.g., `MANKY` if G is absent).

**Next guess:** `MANGY`",Guess 5: mangy -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(✓) G(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
