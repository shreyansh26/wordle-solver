We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (and not in the first because we know C is not the first and A was in the first in our guess? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in the third position, so it could be in the first? But wait, the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position: 1, 2, 4, or 5? However, note that we also have the information that C, R, N, E are absent. So the word must have A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.

But wait, we also know that R is absent? The feedback for R was 'x', meaning R is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain R.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words: besides A, we have S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have R, which is a very common letter.

Let's think of words that have A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to maximize information, we might prefer words with distinct letters.

Alternatively, let's try ""SLATE"", but we know E is not in the word (from feedback) and also T and L are common. But wait, E is out, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PLAIT"" (but has I and T, and A in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in a different position to test. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one A. However, for now, we assume we are testing one A.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and A at the end and in the middle? Let's break down:
P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. Also, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But to get more information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

So, let's try to find a word that has A and four new letters (not C, R, N, E) and distinct.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

One candidate: ""SPLIT"" -> but no A. We must include A.

Another: ""TAPAS"" -> duplicate A and S? Not distinct.

""ADIEU"" -> but E is out and U is less common? Also, E is not allowed.

We cannot use E.

Let me try ""AUDIO"" -> has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and avoids C, R, N, E. Also, A is in position 1.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not 5 distinct and has J which is uncommon.

""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> but N is out (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

""PAGOD"" -> not a common word? We need valid English words.

""ALOUD"" -> A, L, O, U, D. All distinct, avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 1.

""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.

We could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. It's a good candidate.

However, to maximize new letters, let's compare:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. 
Option 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).

But both are good.

We might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.

But we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.

So, we must include A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.

But the secret word might not have so many vowels. However, it's a good way to test multiple vowels.

Alternatively, ""ALOUD"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out and T is common. We cannot use N.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. Avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 2.

""MAILS"" is a valid word.

So, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.

So, second guess: ""AUDIO""

But let's write it in the required format.

We are to return: <guess>audio</guess>

But first, we must think step by step.

Step-by-step:
1. From first guess ""crane"": 
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.
3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:
   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).
   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
   - All letters are distinct.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.

So, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.
- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (and not in the first because we know C is not the first and A was in the first in our guess? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in the third position, so it could be in the first? But wait, the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position: 1, 2, 4, or 5? However, note that we also have the information that C, R, N, E are absent. So the word must have A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not 5 distinct and has J which is uncommon.

""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> but N is out (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

""PAGOD"" -> not a common word? We need valid English words.

""ALOUD"" -> A, L, O, U, D. All distinct, avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 1.

""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.

We could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. It's a good candidate.

However, to maximize new letters, let's compare:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. 
Option 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).

But both are good.

We might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.

But we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.

So, we must include A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.

But the secret word might not have so many vowels. However, it's a good way to test multiple vowels.

Alternatively, ""ALOUD"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out and T is common. We cannot use N.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. Avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 2.

""MAILS"" is a valid word.

So, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.

So, second guess: ""AUDIO""

But let's write it in the required format.

We are to return: <guess>audio</guess>

But first, we must think step by step.

Step-by-step:
1. From first guess ""crane"": 
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.
3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:
   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).
   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
   - All letters are distinct.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.

So, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.
- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:

Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven't tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

So the secret word must consist of:
- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)
- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We can list the available letters: 
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).
- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.

We have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.

Option 1: A in position 2.
Pattern: _ A _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it's okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.

But let's think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.

But wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.

But we don't know if the word has Y. So it's a good test.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Pattern: _ _ _ A _
Example: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let's see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.

To have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.

""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.

Option 3: A in position 5.
Pattern: _ _ _ _ A
Example: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.

""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But let's find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.

""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.

""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.

It's hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.

Another word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.

""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.

""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.

""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.

So, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it's tricky.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.

Given that, let's choose between:

Option A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""
Option B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""

But ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.

Now, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven't tested S, L, T, Y.

In ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven't tested S, P, L, T.

Both are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.

But we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it's correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.

But we don't have to get it correct; we just need feedback.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let's try 2 or 4.

But we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.

What about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.

""BALMY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.

""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.

I think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.

Similarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.

But in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.

We have to decide which position to test for A.

Since we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.

I think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let's pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it's there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.

But position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it's not, then A is likely in position 2.

Similarly, if we test position 2 and it's not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

But to be efficient, let's test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.

I'll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.

So, third guess: ""PALMS""

But let's confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Yes.

We could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.

So, <guess>palms</guess>

But we must think step by step.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).
- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".
- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.
- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.

If A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

So, the next guess is ""PALMS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").

### Key Deductions:
1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word. The secret word consists of A and four other letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Test A in a new position (position 2, since position 4 and 5 are less common and position 2 is a high-frequency spot for A).
   - Include other common, untested letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, M, P).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

### Why ""PALMS""?
- **A is in position 2**: This tests one of the possible positions for A (if A is correct here, we get a ""✓""; if not, it must be in position 4 or 5).
- **New letters tested**: P, L, M, S are high-frequency consonants not yet tested and not excluded.
- **Word validity**: ""PALMS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a type of tree or a symbol of victory).
- **Efficiency**: Tests multiple common letters at once, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

This guess will provide feedback on the position of A and the presence of P, L, M, S, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>palms</guess>",palms,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:

Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven't tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

So the secret word must consist of:
- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)
- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We can list the available letters: 
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).
- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.

We have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.

Option 1: A in position 2.
Pattern: _ A _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it's okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.

But let's think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.

But wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.

But we don't know if the word has Y. So it's a good test.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Pattern: _ _ _ A _
Example: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let's see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.

To have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.

""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.

Option 3: A in position 5.
Pattern: _ _ _ _ A
Example: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.

""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But let's find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.

""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.

""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.

It's hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.

Another word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.

""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.

""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.

""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.

So, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it's tricky.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.

Given that, let's choose between:

Option A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""
Option B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""

But ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.

Now, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven't tested S, L, T, Y.

In ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven't tested S, P, L, T.

Both are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.

But we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it's correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.

But we don't have to get it correct; we just need feedback.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let's try 2 or 4.

But we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.

What about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.

""BALMY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.

""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.

I think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.

Similarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.

But in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.

We have to decide which position to test for A.

Since we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.

I think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let's pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it's there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.

But position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it's not, then A is likely in position 2.

Similarly, if we test position 2 and it's not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

But to be efficient, let's test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.

I'll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.

So, third guess: ""PALMS""

But let's confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Yes.

We could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.

So, <guess>palms</guess>

But we must think step by step.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).
- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".
- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.
- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.

If A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

So, the next guess is ""PALMS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").

### Key Deductions:
1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word. The secret word consists of A and four other letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Test A in a new position (position 2, since position 4 and 5 are less common and position 2 is a high-frequency spot for A).
   - Include other common, untested letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, M, P).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

### Why ""PALMS""?
- **A is in position 2**: This tests one of the possible positions for A (if A is correct here, we get a ""✓""; if not, it must be in position 4 or 5).
- **New letters tested**: P, L, M, S are high-frequency consonants not yet tested and not excluded.
- **Word validity**: ""PALMS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a type of tree or a symbol of victory).
- **Efficiency**: Tests multiple common letters at once, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

This guess will provide feedback on the position of A and the presence of P, L, M, S, bringing us closer to the solution.",Guess 3: palms -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BAGGY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (and not in the first because we know C is not the first and A was in the first in our guess? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in the third position, so it could be in the first? But wait, the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position: 1, 2, 4, or 5? However, note that we also have the information that C, R, N, E are absent. So the word must have A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.

But wait, we also know that R is absent? The feedback for R was 'x', meaning R is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain R.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words: besides A, we have S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have R, which is a very common letter.

Let's think of words that have A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to maximize information, we might prefer words with distinct letters.

Alternatively, let's try ""SLATE"", but we know E is not in the word (from feedback) and also T and L are common. But wait, E is out, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PLAIT"" (but has I and T, and A in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in a different position to test. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one A. However, for now, we assume we are testing one A.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and A at the end and in the middle? Let's break down:
P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. Also, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But to get more information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

So, let's try to find a word that has A and four new letters (not C, R, N, E) and distinct.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

One candidate: ""SPLIT"" -> but no A. We must include A.

Another: ""TAPAS"" -> duplicate A and S? Not distinct.

""ADIEU"" -> but E is out and U is less common? Also, E is not allowed.

We cannot use E.

Let me try ""AUDIO"" -> has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and avoids C, R, N, E. Also, A is in position 1.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not 5 distinct and has J which is uncommon.

""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> but N is out (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

""PAGOD"" -> not a common word? We need valid English words.

""ALOUD"" -> A, L, O, U, D. All distinct, avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 1.

""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.

We could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. It's a good candidate.

However, to maximize new letters, let's compare:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. 
Option 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).

But both are good.

We might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.

But we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.

So, we must include A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.

But the secret word might not have so many vowels. However, it's a good way to test multiple vowels.

Alternatively, ""ALOUD"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out and T is common. We cannot use N.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. Avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 2.

""MAILS"" is a valid word.

So, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.

So, second guess: ""AUDIO""

But let's write it in the required format.

We are to return: <guess>audio</guess>

But first, we must think step by step.

Step-by-step:
1. From first guess ""crane"": 
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.
3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:
   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).
   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
   - All letters are distinct.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.

So, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.
- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:

Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven't tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

So the secret word must consist of:
- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)
- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We can list the available letters: 
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).
- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.

We have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.

Option 1: A in position 2.
Pattern: _ A _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it's okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.

But let's think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.

But wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.

But we don't know if the word has Y. So it's a good test.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Pattern: _ _ _ A _
Example: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let's see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.

To have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.

""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.

Option 3: A in position 5.
Pattern: _ _ _ _ A
Example: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.

""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But let's find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.

""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.

""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.

It's hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.

Another word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.

""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.

""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.

""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.

So, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it's tricky.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.

Given that, let's choose between:

Option A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""
Option B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""

But ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.

Now, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven't tested S, L, T, Y.

In ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven't tested S, P, L, T.

Both are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.

But we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it's correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.

But we don't have to get it correct; we just need feedback.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let's try 2 or 4.

But we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.

What about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.

""BALMY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.

""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.

I think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.

Similarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.

But in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.

We have to decide which position to test for A.

Since we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.

I think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let's pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it's there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.

But position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it's not, then A is likely in position 2.

Similarly, if we test position 2 and it's not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

But to be efficient, let's test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.

I'll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.

So, third guess: ""PALMS""

But let's confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Yes.

We could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.

So, <guess>palms</guess>

But we must think step by step.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).
- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".
- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.
- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.

If A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

So, the next guess is ""PALMS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").

### Key Deductions:
1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word. The secret word consists of A and four other letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Test A in a new position (position 2, since position 4 and 5 are less common and position 2 is a high-frequency spot for A).
   - Include other common, untested letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, M, P).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

### Why ""PALMS""?
- **A is in position 2**: This tests one of the possible positions for A (if A is correct here, we get a ""✓""; if not, it must be in position 4 or 5).
- **New letters tested**: P, L, M, S are high-frequency consonants not yet tested and not excluded.
- **Word validity**: ""PALMS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a type of tree or a symbol of victory).
- **Efficiency**: Tests multiple common letters at once, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

This guess will provide feedback on the position of A and the presence of P, L, M, S, bringing us closer to the solution.

Actually, in ""crane"", A was in the third position, so it could be in the first? But wait, the feedback for A is \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position: 1, 2, 4, or 5? However, note that we also have the information that C, R, N, E are absent. So the word must have A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n\nBut wait, we also know that R is absent? The feedback for R was \'x\', meaning R is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain R.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Includes the letter A (since we know it\'s in the word) and in a different position (not position 3).\n- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters in 5-letter words: besides A, we have S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe also note that the secret word does not have R, which is a very common letter.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nPossible positions for A:\n- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _\n- Position 2: _ A _ _ _\n- Position 4: _ _ _ A _\n- Position 5: _ _ _ _ A\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nA good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But to maximize information, we might prefer words with distinct letters.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s try ""SLATE"", but we know E is not in the word (from feedback) and also T and L are common. But wait, E is out, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".\n\nWe must avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nLet me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PLAIT"" (but has I and T, and A in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in a different position to test. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one A. However, for now, we assume we are testing one A.\n\nAnother idea: ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and A at the end and in the middle? Let\'s break down:\nP, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s. Also, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\nBut to get more information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.\n\nSo, let\'s try to find a word that has A and four new letters (not C, R, N, E) and distinct.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.\n\nOne candidate: ""SPLIT"" -> but no A. We must include A.\n\nAnother: ""TAPAS"" -> duplicate A and S? Not distinct.\n\n""ADIEU"" -> but E is out and U is less common? Also, E is not allowed.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nLet me try ""AUDIO"" -> has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and avoids C, R, N, E. Also, A is in position 1.\n\nBut is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nAlternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not 5 distinct and has J which is uncommon.\n\n""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> but N is out (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n""PAGOD"" -> not a common word? We need valid English words.\n\n""ALOUD"" -> A, L, O, U, D. All distinct, avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 1.\n\n""ALOUD"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.\n\nWe could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word. It\'s a good candidate.\n\nHowever, to maximize new letters, let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. \nOption 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).\n\nBut both are good.\n\nWe might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.\n\nBut we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.\n\nSo, we must include A.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.\n\nBut the secret word might not have so many vowels. However, it\'s a good way to test multiple vowels.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALOUD"" is similar.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out and T is common. We cannot use N.\n\n""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. Avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 2.\n\n""MAILS"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.\n\nSo, second guess: ""AUDIO""\n\nBut let\'s write it in the required format.\n\nWe are to return: <guess>audio</guess>\n\nBut first, we must think step by step.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. From first guess ""crane"": \n   - A is in the word but not in position 3.\n   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:\n   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).\n   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.\n   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n   - All letters are distinct.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.\n- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.\n- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""audio""\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:\n\nVowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven\'t tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.\n\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.\n\nSo the secret word must consist of:\n- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)\n- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe can list the available letters: \nB, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We should:\n- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).\n- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.\n\nWe have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.\n\nOption 1: A in position 2.\nPattern: _ A _ _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it\'s okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.\n\nBut let\'s think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.\n\nBut wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has Y. So it\'s a good test.\n\nOption 2: A in position 4.\nPattern: _ _ _ A _\nExample: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let\'s see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.\n\nTo have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.\n\n""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.\n\nOption 3: A in position 5.\nPattern: _ _ _ _ A\nExample: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.\n\n""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know. But let\'s find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.\n\n""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.\n\n""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.\n\nAnother word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.\n\n""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.\n\n""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.\n\n""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.\n\nSo, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it\'s tricky.\n\nPerhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose between:\n\nOption A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""\nOption B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""\n\nBut ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.\n\nNow, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven\'t tested S, L, T, Y.\n\nIn ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven\'t tested S, P, L, T.\n\nBoth are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it\'s correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.\n\nBut we don\'t have to get it correct; we just need feedback.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let\'s try 2 or 4.\n\nBut we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.\n\nI think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.\n\nWhat about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.\n\nSo we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nAnother word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.\n\n""BALMY"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.\n\n""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.\n\nI think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.\n\nBut in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.\n\nWe have to decide which position to test for A.\n\nSince we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.\n\nI think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let\'s pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it\'s there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nBut position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it\'s not, then A is likely in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we test position 2 and it\'s not, then A is in position 4 or 5.\n\nBut to be efficient, let\'s test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.\n\nSo, third guess: ""PALMS""\n\nBut let\'s confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.\n\nSo, <guess>palms</guess>\n\nBut we must think step by step.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).\n- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".\n- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.\n- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.\n\nIf A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""PALMS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").\n- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).\n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word.

We are given feedback for the third guess ""palms"":
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2)
- L: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this:
- A is confirmed to be in position 2 of the secret word.
- P, L, M, S are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

We also know that the secret word has A in the second position.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not in the excluded set.

Excluded set: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

Now, we know the word has A in position 2, and four other letters from the available set.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2 (since we know it's correct, we can keep it there to reduce possibilities).
- Uses four other letters from the available set to test for their presence.

But note: we don't have to put A in position 2 if we are sure, but since it's confirmed, we can fix it to reduce the search space.

So, the guess should have the form: _ A _ _ _

We need to choose the other four positions with available letters.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common available letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W.

We can try to form a word with distinct letters from these.

Possible words:

- ""BAGGY"" -> but has G twice and Y, and A in position 2? B-A-G-G-Y -> A in position 2, but duplicate G. Not ideal for information, but possible.

- ""BATTY"" -> B-A-T-T-Y -> duplicate T.

- ""HAPPY"" -> but P is excluded.

- ""TABBY"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> duplicate B.

- ""WACKY"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> but C is excluded.

C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

- ""WAGYU"" -> W-A-G-Y-U -> but U is excluded.

U is excluded.

- ""TAFFY"" -> T-A-F-F-Y -> duplicate F.

- ""GAWKY"" -> G-A-W-K-Y -> all distinct: G, A, W, K, Y. A in position 2.

Is ""GAWKY"" a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

- ""HASTY"" -> but S is excluded.

S is excluded.

- ""BALKY"" -> but L is excluded.

L is excluded.

- ""JAZZY"" -> J-A-Z-Z-Y -> duplicate Z, and Z is uncommon.

- ""KAYAK"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> duplicate K and A, but A is already known? We are putting A in position 2, but the word has another A? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But for guessing, we might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

""GAWKY"" seems good: G, A, W, K, Y. All distinct and available.

Another option: ""HAVOC"" -> but V, O, C: O and C are excluded.

""BAGEL"" -> E and L excluded.

""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O: U, M, O excluded.

""QUACK"" -> Q, U, A, C, K: U and C excluded, and A is in position 3? We need A in position 2.

So, ""GAWKY"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T-A-W-N-Y -> but N is excluded.

N is excluded.

""FAWNY"" -> F-A-W-N-Y -> N excluded.

""DAISY"" -> D and I and S excluded.

""GAMMY"" -> M excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" is one of the few options.

""HAKKY"" not a word.

""YACKY"" not a word.

""BAWDY"" -> B-A-W-D-Y -> but D is excluded.

D excluded.

""GAFFE"" -> E and F? But E excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" seems a good choice.

We could also consider ""TABLA"" but L excluded and A in position 2? T-A-B-L-A -> L excluded and duplicate A? But we don't know about duplicates.

But ""GAWKY"" tests G, W, K, Y, which are all new.

So, I'll go with ""GAWKY"".

Thus, fourth guess: ""GAWKY""

But let's write it.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)).
     - C, R, N, E are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 2 (""audio"")**:
     - A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)).
     - U, D, I, O are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 3 (""palms"")**:
     - A is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (A(✓)).
     - P, L, M, S are not in the word (all ""x"").

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **A is fixed in position 2**: The secret word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
   - **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S (12 letters total).
   - **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Strategy for the next guess**:
     - Must include A in position 2 (since it's confirmed correct).
     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool as possible to maximize information.
     - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, B, G, H, K, Y, W) to cover likely candidates.
     - Avoid duplicates if possible (since we have no evidence of repeated letters yet).

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Goal**: Form a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ A _ _ _` using only the remaining letters.
   - **Options considered**:
     - ""GAWKY"" (G, A, W, K, Y): Tests 4 new common letters (G, W, K, Y), all distinct. ""GAWKY"" is a valid English word (meaning awkward or clumsy).
     - Alternatives like ""BAGGY"" (duplicate G), ""TABBY"" (duplicate B), or ""WACKY"" (uses excluded C) were rejected for inefficiency or invalidity.
     - ""TAFFY"" (duplicate F) and ""HASTY"" (uses excluded S) are invalid due to exclusions or duplicates.
   - **Why ""GAWKY""?**:
     - Tests high-frequency consonants (G, K) and less common but possible letters (W, Y).
     - If any of G, W, K, Y are in the feedback, it will significantly narrow the solution. If all are ""x"", we can eliminate them and focus on other letters (e.g., B, H, T, F).

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Feedback on G, W, K, Y will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions (if present).
   - With A fixed in position 2, we can then focus on solving positions 1, 3, 4, 5 in subsequent guesses.

<guess>gawky</guess>",gawky,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""palms"":
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2)
- L: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this:
- A is confirmed to be in position 2 of the secret word.
- P, L, M, S are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

We also know that the secret word has A in the second position.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not in the excluded set.

Excluded set: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

Now, we know the word has A in position 2, and four other letters from the available set.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2 (since we know it's correct, we can keep it there to reduce possibilities).
- Uses four other letters from the available set to test for their presence.

But note: we don't have to put A in position 2 if we are sure, but since it's confirmed, we can fix it to reduce the search space.

So, the guess should have the form: _ A _ _ _

We need to choose the other four positions with available letters.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common available letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W.

We can try to form a word with distinct letters from these.

Possible words:

- ""BAGGY"" -> but has G twice and Y, and A in position 2? B-A-G-G-Y -> A in position 2, but duplicate G. Not ideal for information, but possible.

- ""BATTY"" -> B-A-T-T-Y -> duplicate T.

- ""HAPPY"" -> but P is excluded.

- ""TABBY"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> duplicate B.

- ""WACKY"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> but C is excluded.

C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

- ""WAGYU"" -> W-A-G-Y-U -> but U is excluded.

U is excluded.

- ""TAFFY"" -> T-A-F-F-Y -> duplicate F.

- ""GAWKY"" -> G-A-W-K-Y -> all distinct: G, A, W, K, Y. A in position 2.

Is ""GAWKY"" a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

- ""HASTY"" -> but S is excluded.

S is excluded.

- ""BALKY"" -> but L is excluded.

L is excluded.

- ""JAZZY"" -> J-A-Z-Z-Y -> duplicate Z, and Z is uncommon.

- ""KAYAK"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> duplicate K and A, but A is already known? We are putting A in position 2, but the word has another A? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But for guessing, we might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

""GAWKY"" seems good: G, A, W, K, Y. All distinct and available.

Another option: ""HAVOC"" -> but V, O, C: O and C are excluded.

""BAGEL"" -> E and L excluded.

""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O: U, M, O excluded.

""QUACK"" -> Q, U, A, C, K: U and C excluded, and A is in position 3? We need A in position 2.

So, ""GAWKY"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T-A-W-N-Y -> but N is excluded.

N is excluded.

""FAWNY"" -> F-A-W-N-Y -> N excluded.

""DAISY"" -> D and I and S excluded.

""GAMMY"" -> M excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" is one of the few options.

""HAKKY"" not a word.

""YACKY"" not a word.

""BAWDY"" -> B-A-W-D-Y -> but D is excluded.

D excluded.

""GAFFE"" -> E and F? But E excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" seems a good choice.

We could also consider ""TABLA"" but L excluded and A in position 2? T-A-B-L-A -> L excluded and duplicate A? But we don't know about duplicates.

But ""GAWKY"" tests G, W, K, Y, which are all new.

So, I'll go with ""GAWKY"".

Thus, fourth guess: ""GAWKY""

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,BAGGY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: x (not in the word)
A: - (in the word but wrong position)
N: x (not in the word)
E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position (and not in the first because we know C is not the first and A was in the first in our guess? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in the third position, so it could be in the first? But wait, the feedback for A is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the third position. It could be in any other position: 1, 2, 4, or 5? However, note that we also have the information that C, R, N, E are absent. So the word must have A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.

But wait, we also know that R is absent? The feedback for R was 'x', meaning R is not in the word. So the secret word does not contain R.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and in a different position (not position 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Tries to include other common letters to get more information.

Common letters in 5-letter words: besides A, we have S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have R, which is a very common letter.

Let's think of words that have A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: e.g., A _ _ _ _
- Position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ A _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ A

We should also try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But to maximize information, we might prefer words with distinct letters.

Alternatively, let's try ""SLATE"", but we know E is not in the word (from feedback) and also T and L are common. But wait, E is out, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

Let me think of words with A and without C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PLAIT"" (but has I and T, and A in position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for A? Actually, we can put A in a different position to test. But in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if the word has more than one A. However, for now, we assume we are testing one A.

Another idea: ""PASTA"" -> but has S, T, and A at the end and in the middle? Let's break down:
P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's. Also, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But to get more information, we might prefer a word with all distinct letters.

So, let's try to find a word that has A and four new letters (not C, R, N, E) and distinct.

Common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, etc.

One candidate: ""SPLIT"" -> but no A. We must include A.

Another: ""TAPAS"" -> duplicate A and S? Not distinct.

""ADIEU"" -> but E is out and U is less common? Also, E is not allowed.

We cannot use E.

Let me try ""AUDIO"" -> has A, U, D, I, O. All distinct and avoids C, R, N, E. Also, A is in position 1.

But is ""AUDIO"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Alternatively, ""OUIJA"" is not 5 distinct and has J which is uncommon.

""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O -> but N is out (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

""PAGOD"" -> not a common word? We need valid English words.

""ALOUD"" -> A, L, O, U, D. All distinct, avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 1.

""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.

We could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. It's a good candidate.

However, to maximize new letters, let's compare:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. 
Option 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).

But both are good.

We might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.

But we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.

So, we must include A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.

But the secret word might not have so many vowels. However, it's a good way to test multiple vowels.

Alternatively, ""ALOUD"" is similar.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" -> but N is out and T is common. We cannot use N.

""MAILS"" -> M, A, I, L, S. Avoids C, R, N, E. A is in position 2.

""MAILS"" is a valid word.

So, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.

I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.

So, second guess: ""AUDIO""

But let's write it in the required format.

We are to return: <guess>audio</guess>

But first, we must think step by step.

Step-by-step:
1. From first guess ""crane"": 
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.
2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.
3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:
   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).
   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.
   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).
   - All letters are distinct.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.

So, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.
- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.

We need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:

Vowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven't tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.

Consonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

So the secret word must consist of:
- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)
- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We can list the available letters: 
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should:
- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).
- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.

We have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.

Option 1: A in position 2.
Pattern: _ A _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it's okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.

But let's think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.

But wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.

But we don't know if the word has Y. So it's a good test.

Option 2: A in position 4.
Pattern: _ _ _ A _
Example: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let's see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.

To have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.

""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.

Option 3: A in position 5.
Pattern: _ _ _ _ A
Example: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.

""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But let's find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.

""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.

""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.

It's hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.

Another word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.

""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.

""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.

""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.

So, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it's tricky.

Perhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.

Given that, let's choose between:

Option A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""
Option B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""

But ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.

Now, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven't tested S, L, T, Y.

In ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven't tested S, P, L, T.

Both are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.

But we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it's correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.

But we don't have to get it correct; we just need feedback.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let's try 2 or 4.

But we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.

I think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.

What about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.

""BALMY"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.

""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.

I think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.

Similarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.

But in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.

We have to decide which position to test for A.

Since we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.

I think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let's pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it's there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.

But position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it's not, then A is likely in position 2.

Similarly, if we test position 2 and it's not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

But to be efficient, let's test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.

I'll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.

So, third guess: ""PALMS""

But let's confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

Yes.

We could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.

Therefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.

So, <guess>palms</guess>

But we must think step by step.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).
- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".
- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.
- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.

We hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.

If A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.

So, the next guess is ""PALMS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").

### Key Deductions:
1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word. The secret word consists of A and four other letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
3. **Strategy for the next guess**:
   - Test A in a new position (position 2, since position 4 and 5 are less common and position 2 is a high-frequency spot for A).
   - Include other common, untested letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, M, P).
   - Avoid all excluded letters.

### Why ""PALMS""?
- **A is in position 2**: This tests one of the possible positions for A (if A is correct here, we get a ""✓""; if not, it must be in position 4 or 5).
- **New letters tested**: P, L, M, S are high-frequency consonants not yet tested and not excluded.
- **Word validity**: ""PALMS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a type of tree or a symbol of victory).
- **Efficiency**: Tests multiple common letters at once, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

This guess will provide feedback on the position of A and the presence of P, L, M, S, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>palms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: palms -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""palms"":
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2)
- L: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from this:
- A is confirmed to be in position 2 of the secret word.
- P, L, M, S are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

We also know that the secret word has A in the second position.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not in the excluded set.

Excluded set: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

Now, we know the word has A in position 2, and four other letters from the available set.

We need to make a fourth guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2 (since we know it's correct, we can keep it there to reduce possibilities).
- Uses four other letters from the available set to test for their presence.

But note: we don't have to put A in position 2 if we are sure, but since it's confirmed, we can fix it to reduce the search space.

So, the guess should have the form: _ A _ _ _

We need to choose the other four positions with available letters.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common available letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W.

We can try to form a word with distinct letters from these.

Possible words:

- ""BAGGY"" -> but has G twice and Y, and A in position 2? B-A-G-G-Y -> A in position 2, but duplicate G. Not ideal for information, but possible.

- ""BATTY"" -> B-A-T-T-Y -> duplicate T.

- ""HAPPY"" -> but P is excluded.

- ""TABBY"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> duplicate B.

- ""WACKY"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> but C is excluded.

C is excluded, so we cannot use C.

- ""WAGYU"" -> W-A-G-Y-U -> but U is excluded.

U is excluded.

- ""TAFFY"" -> T-A-F-F-Y -> duplicate F.

- ""GAWKY"" -> G-A-W-K-Y -> all distinct: G, A, W, K, Y. A in position 2.

Is ""GAWKY"" a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

- ""HASTY"" -> but S is excluded.

S is excluded.

- ""BALKY"" -> but L is excluded.

L is excluded.

- ""JAZZY"" -> J-A-Z-Z-Y -> duplicate Z, and Z is uncommon.

- ""KAYAK"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> duplicate K and A, but A is already known? We are putting A in position 2, but the word has another A? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But for guessing, we might avoid duplicates to test more letters.

""GAWKY"" seems good: G, A, W, K, Y. All distinct and available.

Another option: ""HAVOC"" -> but V, O, C: O and C are excluded.

""BAGEL"" -> E and L excluded.

""JUMBO"" -> J, U, M, B, O: U, M, O excluded.

""QUACK"" -> Q, U, A, C, K: U and C excluded, and A is in position 3? We need A in position 2.

So, ""GAWKY"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""TAWNY"" -> T-A-W-N-Y -> but N is excluded.

N is excluded.

""FAWNY"" -> F-A-W-N-Y -> N excluded.

""DAISY"" -> D and I and S excluded.

""GAMMY"" -> M excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" is one of the few options.

""HAKKY"" not a word.

""YACKY"" not a word.

""BAWDY"" -> B-A-W-D-Y -> but D is excluded.

D excluded.

""GAFFE"" -> E and F? But E excluded.

So, ""GAWKY"" seems a good choice.

We could also consider ""TABLA"" but L excluded and A in position 2? T-A-B-L-A -> L excluded and duplicate A? But we don't know about duplicates.

But ""GAWKY"" tests G, W, K, Y, which are all new.

So, I'll go with ""GAWKY"".

Thus, fourth guess: ""GAWKY""

But let's write it.

<guess>gawky</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)).
     - C, R, N, E are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 2 (""audio"")**:
     - A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)).
     - U, D, I, O are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 3 (""palms"")**:
     - A is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (A(✓)).
     - P, L, M, S are not in the word (all ""x"").

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **A is fixed in position 2**: The secret word pattern is `_ A _ _ _`.
   - **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S (12 letters total).
   - **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Strategy for the next guess**:
     - Must include A in position 2 (since it's confirmed correct).
     - Test as many new, high-frequency letters from the remaining pool as possible to maximize information.
     - Prioritize common letters (e.g., T, B, G, H, K, Y, W) to cover likely candidates.
     - Avoid duplicates if possible (since we have no evidence of repeated letters yet).

3. **Selecting the Next Guess**:
   - **Goal**: Form a valid 5-letter word fitting `_ A _ _ _` using only the remaining letters.
   - **Options considered**:
     - ""GAWKY"" (G, A, W, K, Y): Tests 4 new common letters (G, W, K, Y), all distinct. ""GAWKY"" is a valid English word (meaning awkward or clumsy).
     - Alternatives like ""BAGGY"" (duplicate G), ""TABBY"" (duplicate B), or ""WACKY"" (uses excluded C) were rejected for inefficiency or invalidity.
     - ""TAFFY"" (duplicate F) and ""HASTY"" (uses excluded S) are invalid due to exclusions or duplicates.
   - **Why ""GAWKY""?**:
     - Tests high-frequency consonants (G, K) and less common but possible letters (W, Y).
     - If any of G, W, K, Y are in the feedback, it will significantly narrow the solution. If all are ""x"", we can eliminate them and focus on other letters (e.g., B, H, T, F).

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Feedback on G, W, K, Y will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions (if present).
   - With A fixed in position 2, we can then focus on solving positions 1, 3, 4, 5 in subsequent guesses.

So the secret word does not contain R.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess.

A is in position 1.\n\n""ALOUD"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""PLAID"" -> A is in position 3? We want to avoid position 3? Actually, we can try A in a different position to see if it is in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. But in ""ALOUD"", A is in position 1.\n\nWe could also try A in position 2: e.g., ""SALAD"" (but duplicate A) or ""SALTY"" (but has T and Y, and avoids C,R,N,E? Yes, but E is out). ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word. It\'s a good candidate.\n\nHowever, to maximize new letters, let\'s compare:\n\nOption 1: ""AUDIO"" -> letters: A, U, D, I, O. \nOption 2: ""ALOUD"" -> letters: A, L, O, U, D. (same as AUDIO but different order and L instead of I? Actually, AUDIO has I and no L, ALOUD has L and no I).\n\nBut both are good.\n\nWe might also consider ""STOMP"" but without A? We must include A to check its position? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know the position. So we should include A to get information about its position.\n\nBut we can also use a word without A? That would be inefficient because we know A is in the word. We should use A to get its correct position.\n\nSo, we must include A.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it has four vowels and D, which might help us narrow down the vowel positions.\n\nBut the secret word might not have so many vowels.

A is in position 2.\n\n""MAILS"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, we have several options: ""AUDIO"", ""ALOUD"", ""MAILS"", ""SALTY"", etc.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests four new vowels (A, U, I, O) and D, which is a common consonant.\n\nSo, second guess: ""AUDIO""\n\nBut let\'s write it in the required format.\n\nWe are to return: <guess>audio</guess>\n\nBut first, we must think step by step.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. From first guess ""crane"": \n   - A is in the word but not in position 3.\n   - C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n2. Therefore, the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n3. We choose ""AUDIO"" as the next guess because:\n   - It includes A (so we can get information about its position: we put it in position 1).\n   - It introduces four new common letters: U, D, I, O.\n   - It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E).\n   - All letters are distinct.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us which of these letters are in the word and in what positions.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (since it received ""-"").\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (since they received ""x"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.\n- To maximize new information, I chose a word with A in position 1 and four other common, distinct letters not yet tested: U, D, I, and O. This helps test multiple vowel/consonant possibilities efficiently.\n- ""AUDIO"" is a valid 5-letter English word that meets these criteria.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""audio""\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The letter A is in the secret word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback) and not in position 3 (from ""crane"" feedback). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\n2. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe now know the secret word contains A and four other letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O}. Also, A is in position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nWe need to think of common letters that are still possible. The remaining common consonants and vowels:\n\nVowels: We have tested A, E, I, O, U. Only A is in the word, and E, I, O, U are out. So the only vowel in the word is A? But that might not be the case because we haven\'t tested Y. Also, sometimes Y can act as a vowel.\n\nConsonants: We have tested C, R, N, D. The remaining common consonants include: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.\n\nSo the secret word must consist of:\n- One A (in position 2, 4, or 5)\n- Four other letters from the remaining alphabet excluding: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe can list the available letters: \nB, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, W, Y.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We should:\n- Include A in one of the positions 2, 4, or 5 (to test for its correct position).\n- Include other common letters from the available set to test for their presence.\n\nWe have to avoid the letters that are out: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2, 4, or 5 and use common letters.\n\nOption 1: A in position 2.\nPattern: _ A _ _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example, we can try ""SALTS"" but that has duplicate S? We want distinct letters if possible to maximize information. But the word might have duplicates, so it\'s okay, but for guessing, distinct letters are better.\n\nBut let\'s think: ""SALTY"" was a candidate earlier, but we know U, D, I, O are out, so ""SALTY"" has Y which is still available. However, in ""SALTY"", A is in position 2. But we also have to avoid E, which we are.\n\nBut wait, ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y. All these are available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has Y. So it\'s a good test.\n\nOption 2: A in position 4.\nPattern: _ _ _ A _\nExample: ""PLANT"" but N is out. Not allowed. ""BLAST"" has A in position 3? Let\'s see: B-L-A-S-T -> A is in position 3? We want position 4. So for position 4: e.g., ""FLAWS"" -> F-L-A-W-S? A is in position 3. Not 4.\n\nTo have A in position 4: e.g., ""STAMP"" -> S-T-A-M-P, A is in position 3. Not 4.\n\n""SPLAT"" -> S-P-L-A-T, A is in position 4. Yes. But we have to avoid R, N, E, U, D, I, O. ""SPLAT"" has S, P, L, A, T. All available.\n\nOption 3: A in position 5.\nPattern: _ _ _ _ A\nExample: ""PIZZA"" but Z is uncommon and I is out. Not allowed. ""AROMA"" has O and A twice? O is out. ""MANGA"" has N and A twice? N out.\n\n""TABLA"" -> T-A-B-L-A, A in position 2 and 5? But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know. But let\'s find a word with A only at the end. ""COBRA"" but C and O and R are out. Not allowed.\n\n""VISTA"" -> V-I-S-T-A, but I is out. ""JUMBA"" not a word? ""DELTA"" has E and D out. ""GAMMA"" has M twice and A twice? Not distinct.\n\n""KOALA"" has O and A twice? O out.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A only at the end without using forbidden letters. So maybe position 5 is less likely? But we should test.\n\nAnother word: ""SASSY"" but no A? ""CLASS"" has A? C-L-A-S-S, A in position 3. Not 5.\n\n""PAPAL"" has A in position 2 and 4? Not 5.\n\n""AVAIL"" has A in position 1 and 3? Not 5.\n\n""ALGAE"" has E and A in position 1 and 4? Not 5.\n\nSo, words with A in position 5 are less common. But they exist, e.g., ""PIZZA"" (but I and Z), ""JAZZY"", etc. But with forbidden letters, it\'s tricky.\n\nPerhaps we should focus on position 2 or 4 for A.\n\nGiven that, let\'s choose between:\n\nOption A: A in position 2, e.g., ""SALTY""\nOption B: A in position 4, e.g., ""SPLAT""\n\nBut ""SPLAT"" has A in position 4? S-P-L-A-T: positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:A, 5:T. Yes.\n\nNow, we also want to test other common letters. In ""SALTY"": letters S, A, L, T, Y. We haven\'t tested S, L, T, Y.\n\nIn ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T. We haven\'t tested S, P, L, T.\n\nBoth are good. But note that in ""SALTY"", we are testing Y, which is less common than P. So ""SPLAT"" might be better because P is more common.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we know A is not in position 1 or 3, so if we put A in position 2 and it gets a ✓, then we know it\'s correct. Similarly, if we put it in position 4 and it gets a ✓, we know.\n\nBut we don\'t have to get it correct; we just need feedback.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tested, which are 2,4,5. Since 5 is hard, let\'s try 2 or 4.\n\nBut we have two positions to test (2 and 4, and 5 is rare). We can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and also tests other common letters.\n\nI think ""SALTY"" is a good candidate because it tests S, A (in pos2), L, T, Y.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word that tests more common letters. Y is not as common as some others.\n\nWhat about ""STAMP""? But A is in position 3? We know A is not in position 3, so we cannot put it there. So ""STAMP"" would have A in the wrong position, but we already know that. But we want to test a new position for A.\n\nSo we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nAnother word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y. A in position 2. Letters: B, L, M, Y are available.\n\n""BALMY"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PALMS"" -> P, A, L, M, S. A in position 2.\n\n""PALMS"" has P, A, L, M, S. All common and available.\n\nI think ""PALMS"" is a good choice because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPLAT"" tests S, P, L, A (pos4), T.\n\nBut in ""SPLAT"", A is in position 4, which is a possibility.\n\nWe have to decide which position to test for A.\n\nSince we have two possibilities (2 and 4, and 5 is less likely), we can choose one arbitrarily or based on word frequency.\n\nI think position 2 is more common for A than position 4? Not necessarily, but let\'s pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 to see if it\'s there. If it is, we get a ✓, which is good. If not, then A must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nBut position 5 is rare, so if we test position 4 and it\'s not, then A is likely in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we test position 2 and it\'s not, then A is in position 4 or 5.\n\nBut to be efficient, let\'s test a word that has A in position 2 and also includes other common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PALMS"" because it tests P, A (pos2), L, M, S, which are all common and available.\n\nSo, third guess: ""PALMS""\n\nBut let\'s confirm: P, A, L, M, S. Avoids C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could also consider ""SLAMS"", but that has A in position 3? S-L-A-M-S -> A in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we must avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nTherefore, ""PALMS"" is good: P-A-L-M-S -> A in position 2.\n\nSo, <guess>palms</guess>\n\nBut we must think step by step.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- We know A is in the word and must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 3).\n- We choose to test A in position 2 with the word ""PALMS"".\n- This also tests the letters P, L, M, S, which are common and not yet tested.\n- We avoid all letters known to be absent: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O.\n\nWe hope to get feedback that tells us which of P, L, M, S are in the word and the position of A.\n\nIf A is in position 2, we might get a ✓ for A. If not, then A is in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""PALMS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)), and C, R, N, E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").\n- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)), and U, D, I, O are not in the word (all marked ""x"").\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **A must be in position 2, 4, or 5** of the secret word (since it cannot be in position 1 or 3).\n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O are not in the word. The secret word consists of A and four other letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n3. **Strategy for the next guess**:\n   - Test A in a new position (position 2, since position 4 and 5 are less common and position 2 is a high-frequency spot for A).\n   - Include other common, untested letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, L, M, P).\n   - Avoid all excluded letters.\n\n### Why ""PALMS""?\n- **A is in position 2**: This tests one of the possible positions for A (if A is correct here, we get a ""✓""; if not, it must be in position 4 or 5).\n- **New letters tested**: P, L, M, S are high-frequency consonants not yet tested and not excluded.\n- **Word validity**: ""PALMS"" is a valid 5-letter English word (meaning a type of tree or a symbol of victory).\n- **Efficiency**: Tests multiple common letters at once, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on the position of A and the presence of P, L, M, S, bringing us closer to the solution.\n\n<guess>palms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: palms -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""palms"":\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 2)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- M: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this:\n- A is confirmed to be in position 2 of the secret word.\n- P, L, M, S are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining with previous feedback:\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has A in the second position.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters that are not in the excluded set.\n\nExcluded set: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.\n\nNow, we know the word has A in position 2, and four other letters from the available set.\n\nWe need to make a fourth guess.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Has A in position 2 (since we know it\'s correct, we can keep it there to reduce possibilities).\n- Uses four other letters from the available set to test for their presence.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to put A in position 2 if we are sure, but since it\'s confirmed, we can fix it to reduce the search space.\n\nSo, the guess should have the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to choose the other four positions with available letters.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon available letters: T, B, G, H, K, Y, W.\n\nWe can try to form a word with distinct letters from these.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BAGGY"" -> but has G twice and Y, and A in position 2?

If all are ""x"", we can eliminate them and focus on other letters (e.g., B, H, T, F).\n\n4. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - Feedback on G, W, K, Y will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions (if present).\n   - With A fixed in position 2, we can then focus on solving positions 1, 3, 4, 5 in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>gawky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: palms -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) L(x) M(x) S(x)\nGuess 4: gawky -> FEEDBACK: G(-) A(✓) W(x) K(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""gawky"":
- G: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 2, which we already knew)
- W: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5)

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in position 5.
- G is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 and got '-').
- W and K are not in the word.

Now, we know the secret word has:
- A in position 2.
- Y in position 5.
- G is in the word, but not in position 1 (and not in position 2 or 5, obviously).

Also, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y

And G is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 5. So G must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, we have the list of excluded letters from previous guesses: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S, W, K.

And we have tested and found that G and Y are in the word (with Y fixed at position 5, and G in 3 or 4).

Now, the available letters for the remaining positions (1, 3, 4) are from the set of letters not excluded. But note that G is already in the word, so for the other two positions (besides the one G takes), we need two more letters.

The excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S, W, K.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z. But note that G is already in the word, so for the other positions, we can use any available letter, but we don't know if there are duplicates. However, since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we might assume no duplicates for now, but we have to be cautious.

But G is already in the word, so we don't need to test it again. We know it's present, but we need to find its position (3 or 4) and the other two letters.

The word structure: position 1, 3, 4 are to be filled, with:
- Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not G? but G is already used, and if no duplicates, then position 1 cannot be G. But we don't know for sure. However, since G is in the word and not in position 1, position 1 cannot be G anyway because we know G is not in position 1 from the feedback of ""gawky"". So position 1 is a new letter, not G and not excluded.

Similarly, position 3 and 4: one of them is G, and the other is a new letter.

So, the secret word has the form: [letter1] A [letter3 or G] [letter4 or G] Y

And we know that G is in either position 3 or 4.

Now, we need to make a fifth guess. We have two main objectives:
1. Determine the position of G (is it in 3 or 4?).
2. Find the other two letters (for position 1 and the remaining position between 3 and 4).

We should choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2 and Y in position 5 (since we know they are fixed).
- Tests G in one of the positions 3 or 4 (to see if it gets a ✓ or -).
- Tests new letters for the other positions.

But note: we can only test one position for G at a time.

Option: put G in position 3 and a new letter in position 4, and a new letter in position 1.

Or put G in position 4 and new letters in 1 and 3.

We also need to use available letters: B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z (and G, but we are using it).

Common letters from available: T, B, H, F are more common than others.

Let's try to form words.

First, if we put G in position 3: pattern: _ A G _ Y

Then we need to fill position 1 and 4 with available letters.

Possible words: 
- ""BAGGY"" -> but has two G's? B-A-G-G-Y -> but we have G in position 3 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have Y at the end. But ""BAGGY"" has Y in position 5, which is good, but position 4 is G. However, we are testing G in position 3. But if we use ""BAGGY"", then position 3 is G and position 4 is G, which would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has duplicate G. Also, we have B in position 1.

But in ""BAGGY"", the feedback might be confusing. Also, we are testing B and duplicate G.

Alternatively, without duplicate: ""TANGY"" -> but N is excluded. Not allowed.

""HAGGY"" -> duplicate G and H? H-A-G-G-Y.

""JAGGY"" -> J-A-G-G-Y, duplicate G.

It's hard to find a word with _ A G _ Y without duplicate G or using excluded letters.

What about ""MAGGY""? M is excluded.

""RAGGY""? R excluded.

So, perhaps no common word with _ A G _ Y and distinct letters.

Now, try putting G in position 4: pattern: _ A _ G Y

Then we need to fill position 1 and 3.

Possible words:
- ""BAGGY"" -> but again, duplicate G? B-A-G-G-Y -> position 3 is G and position 4 is G? So same issue.

But let's think of words without duplicate G.

For example: ""TAGGY"" -> duplicate G.

""NAGGY"" -> N excluded.

""FAGGY"" -> F-A-G-G-Y, duplicate G.

""WAGGY"" -> W excluded.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps the word has duplicate G? But we haven't encountered duplicates so far, but it's possible.

Another idea: maybe G is in position 3 and position 4 is a different letter.

But what words are there? Let me think.

""BAGGY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but duplicate.

""HAZY"" is 4 letters.

""PAGED"" but E and D excluded.

""RAGED"" excluded.

""NAGOR"" not a word.

Perhaps ""TAGUA"" -> T-A-G-U-A, but U and A duplicate? U excluded.

Not working.

Maybe we should consider that G might not be in position 3 or 4? But the feedback says G is in the word but not in position 1, and positions 2 and 5 are taken by A and Y, so it must be in 3 or 4.

So, we have to deal with it.

Another word: ""CAGED"" excluded.

""JAGER"" excluded.

Perhaps ""TAIGA"" -> T-A-I-G-A, but I excluded and duplicate A? I is excluded.

""MANGA"" excluded.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ Y and contain G and one more letter from available, and the known exclusions.

The word must have: A in 2, Y in 5, G in 3 or 4, and two other letters (which could be the same?).

But the two other letters are for position 1 and either 3 or 4 (whichever G is not in).

And the available letters for those are: B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Now, common combinations:

If G is in position 3: word is [1] A G [4] Y

[1] and [4] are from available letters.

Possible words:
- ""HAGGY"" -> H and G, but [4] is G, so duplicate G. But is it valid? H-A-G-G-Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, H is available.

Similarly, ""BAGGY"", ""FAGGY"", ""JAGGY"", ""TAGGY"", ""VAGGY"" (not a word?), ""ZAGGY"" (not a word).

""BAGGY"" is a word (baggy clothes).

Similarly, ""TAGGY"" might not be standard.

If G is in position 4: word is [1] A [3] G Y

Then [1] and [3] from available.

Words: 
- ""BAGGY"" -> B-A-G-G-Y, so [3] is G, which would be duplicate if G is in position 4? In this case, if G is in position 4, then position 3 is G? That would be duplicate.

But ""BAGGY"" has G in position 3 and 4.

Other words: ""TANGY"" -> T-A-N-G-Y, but N excluded.

""HANKY"" -> N and K excluded.

""JAZZY"" -> J-A-Z-Z-Y, no G.

""FAKY"" not 5 letters.

""TAFFY"" -> T-A-F-F-Y, no G, and duplicate F.

But we need G in position 4.

So for G in position 4: ""BAGGY"" is the only common word, but it has G in both 3 and 4.

Perhaps the secret word is ""BAGGY""?

But let's see if it fits all feedback.

Secret word ""BAGGY"":
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(not in), R(not in), A(in but wrong position: in crane it's pos3, in baggy it's pos2, so should be '-'), N(not in), E(not in) -> matches feedback: A(-), others x.
- Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(in but wrong position: in audio pos1, in baggy pos2, so '-'), U(not in), D(not in), I(not in), O(not in) -> matches.
- Guess 3: ""palms"" -> P(not in), A(in and correct position, so '✓'), L(not in), M(not in), S(not in) -> matches: A(✓), others x.
- Guess 4: ""gawky"" -> G(in but wrong position: in gawky pos1, in baggy pos3, so '-'), A(✓), W(not in), K(not in), Y(in and correct position, so '✓') -> matches: G(-), A(✓), W(x), K(x), Y(✓).

So ""BAGGY"" fits all feedback.

But is ""BAGGY"" a valid word? Yes.

And it has duplicate G, which we didn't assume, but it works.

But in our fourth guess, we got Y(✓) and G(-), which is consistent with ""BAGGY"" having Y in position 5 and G in position 3 (not position 1).

So, the secret word is likely ""BAGGY"".

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only two tries left, we can guess ""BAGGY"".

But let's confirm if there are other possibilities.

Are there other words that fit?

For example, if G is in position 4, what words are there?

Suppose G in position 4: _ A _ G Y

Then the third position must be a letter that can be before G and form a word.

With available letters: [1] and [3] from B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Words: 
- ""TANGY"" -> but N excluded.
- ""BAGGY"" -> but that has G in position 3 and 4, so if we consider G in position 4, then position 3 is also G, so it's the same.
- ""HAGGY"" -> H-A-G-G-Y, same as above.
- ""JAGGY"" -> J-A-G-G-Y.
- ""FAGGY"" -> F-A-G-G-Y.

All these have duplicate G.

Is there a word without duplicate? For example, ""TAIGA"" is not, and has I.

""VAGUY"" not a word.

So, essentially, the only possibilities are words like ""BAGGY"", ""HAGGY"", ""JAGGY"", ""FAGGY"", ""TAGGY"", etc., all with duplicate G.

But ""TAGGY"" might not be a standard word. Let's check: ""Taggy"" is not commonly a word, but ""Baggy"" is common.

Similarly, ""Haggy"" is less common, meaning of or like a hag.

""Faggy"" might be offensive.

""Jaggy"" is a word, meaning jagged or having jags.

But ""Baggy"" is the most common.

In the context of Wordle, we should use common words.

But we have to guess one.

Since ""BAGGY"" fits and is common, we can guess that.

But note: in our available letters, we have B, F, H, J, etc., so multiple possibilities.

But we can test with a guess that distinguishes them.

For example, we can guess a word that has B in position 1 to see if it's B.

But we have only two guesses left (this is the fifth, and we have one more after if needed).

But if we guess ""BAGGY"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it's not B, and we can try another.

But if we guess ""BAGGY"" and it's wrong, we lose a guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to the whole word.

For example, we can form a word that has A in 2, Y in 5, G in position 3 (or 4), and then use two different letters for the other positions to test.

But we don't know the position of G.

Let's try to test for position of G and the first letter simultaneously.

For example, if we put G in position 3, then the word is [1] A G [4] Y

We can choose [1] and [4] from available letters, but we need a valid word.

Similarly, if we put G in position 4, [1] A [3] G Y.

But we have to choose one.

Since we suspect duplicate G, we can try ""BAGGY"" directly.

But to be safe, we can try a word that doesn't assume duplicate, but we couldn't find one.

Another possibility: maybe the word is ""TAWPY"" or something, but W is excluded and no G.

Or ""GASSY"" but S excluded.

I think ""BAGGY"" is the most likely.

Perhaps ""HAYEY"" but E excluded and no G.

So, I think we should guess ""BAGGY"".

But let's see the feedback we have: in guess 4, we have G(-) meaning G is not in position 1, and Y(✓) in position 5.

In ""BAGGY"", G is in position 3, so it should have been marked as present but not in position 1, which matches.

And the word has A in 2, Y in 5.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Thus, fifth guess: ""BAGGY""

But in the response, we need to output the guess.

<guess>baggy</guess>

But note: if it's not ""BAGGY"", we have one more guess, but we'll see.

Alternatively, we could guess a word like ""BATTY"" but T is available, but no G, and we know G is in the word, so we must include G.

We must include G because it's in the word.

So, any guess must include G, A, and Y, with A in 2, Y in 5, and G in 3 or 4.

And the other letters from available.

So, ""BAGGY"" is a valid attempt.

So, I'll go with that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - A is in the word but not in position 3 (A(-)).
     - C, R, N, E are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 2 (""audio"")**:
     - A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)).
     - U, D, I, O are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 3 (""palms"")**:
     - A is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (A(✓)).
     - P, L, M, S are not in the word (all ""x"").
   - **Guess 4 (""gawky"")**:
     - G is in the word but not in position 1 (G(-)).
     - A is confirmed in position 2 (A(✓)).
     - W and K are not in the word (both ""x"").
     - Y is in the word and **correctly placed in position 5** (Y(✓)).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed positions**:
     - Position 2: A (confirmed ✓ from Guess 3).
     - Position 5: Y (confirmed ✓ from Guess 4).
   - **G is in the word but position unknown**: 
     - From ""gawky"" feedback, G is not in position 1 (G(-)). Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed (A and Y), G must be in position 3 or 4.
   - **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S, W, K (14 letters total).
   - **Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, and 4**: B, F, G, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z.
     - G is already confirmed in the word (so it occupies one of positions 3 or 4), leaving two positions (1 and either 3 or 4) to be filled with the remaining letters.
   - **Word pattern**: `_ A _ _ Y` with G in position 3 or 4.

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Must include A in position 2 and Y in position 5** (fixed).
   - **Must include G** (confirmed present) in either position 3 or 4 to test its exact location.
   - **Test high-frequency remaining letters** (e.g., B, F, H, T) for positions 1 and the open slot (3 or 4).
   - **Prioritize common words**: Given the constraints, the only common English words fitting the pattern `_ A _ _ Y` with G in position 3 or 4 are those with a double-G (e.g., ""BAGGY"", ""HAGGY"", ""JAGGY""). ""BAGGY"" is the most common and efficient guess:
     - It tests G in position 3 (helping confirm if G is here or must be in position 4).
     - It tests B in position 1 (a high-frequency consonant).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on B and G's position will narrow options to rarer words like ""HAGGY"" or ""JAGGY"" for the final guess.

4. **Why ""BAGGY""?**:
   - **Fits all constraints**: 
     - Position 1: B (untested letter).
     - Position 2: A (fixed).
     - Position 3: G (tests if G is here).
     - Position 4: G (if G is actually here, it may appear as a duplicate; if not, feedback will show if G is in position 4).
     - Position 5: Y (fixed).
   - **Efficiency**: Tests B and the position of G simultaneously. If G is in position 3, it may get a ✓; if in position 4, it may get a - (wrong position). If B is absent, it gets an ""x"".
   - **Validity**: ""BAGGY"" is a common English word (meaning loose-fitting or puffy).

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - **If ""BAGGY"" is correct**: Puzzle solved.
   - **If incorrect**: Feedback will:
     - Confirm if G is in position 3 (✓), position 4 (-), or neither (x, but unlikely as G is confirmed present).
     - Reveal if B is in the word and its position.
     - Allow us to use the final guess for alternatives (e.g., ""HAGGY"" if B is absent).

Given the above, ""BAGGY"" is the optimal guess for this step.

<guess>baggy</guess>",baggy,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""gawky"":
- G: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in position 2, which we already knew)
- W: x (not in the word)
- K: x (not in the word)
- Y: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5)

So, from this:
- Y is in the word and in position 5.
- G is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 and got '-').
- W and K are not in the word.

Now, we know the secret word has:
- A in position 2.
- Y in position 5.
- G is in the word, but not in position 1 (and not in position 2 or 5, obviously).

Also, the word pattern is: _ A _ _ Y

And G is somewhere in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 5. So G must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, we have the list of excluded letters from previous guesses: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S, W, K.

And we have tested and found that G and Y are in the word (with Y fixed at position 5, and G in 3 or 4).

Now, the available letters for the remaining positions (1, 3, 4) are from the set of letters not excluded. But note that G is already in the word, so for the other two positions (besides the one G takes), we need two more letters.

The excluded letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, P, L, M, S, W, K.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z. But note that G is already in the word, so for the other positions, we can use any available letter, but we don't know if there are duplicates. However, since we haven't encountered duplicates yet, we might assume no duplicates for now, but we have to be cautious.

But G is already in the word, so we don't need to test it again. We know it's present, but we need to find its position (3 or 4) and the other two letters.

The word structure: position 1, 3, 4 are to be filled, with:
- Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not excluded and not G? but G is already used, and if no duplicates, then position 1 cannot be G. But we don't know for sure. However, since G is in the word and not in position 1, position 1 cannot be G anyway because we know G is not in position 1 from the feedback of ""gawky"". So position 1 is a new letter, not G and not excluded.

Similarly, position 3 and 4: one of them is G, and the other is a new letter.

So, the secret word has the form: [letter1] A [letter3 or G] [letter4 or G] Y

And we know that G is in either position 3 or 4.

Now, we need to make a fifth guess. We have two main objectives:
1. Determine the position of G (is it in 3 or 4?).
2. Find the other two letters (for position 1 and the remaining position between 3 and 4).

We should choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2 and Y in position 5 (since we know they are fixed).
- Tests G in one of the positions 3 or 4 (to see if it gets a ✓ or -).
- Tests new letters for the other positions.

But note: we can only test one position for G at a time.

Option: put G in position 3 and a new letter in position 4, and a new letter in position 1.

Or put G in position 4 and new letters in 1 and 3.

We also need to use available letters: B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z (and G, but we are using it).

Common letters from available: T, B, H, F are more common than others.

Let's try to form words.

First, if we put G in position 3: pattern: _ A G _ Y

Then we need to fill position 1 and 4 with available letters.

Possible words: 
- ""BAGGY"" -> but has two G's? B-A-G-G-Y -> but we have G in position 3 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have Y at the end. But ""BAGGY"" has Y in position 5, which is good, but position 4 is G. However, we are testing G in position 3. But if we use ""BAGGY"", then position 3 is G and position 4 is G, which would be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has duplicate G. Also, we have B in position 1.

But in ""BAGGY"", the feedback might be confusing. Also, we are testing B and duplicate G.

Alternatively, without duplicate: ""TANGY"" -> but N is excluded. Not allowed.

""HAGGY"" -> duplicate G and H? H-A-G-G-Y.

""JAGGY"" -> J-A-G-G-Y, duplicate G.

It's hard to find a word with _ A G _ Y without duplicate G or using excluded letters.

What about ""MAGGY""? M is excluded.

""RAGGY""? R excluded.

So, perhaps no common word with _ A G _ Y and distinct letters.

Now, try putting G in position 4: pattern: _ A _ G Y

Then we need to fill position 1 and 3.

Possible words:
- ""BAGGY"" -> but again, duplicate G? B-A-G-G-Y -> position 3 is G and position 4 is G? So same issue.

But let's think of words without duplicate G.

For example: ""TAGGY"" -> duplicate G.

""NAGGY"" -> N excluded.

""FAGGY"" -> F-A-G-G-Y, duplicate G.

""WAGGY"" -> W excluded.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps the word has duplicate G? But we haven't encountered duplicates so far, but it's possible.

Another idea: maybe G is in position 3 and position 4 is a different letter.

But what words are there? Let me think.

""BAGGY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but duplicate.

""HAZY"" is 4 letters.

""PAGED"" but E and D excluded.

""RAGED"" excluded.

""NAGOR"" not a word.

Perhaps ""TAGUA"" -> T-A-G-U-A, but U and A duplicate? U excluded.

Not working.

Maybe we should consider that G might not be in position 3 or 4? But the feedback says G is in the word but not in position 1, and positions 2 and 5 are taken by A and Y, so it must be in 3 or 4.

So, we have to deal with it.

Another word: ""CAGED"" excluded.

""JAGER"" excluded.

Perhaps ""TAIGA"" -> T-A-I-G-A, but I excluded and duplicate A? I is excluded.

""MANGA"" excluded.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ Y and contain G and one more letter from available, and the known exclusions.

The word must have: A in 2, Y in 5, G in 3 or 4, and two other letters (which could be the same?).

But the two other letters are for position 1 and either 3 or 4 (whichever G is not in).

And the available letters for those are: B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Now, common combinations:

If G is in position 3: word is [1] A G [4] Y

[1] and [4] are from available letters.

Possible words:
- ""HAGGY"" -> H and G, but [4] is G, so duplicate G. But is it valid? H-A-G-G-Y. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, H is available.

Similarly, ""BAGGY"", ""FAGGY"", ""JAGGY"", ""TAGGY"", ""VAGGY"" (not a word?), ""ZAGGY"" (not a word).

""BAGGY"" is a word (baggy clothes).

Similarly, ""TAGGY"" might not be standard.

If G is in position 4: word is [1] A [3] G Y

Then [1] and [3] from available.

Words: 
- ""BAGGY"" -> B-A-G-G-Y, so [3] is G, which would be duplicate if G is in position 4? In this case, if G is in position 4, then position 3 is G? That would be duplicate.

But ""BAGGY"" has G in position 3 and 4.

Other words: ""TANGY"" -> T-A-N-G-Y, but N excluded.

""HANKY"" -> N and K excluded.

""JAZZY"" -> J-A-Z-Z-Y, no G.

""FAKY"" not 5 letters.

""TAFFY"" -> T-A-F-F-Y, no G, and duplicate F.

But we need G in position 4.

So for G in position 4: ""BAGGY"" is the only common word, but it has G in both 3 and 4.

Perhaps the secret word is ""BAGGY""?

But let's see if it fits all feedback.

Secret word ""BAGGY"":
- Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(not in), R(not in), A(in but wrong position: in crane it's pos3, in baggy it's pos2, so should be '-'), N(not in), E(not in) -> matches feedback: A(-), others x.
- Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(in but wrong position: in audio pos1, in baggy pos2, so '-'), U(not in), D(not in), I(not in), O(not in) -> matches.
- Guess 3: ""palms"" -> P(not in), A(in and correct position, so '✓'), L(not in), M(not in), S(not in) -> matches: A(✓), others x.
- Guess 4: ""gawky"" -> G(in but wrong position: in gawky pos1, in baggy pos3, so '-'), A(✓), W(not in), K(not in), Y(in and correct position, so '✓') -> matches: G(-), A(✓), W(x), K(x), Y(✓).

So ""BAGGY"" fits all feedback.

But is ""BAGGY"" a valid word? Yes.

And it has duplicate G, which we didn't assume, but it works.

But in our fourth guess, we got Y(✓) and G(-), which is consistent with ""BAGGY"" having Y in position 5 and G in position 3 (not position 1).

So, the secret word is likely ""BAGGY"".

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only two tries left, we can guess ""BAGGY"".

But let's confirm if there are other possibilities.

Are there other words that fit?

For example, if G is in position 4, what words are there?

Suppose G in position 4: _ A _ G Y

Then the third position must be a letter that can be before G and form a word.

With available letters: [1] and [3] from B, F, H, J, Q, T, V, X, Z.

Words: 
- ""TANGY"" -> but N excluded.
- ""BAGGY"" -> but that has G in position 3 and 4, so if we consider G in position 4, then position 3 is also G, so it's the same.
- ""HAGGY"" -> H-A-G-G-Y, same as above.
- ""JAGGY"" -> J-A-G-G-Y.
- ""FAGGY"" -> F-A-G-G-Y.

All these have duplicate G.

Is there a word without duplicate? For example, ""TAIGA"" is not, and has I.

""VAGUY"" not a word.

So, essentially, the only possibilities are words like ""BAGGY"", ""HAGGY"", ""JAGGY"", ""FAGGY"", ""TAGGY"", etc., all with duplicate G.

But ""TAGGY"" might not be a standard word. Let's check: ""Taggy"" is not commonly a word, but ""Baggy"" is common.

Similarly, ""Haggy"" is less common, meaning of or like a hag.

""Faggy"" might be offensive.

""Jaggy"" is a word, meaning jagged or having jags.

But ""Baggy"" is the most common.

In the context of Wordle, we should use common words.

But we have to guess one.

Since ""BAGGY"" fits and is common, we can guess that.

But note: in our available letters, we have B, F, H, J, etc., so multiple possibilities.

But we can test with a guess that distinguishes them.

For example, we can guess a word that has B in position 1 to see if it's B.

But we have only two guesses left (this is the fifth, and we have one more after if needed).

But if we guess ""BAGGY"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it's not B, and we can try another.

But if we guess ""BAGGY"" and it's wrong, we lose a guess.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests the first letter without committing to the whole word.

For example, we can form a word that has A in 2, Y in 5, G in position 3 (or 4), and then use two different letters for the other positions to test.

But we don't know the position of G.

Let's try to test for position of G and the first letter simultaneously.

For example, if we put G in position 3, then the word is [1] A G [4] Y

We can choose [1] and [4] from available letters, but we need a valid word.

Similarly, if we put G in position 4, [1] A [3] G Y.

But we have to choose one.

Since we suspect duplicate G, we can try ""BAGGY"" directly.

But to be safe, we can try a word that doesn't assume duplicate, but we couldn't find one.

Another possibility: maybe the word is ""TAWPY"" or something, but W is excluded and no G.

Or ""GASSY"" but S excluded.

I think ""BAGGY"" is the most likely.

Perhaps ""HAYEY"" but E excluded and no G.

So, I think we should guess ""BAGGY"".

But let's see the feedback we have: in guess 4, we have G(-) meaning G is not in position 1, and Y(✓) in position 5.

In ""BAGGY"", G is in position 3, so it should have been marked as present but not in position 1, which matches.

And the word has A in 2, Y in 5.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Thus, fifth guess: ""BAGGY""

But in the response, we need to output the guess.

<guess>baggy</guess>

But note: if it's not ""BAGGY"", we have one more guess, but we'll see.

Alternatively, we could guess a word like ""BATTY"" but T is available, but no G, and we know G is in the word, so we must include G.

We must include G because it's in the word.

So, any guess must include G, A, and Y, with A in 2, Y in 5, and G in 3 or 4.

And the other letters from available.

So, ""BAGGY"" is a valid attempt.

So, I'll go with that.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
