We are making the first guess. There's no feedback from previous guesses. We should choose a word that maximizes the information gained, meaning it includes common letters and a variety of distinct letters.

Common English letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A good starting word often has 5 distinct letters and includes vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words are:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRATE
- ROAST
- SALET
- etc.

I will choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants. Let me use ""CRANE"".

It has:
- C, R, A, N, E

This covers common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

So my first guess: CRANE

But note: our goal is to represent thinking step by step and then output the guess.

Let me output accordingly.

For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter English word that maximizes information gain. An effective starting word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and have minimal repeats. 

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, allowing feedback to cover five different characters.
- The combination tests positions for multiple high-frequency letters, which can quickly reveal matches or eliminate possibilities.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(-)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""crane"").
 - A is not in the secret word.
 - N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""crane"").
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, and E, but not C or A.
 - R is not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we should try to use a word that includes these and also tests new letters.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain C or A, so we avoid those.

 Let's think of a new word that:
 1. Includes R, N, E (since we know they are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions to find their correct spots).
 2. Avoids C and A.
 3. Uses new letters to test.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 The feedback for R, N, E is that they are present but in the wrong positions. So we should try to put them in positions that are not ruled out.

 Positions ruled out:
 - R cannot be in position 2.
 - N cannot be in position 4.
 - E cannot be in position 5.

 We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5; E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we know the word has 5 letters, so we need to fill the other two letters with new ones.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the letters we already know (R, N, E) in the same positions? Actually, we can try R in a new position, but we don't want to put R in position 2 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N and E.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to test two new letters.

 We can try to form a word that has R, N, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if there are duplicates. Also, we have E in two positions, but we know E is in the word but not at the end. Also, we have W as a new letter. However, we have R in position 1, E in 2, N in 3, E in 4, W in 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so W at 5 is okay. But we are using E twice? We don't know if the word has two E's. It's possible, but we have limited information. Also, we have R in position 1 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (which is allowed). But we are using E in position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are possible. However, we don't want to use the same letter twice if we can avoid it to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating letters.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two new letters without repetition.

 Some options:
 - ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but we have R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2. So that's not allowed. We must avoid putting R in position 2.

 - ""RODEO"": has O, D, E, O (repeats O) and R in position 1 -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word, but O is new. Also, we have E in position 4. But we don't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word. So we must include N.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try to find words that contain R, N, E and two new letters, without repeating and without placing R in position 2, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

 Example: 
 - ""RINSE"": R in 1, I, N in 3, S, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot put E at the end.

 - ""RENTS"": R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T, S -> 
   - R in 1: allowed (since we only know it's not in 2)
   - E in 2: allowed (we don't know about position 2 for E)
   - N in 3: allowed (we know it's not in 4, but 3 is okay)
   - T and S are new.

 But note: we have E in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have E in a different position. But we are trying to test multiple positions.

 Another option: ""NERDY"": N in 1, E in 2, R in 3, D, Y -> 
   - N in 1: allowed (we only know it's not in 4, so 1 is okay)
   - E in 2: allowed
   - R in 3: allowed (we know it's not in 2, but 3 is okay)
   - D and Y are new.

 But we are putting N at position 1 and E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but it's a test.

 However, we have to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C and A. Both ""RENTS"" and ""NERDY"" avoid C and A.

 Let me check if they are valid words: 
 - ""RENTS"": yes, it's a word.
 - ""NERDY"": yes.

 But we have three known letters: R, N, E. We are using them all. And we are testing two new letters.

 Another possibility: ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> 
   - N in position 2: we don't have any feedback about N in position 2? We only know N is not in position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
   - E in position 3: allowed.
   - R in position 4: allowed (since we know R is not in position 2, but 4 is okay).
   - I and T are new.

 But note: we are putting R in position 4 and N in position 2. We don't have any rule against N in position 2? Correct.

 However, we are not using the known letters in the same positions as before? We are free to try new positions.

 But we must avoid the positions that were ruled out for each letter.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RENTS"" -> R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5)
   - R: position 1 (not 2, so okay)
   - E: position 2 (not 5, so okay) -> but we don't know about position 2 for E? It might be correct or not.
   - N: position 3 (not 4, so okay)

 Option 2: ""NERDY"" -> N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5)
   - N:1, E:2, R:3 -> all in new positions.

 Option 3: ""INERT"" -> I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)
   - N:2, E:3, R:4 -> all in new positions.

 We want to test as many new positions as possible for the known letters and also test new letters.

 Also, we want to cover common letters. Let's test the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, N, D, L, etc.
 Common vowels: E, A (but A is out), O, I.

 Since A is out, we can try I and O.

 In ""RENTS"", we are testing S and T (both common).
 In ""NERDY"", we are testing D and Y (Y is less common).
 In ""INERT"", we are testing I and T (I is a vowel, T is common).

 We might prefer to test more common letters.

 Also, note that we have not tested the letter 'S' yet. It's very common.

 Another word: ""STERN"" -> S, T, E, R, N
   - S(1), T(2), E(3), R(4), N(5)
   - Check positions:
        R: position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
        E: position 3 (allowed, not 5)
        N: position 5 (allowed? we only know it's not in position 4. Position 5 is new, so allowed).

 This word uses S and T, which are common, and we are testing R, E, N in new positions.

 Also, we avoid C and A.

 Let me check the positions:
   - R is at 4: not 2 -> okay.
   - E is at 3: not 5 -> okay.
   - N is at 5: not 4 -> okay.

 So ""STERN"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we are putting N at the end (position 5). We don't have any feedback that N cannot be at 5? Only that it is not at 4. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, ""SNORE"": S, N, O, R, E -> 
   - S(1), N(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   - But E is at position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot use ""SNORE"".

 So ""STERN"" is better.

 Another option: ""ROBED"": R, O, B, E, D -> but we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip N.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes R, N, and E.

 Let me list a few words that include R, N, E and two new letters (without C, A) and without placing E at 5, R at 2, N at 4:

 - ""RENTS"": R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests T and S, common.
 - ""INTER"": I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
        R at 5: allowed (not 2)
        E at 4: allowed (not 5)
        N at 2: allowed (not 4)
 - ""MINER"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> same as above for R and E, N at 3 allowed.

 But note: we are allowed to have the known letters in any position except the ones we tried and got wrong.

 However, we are trying to get information about the positions of R, N, E.

 We can choose a word that places each of R, N, E in a position we haven't tried for that letter.

 For R: we tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and it was wrong. So we can try 1,3,4,5.
 For N: we tried position 4 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,5.
 For E: we tried position 5 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,4.

 In ""STERN"": 
   R is in position 4 (new for R)
   E is in position 3 (new for E)
   N is in position 5 (new for N)

 This tests three new positions.

 In ""RENTS"":
   R in 1 (new), E in 2 (new), N in 3 (new)

 Both are good.

 But ""STERN"" has the advantage of testing S and T, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> 
   T(1), R(2) -> but R in position 2 is not allowed! We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use ""TREND"".

 So ""STERN"" seems a solid choice.

 Let me confirm: 
   S (new) at 1, T (new) at 2, E at 3 (we know E is in the word, but we are testing position 3), R at 4 (testing position 4 for R), N at 5 (testing position 5 for N).

 We are testing two new common letters (S and T) and the known letters in new positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STERN"".

<guess>stern</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C** and **A** are absent from the secret word.  
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  
  - R is not in position 2.  
  - N is not in position 4.  
  - E is not in position 5.  

For the next guess, I prioritized:  
1. Including the known letters **R**, **N**, and **E** in new, untested positions.  
2. Avoiding **C** and **A**.  
3. Testing new common letters (**S** and **T**) for maximum information gain.  
4. Ensuring valid letter placements:  
   - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
   - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
   - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  

The word **""stern""** fits perfectly:  
- **S** (new) at position 1.  
- **T** (new) at position 2.  
- **E** at position 3 (previously untested for E).  
- **R** at position 4 (previously untested for R).  
- **N** at position 5 (previously untested for N).  

This tests all known letters in new positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (**S** and **T**).  

<guess>stern</guess>",stern,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(-)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word.

 - A is not in the secret word.
 - N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""crane"").
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position.

 However, we have to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C and A. Both ""RENTS"" and ""NERDY"" avoid C and A.

 Let me check if they are valid words: 
 - ""RENTS"": yes, it's a word.
 - ""NERDY"": yes.

 But we have three known letters: R, N, E. We are using them all. And we are testing two new letters.

 Another possibility: ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> 
   - N in position 2: we don't have any feedback about N in position 2? We only know N is not in position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
   - E in position 3: allowed.
   - R in position 4: allowed (since we know R is not in position 2, but 4 is okay).
   - I and T are new.

 But note: we are putting R in position 4 and N in position 2. We don't have any rule against N in position 2? Correct.

 However, we are not using the known letters in the same positions as before? We are free to try new positions.

 But we must avoid the positions that were ruled out for each letter.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RENTS"" -> R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5)
   - R: position 1 (not 2, so okay)
   - E: position 2 (not 5, so okay) -> but we don't know about position 2 for E? It might be correct or not.
   - N: position 3 (not 4, so okay)

 Option 2: ""NERDY"" -> N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5)
   - N:1, E:2, R:3 -> all in new positions.

 Option 3: ""INERT"" -> I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)
   - N:2, E:3, R:4 -> all in new positions.

 We want to test as many new positions as possible for the known letters and also test new letters.

 Also, we want to cover common letters. Let's test the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, N, D, L, etc.
 Common vowels: E, A (but A is out), O, I.

 Since A is out, we can try I and O.

 In ""RENTS"", we are testing S and T (both common).
 In ""NERDY"", we are testing D and Y (Y is less common).
 In ""INERT"", we are testing I and T (I is a vowel, T is common).

 We might prefer to test more common letters.

 Also, note that we have not tested the letter 'S' yet. It's very common.

 Another word: ""STERN"" -> S, T, E, R, N
   - S(1), T(2), E(3), R(4), N(5)
   - Check positions:
        R: position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
        E: position 3 (allowed, not 5)
        N: position 5 (allowed? we only know it's not in position 4. Position 5 is new, so allowed).

 This word uses S and T, which are common, and we are testing R, E, N in new positions.

 Also, we avoid C and A.

 Let me check the positions:
   - R is at 4: not 2 -> okay.
   - E is at 3: not 5 -> okay.
   - N is at 5: not 4 -> okay.

 So ""STERN"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we are putting N at the end (position 5). We don't have any feedback that N cannot be at 5? Only that it is not at 4. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, ""SNORE"": S, N, O, R, E -> 
   - S(1), N(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   - But E is at position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot use ""SNORE"".

 So ""STERN"" is better.

 Another option: ""ROBED"": R, O, B, E, D -> but we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip N.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes R, N, and E.

 Let me list a few words that include R, N, E and two new letters (without C, A) and without placing E at 5, R at 2, N at 4:

 - ""RENTS"": R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests T and S, common.
 - ""INTER"": I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
        R at 5: allowed (not 2)
        E at 4: allowed (not 5)
        N at 2: allowed (not 4)
 - ""MINER"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> same as above for R and E, N at 3 allowed.

 But note: we are allowed to have the known letters in any position except the ones we tried and got wrong.

 However, we are trying to get information about the positions of R, N, E.

 We can choose a word that places each of R, N, E in a position we haven't tried for that letter.

 For R: we tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and it was wrong. So we can try 1,3,4,5.
 For N: we tried position 4 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,5.
 For E: we tried position 5 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,4.

 In ""STERN"": 
   R is in position 4 (new for R)
   E is in position 3 (new for E)
   N is in position 5 (new for N)

 This tests three new positions.

 In ""RENTS"":
   R in 1 (new), E in 2 (new), N in 3 (new)

 Both are good.

 But ""STERN"" has the advantage of testing S and T, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> 
   T(1), R(2) -> but R in position 2 is not allowed! We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use ""TREND"".

 So ""STERN"" seems a solid choice.

 Let me confirm: 
   S (new) at 1, T (new) at 2, E at 3 (we know E is in the word, but we are testing position 3), R at 4 (testing position 4 for R), N at 5 (testing position 5 for N).

 We are testing two new common letters (S and T) and the known letters in new positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STERN"".

<guess>stern</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- **C** and **A** are absent from the secret word.  
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  
  - R is not in position 2.  
  - N is not in position 4.  
  - E is not in position 5.  

For the next guess, I prioritized:  
1. Including the known letters **R**, **N**, and **E** in new, untested positions.  
2. Avoiding **C** and **A**.  
3. Testing new common letters (**S** and **T**) for maximum information gain.  
4. Ensuring valid letter placements:  
   - R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
   - N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
   - E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  

The word **""stern""** fits perfectly:  
- **S** (new) at position 1.  
- **T** (new) at position 2.  
- **E** at position 3 (previously untested for E).  
- **R** at position 4 (previously untested for R).  
- **N** at position 5 (previously untested for N).  

This tests all known letters in new positions and introduces two high-frequency consonants (**S** and **T**).",Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no feedback from previous guesses. We should choose a word that maximizes the information gained, meaning it includes common letters and a variety of distinct letters.

Common English letters: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A good starting word often has 5 distinct letters and includes vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words are:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRATE
- ROAST
- SALET
- etc.

I will choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants. Let me use ""CRANE"".

It has:
- C, R, A, N, E

This covers common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

So my first guess: CRANE

But note: our goal is to represent thinking step by step and then output the guess.

Let me output accordingly.For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter English word that maximizes information gain. An effective starting word should include common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often recommended because they use frequent letters and have minimal repeats. 

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains two common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, allowing feedback to cover five different characters.
- The combination tests positions for multiple high-frequency letters, which can quickly reveal matches or eliminate possibilities.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(-)
 This means:
 - C is not in the secret word.
 - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""crane"").
 - A is not in the secret word.
 - N is in the secret word but not in the fourth position (since it was in the fourth position in ""crane"").
 - E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains R, N, and E, but not C or A.
 - R is not in position 2, N not in position 4, E not in position 5.

 Since R, N, and E are in the word, we should try to use a word that includes these and also tests new letters.

 We also know that the secret word does not contain C or A, so we avoid those.

 Let's think of a new word that:
 1. Includes R, N, E (since we know they are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions to find their correct spots).
 2. Avoids C and A.
 3. Uses new letters to test.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 The feedback for R, N, E is that they are present but in the wrong positions. So we should try to put them in positions that are not ruled out.

 Positions ruled out:
 - R cannot be in position 2.
 - N cannot be in position 4.
 - E cannot be in position 5.

 We can try to put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5; E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, we know the word has 5 letters, so we need to fill the other two letters with new ones.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tested: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 We should avoid repeating the letters we already know (R, N, E) in the same positions? Actually, we can try R in a new position, but we don't want to put R in position 2 again because we know it's not there. Similarly for N and E.

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to test two new letters.

 We can try to form a word that has R, N, E and two new letters.

 Example words: 
 - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don't know if there are duplicates. Also, we have E in two positions, but we know E is in the word but not at the end. Also, we have W as a new letter. However, we have R in position 1, E in 2, N in 3, E in 4, W in 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so W at 5 is okay. But we are using E twice? We don't know if the word has two E's. It's possible, but we have limited information. Also, we have R in position 1 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (which is allowed). But we are using E in position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are possible. However, we don't want to use the same letter twice if we can avoid it to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating letters.

 Let's think of words that have R, N, E and two new letters without repetition.

 Some options:
 - ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but we have R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2. So that's not allowed. We must avoid putting R in position 2.

 - ""RODEO"": has O, D, E, O (repeats O) and R in position 1 -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word, but O is new. Also, we have E in position 4. But we don't have N? We need to include N because we know it's in the word. So we must include N.

 We must include R, N, and E.

 Let me try to find words that contain R, N, E and two new letters, without repeating and without placing R in position 2, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

 Example: 
 - ""RINSE"": R in 1, I, N in 3, S, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot put E at the end.

 - ""RENTS"": R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T, S -> 
   - R in 1: allowed (since we only know it's not in 2)
   - E in 2: allowed (we don't know about position 2 for E)
   - N in 3: allowed (we know it's not in 4, but 3 is okay)
   - T and S are new.

 But note: we have E in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have E in a different position. But we are trying to test multiple positions.

 Another option: ""NERDY"": N in 1, E in 2, R in 3, D, Y -> 
   - N in 1: allowed (we only know it's not in 4, so 1 is okay)
   - E in 2: allowed
   - R in 3: allowed (we know it's not in 2, but 3 is okay)
   - D and Y are new.

 But we are putting N at position 1 and E at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but it's a test.

 However, we have to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C and A. Both ""RENTS"" and ""NERDY"" avoid C and A.

 Let me check if they are valid words: 
 - ""RENTS"": yes, it's a word.
 - ""NERDY"": yes.

 But we have three known letters: R, N, E. We are using them all. And we are testing two new letters.

 Another possibility: ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> 
   - N in position 2: we don't have any feedback about N in position 2? We only know N is not in position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
   - E in position 3: allowed.
   - R in position 4: allowed (since we know R is not in position 2, but 4 is okay).
   - I and T are new.

 But note: we are putting R in position 4 and N in position 2. We don't have any rule against N in position 2? Correct.

 However, we are not using the known letters in the same positions as before? We are free to try new positions.

 But we must avoid the positions that were ruled out for each letter.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""RENTS"" -> R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5)
   - R: position 1 (not 2, so okay)
   - E: position 2 (not 5, so okay) -> but we don't know about position 2 for E? It might be correct or not.
   - N: position 3 (not 4, so okay)

 Option 2: ""NERDY"" -> N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5)
   - N:1, E:2, R:3 -> all in new positions.

 Option 3: ""INERT"" -> I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)
   - N:2, E:3, R:4 -> all in new positions.

 We want to test as many new positions as possible for the known letters and also test new letters.

 Also, we want to cover common letters. Let's test the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.

 Common consonants: S, T, R, N, D, L, etc.
 Common vowels: E, A (but A is out), O, I.

 Since A is out, we can try I and O.

 In ""RENTS"", we are testing S and T (both common).
 In ""NERDY"", we are testing D and Y (Y is less common).
 In ""INERT"", we are testing I and T (I is a vowel, T is common).

 We might prefer to test more common letters.

 Also, note that we have not tested the letter 'S' yet. It's very common.

 Another word: ""STERN"" -> S, T, E, R, N
   - S(1), T(2), E(3), R(4), N(5)
   - Check positions:
        R: position 4 (allowed, since not 2)
        E: position 3 (allowed, not 5)
        N: position 5 (allowed? we only know it's not in position 4. Position 5 is new, so allowed).

 This word uses S and T, which are common, and we are testing R, E, N in new positions.

 Also, we avoid C and A.

 Let me check the positions:
   - R is at 4: not 2 -> okay.
   - E is at 3: not 5 -> okay.
   - N is at 5: not 4 -> okay.

 So ""STERN"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we are putting N at the end (position 5). We don't have any feedback that N cannot be at 5? Only that it is not at 4. So it's okay.

 Alternatively, ""SNORE"": S, N, O, R, E -> 
   - S(1), N(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   - But E is at position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot use ""SNORE"".

 So ""STERN"" is better.

 Another option: ""ROBED"": R, O, B, E, D -> but we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip N.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes R, N, and E.

 Let me list a few words that include R, N, E and two new letters (without C, A) and without placing E at 5, R at 2, N at 4:

 - ""RENTS"": R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests T and S, common.
 - ""INTER"": I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
        R at 5: allowed (not 2)
        E at 4: allowed (not 5)
        N at 2: allowed (not 4)
 - ""MINER"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> same as above for R and E, N at 3 allowed.

 But note: we are allowed to have the known letters in any position except the ones we tried and got wrong.

 However, we are trying to get information about the positions of R, N, E.

 We can choose a word that places each of R, N, E in a position we haven't tried for that letter.

 For R: we tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and it was wrong. So we can try 1,3,4,5.
 For N: we tried position 4 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,5.
 For E: we tried position 5 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,4.

 In ""STERN"": 
   R is in position 4 (new for R)
   E is in position 3 (new for E)
   N is in position 5 (new for N)

 This tests three new positions.

 In ""RENTS"":
   R in 1 (new), E in 2 (new), N in 3 (new)

 Both are good.

 But ""STERN"" has the advantage of testing S and T, which are very common.

 Alternatively, ""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> 
   T(1), R(2) -> but R in position 2 is not allowed! We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use ""TREND"".

 So ""STERN"" seems a solid choice.

 Let me confirm: 
   S (new) at 1, T (new) at 2, E at 3 (we know E is in the word, but we are testing position 3), R at 4 (testing position 4 for R), N at 5 (testing position 5 for N).

 We are testing two new common letters (S and T) and the known letters in new positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STERN"".

Actually, we can try R in a new position, but we don\'t want to put R in position 2 again because we know it\'s not there. Similarly for N and E.\n\n We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to test two new letters.\n\n We can try to form a word that has R, N, E and two new letters.\n\n Example words: \n - ""RENEW"" -> but E is repeated? We don\'t know if there are duplicates. Also, we have E in two positions, but we know E is in the word but not at the end. Also, we have W as a new letter. However, we have R in position 1, E in 2, N in 3, E in 4, W in 5. But we know E is not at position 5, so W at 5 is okay. But we are using E twice? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. It\'s possible, but we have limited information. Also, we have R in position 1 (which is allowed) and N in position 3 (which is allowed). But we are using E in position 2 and 4. We know E is in the word but not at position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are possible. However, we don\'t want to use the same letter twice if we can avoid it to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating letters.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have R, N, E and two new letters without repetition.\n\n Some options:\n - ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> but we have R in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2. So that\'s not allowed. We must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n - ""RODEO"": has O, D, E, O (repeats O) and R in position 1 -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word, but O is new. Also, we have E in position 4. But we don\'t have N? We need to include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we must include N.\n\n We must include R, N, and E.\n\n Let me try to find words that contain R, N, E and two new letters, without repeating and without placing R in position 2, N in position 4, or E in position 5.\n\n Example: \n - ""RINSE"": R in 1, I, N in 3, S, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot put E at the end.\n\n - ""RENTS"": R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T, S -> \n   - R in 1: allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 2)\n   - E in 2: allowed (we don\'t know about position 2 for E)\n   - N in 3: allowed (we know it\'s not in 4, but 3 is okay)\n   - T and S are new.\n\n But note: we have E in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have E in a different position. But we are trying to test multiple positions.\n\n Another option: ""NERDY"": N in 1, E in 2, R in 3, D, Y -> \n   - N in 1: allowed (we only know it\'s not in 4, so 1 is okay)\n   - E in 2: allowed\n   - R in 3: allowed (we know it\'s not in 2, but 3 is okay)\n   - D and Y are new.\n\n But we are putting N at position 1 and E at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but it\'s a test.\n\n However, we have to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C and A. Both ""RENTS"" and ""NERDY"" avoid C and A.\n\n Let me check if they are valid words: \n - ""RENTS"": yes, it\'s a word.\n - ""NERDY"": yes.\n\n But we have three known letters: R, N, E. We are using them all. And we are testing two new letters.\n\n Another possibility: ""INERT"": I, N, E, R, T -> \n   - N in position 2: we don\'t have any feedback about N in position 2? We only know N is not in position 4. So position 2 is allowed.\n   - E in position 3: allowed.\n   - R in position 4: allowed (since we know R is not in position 2, but 4 is okay).\n   - I and T are new.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 4 and N in position 2. We don\'t have any rule against N in position 2? Correct.\n\n However, we are not using the known letters in the same positions as before? We are free to try new positions.\n\n But we must avoid the positions that were ruled out for each letter.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""RENTS"" -> R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5)\n   - R: position 1 (not 2, so okay)\n   - E: position 2 (not 5, so okay) -> but we don\'t know about position 2 for E? It might be correct or not.\n   - N: position 3 (not 4, so okay)\n\n Option 2: ""NERDY"" -> N(1), E(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5)\n   - N:1, E:2, R:3 -> all in new positions.\n\n Option 3: ""INERT"" -> I(1), N(2), E(3), R(4), T(5)\n   - N:2, E:3, R:4 -> all in new positions.\n\n We want to test as many new positions as possible for the known letters and also test new letters.\n\n Also, we want to cover common letters. Let\'s test the frequency of letters in English 5-letter words.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, R, N, D, L, etc.\n Common vowels: E, A (but A is out), O, I.\n\n Since A is out, we can try I and O.\n\n In ""RENTS"", we are testing S and T (both common).\n In ""NERDY"", we are testing D and Y (Y is less common).\n In ""INERT"", we are testing I and T (I is a vowel, T is common).\n\n We might prefer to test more common letters.\n\n Also, note that we have not tested the letter \'S\' yet. It\'s very common.\n\n Another word: ""STERN"" -> S, T, E, R, N\n   - S(1), T(2), E(3), R(4), N(5)\n   - Check positions:\n        R: position 4 (allowed, since not 2)\n        E: position 3 (allowed, not 5)\n        N: position 5 (allowed? we only know it\'s not in position 4. Position 5 is new, so allowed).\n\n This word uses S and T, which are common, and we are testing R, E, N in new positions.\n\n Also, we avoid C and A.\n\n Let me check the positions:\n   - R is at 4: not 2 -> okay.\n   - E is at 3: not 5 -> okay.\n   - N is at 5: not 4 -> okay.\n\n So ""STERN"" seems a good candidate.\n\n But note: we are putting N at the end (position 5). We don\'t have any feedback that N cannot be at 5? Only that it is not at 4. So it\'s okay.\n\n Alternatively, ""SNORE"": S, N, O, R, E -> \n   - S(1), N(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)\n   - But E is at position 5, which is ruled out (from feedback: E not in position 5). So we cannot use ""SNORE"".\n\n So ""STERN"" is better.\n\n Another option: ""ROBED"": R, O, B, E, D -> but we are missing N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip N.\n\n Therefore, we must have a word that includes R, N, and E.\n\n Let me list a few words that include R, N, E and two new letters (without C, A) and without placing E at 5, R at 2, N at 4:\n\n - ""RENTS"": R(1), E(2), N(3), T(4), S(5) -> tests T and S, common.\n - ""INTER"": I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n        R at 5: allowed (not 2)\n        E at 4: allowed (not 5)\n        N at 2: allowed (not 4)\n - ""MINER"": M(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> same as above for R and E, N at 3 allowed.\n\n But note: we are allowed to have the known letters in any position except the ones we tried and got wrong.\n\n However, we are trying to get information about the positions of R, N, E.\n\n We can choose a word that places each of R, N, E in a position we haven\'t tried for that letter.\n\n For R: we tried position 2 (in ""crane"") and it was wrong. So we can try 1,3,4,5.\n For N: we tried position 4 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,5.\n For E: we tried position 5 (wrong) so we can try 1,2,3,4.\n\n In ""STERN"": \n   R is in position 4 (new for R)\n   E is in position 3 (new for E)\n   N is in position 5 (new for N)\n\n This tests three new positions.\n\n In ""RENTS"":\n   R in 1 (new), E in 2 (new), N in 3 (new)\n\n Both are good.\n\n But ""STERN"" has the advantage of testing S and T, which are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""TREND"": T, R, E, N, D -> \n   T(1), R(2) -> but R in position 2 is not allowed! We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot use ""TREND"".\n\n So ""STERN"" seems a solid choice.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   S (new) at 1, T (new) at 2, E at 3 (we know E is in the word, but we are testing position 3), R at 4 (testing position 4 for R), N at 5 (testing position 5 for N).\n\n We are testing two new common letters (S and T) and the known letters in new positions.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STERN"".\n\n<guess>stern</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- **C** and **A** are absent from the secret word.  \n- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions:  \n  - R is not in position 2.  \n  - N is not in position 4.  \n  - E is not in position 5.  \n\nFor the next guess, I prioritized:  \n1. Including the known letters **R**, **N**, and **E** in new, untested positions.  \n2. Avoiding **C** and **A**.  \n3. Testing new common letters (**S** and **T**) for maximum information gain.  \n4.

We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(-)
   Interpretation: 
     - C and A are not in the secret word at all.
     - R is in the word but not in position 2.
     - N is in the word but not in position 4.
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: ""stern"" -> S(x), T(x), E(-), R(-), N(✓)
   Interpretation:
     - S and T are not in the secret word at all.
     - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stern"").
     - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stern"").
     - N is in the word and in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and got ✓).

Key deductions:
- N is confirmed to be in position 5. So the secret word ends with N.
- The secret word contains R and E (but we don't know their positions yet) and does not contain C, A, S, T.
- From ""crane"", we knew E is not in position 5 (which we now know is occupied by N) and R is not in position 2.
- From ""stern"", E is not in position 3 and R is not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The secret word is _ _ _ _ N
- Letters present: R, E, N (and we know N is at position 5)
- Letters absent: C, A, S, T

We have two known letters: R and E, which must be placed in the first four positions, but avoiding:
  - For R: positions 2 and 4 (since from ""crane"" it was in 2 and was wrong, and from ""stern"" in 4 was wrong)
  - For E: positions 5 (known from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""stern"")

So R can only be in position 1 or 3.
E can only be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since the word has only 5 positions and we know position 5 is N, the other three positions (1,2,3) must be filled with R, E, and one additional letter that we don't know (since R and E are two, and we have three other positions: 1,2,3,4? Note: positions 1,2,3,4 for the first four letters, but we have R and E and two more? We have four positions (1-4) and only two known letters (R and E), so we need two more letters? But wait: total letters: the word must contain R and E and N (position 5). But N is only one letter, so we have three known letters? Then the remaining two letters must be other letters we haven't tested.

Actually, from the feedback, we know the secret word has R, E, N. But we don't know any other letters. We have eliminated C, A, S, T. There might be two more letters we haven't guessed.

Therefore, the secret word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> with 5 being N. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain R, E, and two other letters.

But we know the word has at least R, E, and N (position 5). So the other two letters are unknowns.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5).
- Contains R and E (so we have R, E, N and two new letters).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, A, S, T.
- Places R only in position 1 or 3 (because it cannot be in 2 or 4).
- Places E only in position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be in 3 or 5).

Additionally, we must use a valid English word.

Let's think of possible words ending with N and containing R and E.

Some possibilities:
- Words ending with ""EN"" but note: we have ...N at the end, so the last two letters could be _ _ _ N, and we know N is last so it's fixed as the fifth letter.

We can consider words ending with N that have R and E in the first four letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong for R and E.

Let me brainstorm:

Common patterns: 
  - Words ending in ""REN"": but we know R cannot be at position 4? Actually, this would be ...R E N, so R at position 3? and E at 4? But we have:
      Position 3: R? 
      Position 4: E?
      Position 5: N.

But from feedback, R cannot be in position 4? Wait, in ""stern"", R was in position 4 and we got (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4. So R cannot be in position 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in position 3 (from ""stern"").

So:
- If we have a word like ...E at position 4? That's allowed because E can be in 4.

But let's generate words.

Consider R in position 1 or 3.

Option 1: R at position 1.
  Then the word: R _ _ _ N
  E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (but not 4? wait, positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:N.
  E can be in positions 2,3,4? But we know E cannot be in position 3 (from ""stern"" feedback). So E can only be in position 2 or 4.

  So:
    Pattern: R E _ _ N -> then E in 2? and then we have to fill position 3 and 4.
    Or: R _ _ E N -> with E in 4.

  But also, we might have E at position 4 without being in 2 or 3.

  Let's try to form words:

  Possibility: R E _ _ N -> example: ""REIGN"" -> R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). 
    Now, note: E is at position 2. But we are allowed to put E at 2? Yes, because from feedback we only know E cannot be at 3 or 5. Position 2 is okay.

  Check letters: I and G are new, and we avoided C,A,S,T.

  Another: ""RESIN"" -> but S is forbidden? We know S is absent, so no.
  ""RECON"" -> but C is forbidden? No.

  ""REIGN"", ""REBAN"" -> but B is new and A is forbidden? A is absent, so ""REBAN"" is not allowed? Also ""REBAN"" has A which is not allowed.

  Other possibilities: ""REBUN""? Not a word.

  ""REGION"" -> 6 letters.

  Alternatively, R _ _ E N -> 
      Example: ""RIPEN"" -> R(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), N(5). 
        This would work: letters I and P are new, not forbidden.

  ""RIVEN"" -> V is allowed.

Option 2: R at position 3.
  Then: _ _ R _ N
  E can be in position 1, 2, or 4? But position 3 we have R, so E cannot be there? And we know E cannot be in position 3 anyway. So E in 1, 2, or 4.

  So patterns:
    - E _ R _ N -> E at position 1, then two more letters to fill.
    - _ E R _ N -> E at position 2.
    - _ _ R E N -> E at position 4.

  Examples:
    ""EERIN"" -> not a word? ""BERIN""? Not valid.

    ""BEIRN""? Not a word.

    More common: ""PERIL"" but not ending with N.

    Ending with ""R E N"": like _ _ R E N -> ""BOREN"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), N(5). 
        Then letters B and O are new.

    ""WAREN""? Not sure.

    ""BAREN"" -> has A? Forbidden.

    ""FEREN""? Not common.

    ""DIREN""? D(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), N(5). This would work.

  But we must use valid words.

Also, we must consider that we haven't tested many letters. We know C, A, S, T are absent. We can use any other letters.

Now, we have two possible patterns:
Pattern A (R at 1): 
  R [vowel or consonant] [something] [E? or something] N -> e.g., ""REIGN"", ""RIPEN""

Pattern B (R at 3):
  [letter] [letter] R [E?] N -> e.g., ""DIREN"" (if valid) or ""BOREN"" (if valid).

But we need a valid word.

More common words:
  For R at 1 and E at 2: ""REIGN"" (valid)
  For R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPEN"" (valid)
  For R at 3 and E at 4: There are words like ""SIREN"" -> but S is forbidden? We cannot use S. So ""DIREN"" is not a word? 
      Actually, ""DRIEN"" is not a word. We need a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 4? 
      Word: ""URBEN"" -> not common. 
      Word ""MOREN"" -> not standard.

  For R at 3 and E at 1: ""EXERN""? No.
  For R at 3 and E at 2: ""HERN"" is 4 letters?  _ E R _ N -> ""BERYN""? Not common.

So perhaps pattern A is more fruitful.

We can consider E at position 1 independently? But above we have put R at 1.

Another possibility: what if R and E are not the only letters? We have to use two more letters.

We have eliminated S,T,C,A. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels left: I, O, U? We should try to include vowels to form words.

Now, for the next guess, we want to maximize information. We need to find the positions of R and E and also discover the other two letters.

We have two known letters: R and E (and N fixed). We can try to place R in one of the allowed positions (1 or 3) and E in one of the allowed positions (1,2,4) but note: if we place both, we must avoid conflict.

Since we know position 5 is N, we can focus on the first four.

What if we try a word that places R at position 1 and E at position 2? That would be ""RE"" in the beginning, and then two letters before N.

Word: ""REIGN"" -> R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). 
  We can test I and G.

But note: what if the word is ""RIPEN""? Then we would have E at position 4. How to distinguish?

We could try a word that tests both possibilities? But we can't test two at once.

Alternatively, we could test R at position 3? That would tell us immediately whether R is at 1 or 3? Because if we guess R at 3 and it appears as ✓, then we know R is at 3. If it's (-), then we know R is not at 3 so it must be at 1.

Similarly for E: we can test E in a specific position.

So let's design a guess that tests either R in position 3 or E in a position where we have uncertainty.

But note: we are limited by the word constraints.

Idea: use a word that puts R in position 3 to test that hypothesis. If R is there, we get ✓. If not, then R must be at 1.

Similarly, we can also test E in position 4? Because E can be in 4.

For example, guess a word that has:
  - R in position 3 (to see if it's correct)
  - E in position 4 (to see if it's correct)
  - And we know N is fixed at 5.

So the last three letters: R E N? Then we need two letters before that.

Word pattern: _ _ R E N

We need to fill the first two letters. And we must avoid forbidden letters: C, A, S, T.

Possible words?
  ""O R E N"" -> ""OREN"" is 4 letters? We need 5: _ _ R E N -> so two letters: [consonant?][vowel?] R E N.

  Examples:
    ""BOREN"" -> not a standard word.
    ""BAREN"" -> has A, forbidden.
    ""WIREN"" -> W-I-R-E-N: W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), N(5) -> ""wiren"" isn't commonly recognized? But ""wire"" is with N? Not a standard word.

  ""BUREN"" -> not common.

  ""DIREN"" -> not a word.

  ""FIREN"" -> firen? Not valid.

It's difficult. Let's check ""GREEN"" -> but G-R-E-E-N, has E repeated? Also, E at position 3 is forbidden? But we are putting E at 4? But there is also E at position 2? And we don't know if E is repeated? But we haven't been told about repeated letters. However, note that the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates separately. But in the first guess, E was at 5 and we got (-), which means there is at least one E. Similarly, if there were duplicate E, we might not know.

For ""GREEN"": G, R, E, E, N -> 
  Positions: G(1), R(2)? -> but R cannot be at position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2 because of ""crane"". So in this word, R is at position 2? That's illegal.

So we cannot put R at position 2.

Therefore, for the pattern _ _ R E N, we have to put R at position 3, which is allowed? But we don't have position 2 as R? We are putting R at 3.

But the word ""HOREN"" -> not standard.

Perhaps we should avoid this pattern because it's hard to find a common word.

Then, let's go to R at position 1. Then we can try E in position 2 or position 4.

To decide between these two, we can choose a word that places E at position 2 and then try ""REIGN"". If E is really at 2, it will show as ✓. If not, we'll get (-) and then we know E is at 4.

Similarly, if we try ""RIPEN"", we test E at 4.

Both are valid words.

But which one to pick? We can choose one arbitrarily or based on letter frequency.

Let me pick ""REIGN"" because:
- It tests E at position 2, which is a common position.
- It uses G and I, which are common letters.

So:

Pattern: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

If feedback for E is ✓, then we know E is at position 2. Otherwise, if E is (-) then it is in the word but not in 2, so then it must be at 4 (since the only other possibility for E is 1 or 4, but we have R at 1? Then E cannot be at 1? Wait: position 1 is R? So E can only be at 4? Or we have conflict?

But wait: if E is at position 2 and we guess ""REIGN"", then:
  - If E is indeed at 2: we get E(✓)
  - If E is not at 2 but in the word, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but at a different position.

But what are the possible positions for E? Only 1,2,4? But in our guess, position 1 is R, we assume? But we are putting R at position 1? So E cannot be at position 1? Then E must be at 4? Therefore:

If in ""REIGN"" we get E(-), that would be inconsistent because the only remaining position for E is 4? But we don't have E at 4 in the guess? We have E at 2. So if E is not at 2, then it must be at 4? So we would get E(-) and that implies E is in the word at position 4? But we don't have a letter at position 4? Wait, we have G at position 4.

But to have E(-) in position 2, it means E is in the secret word in a different position. The only possible position we haven't ruled out is position 4? Since position 1 is taken by R? But in the secret word, position 1 could be E? But then R wouldn't be at 1? Wait, we are assuming R is at 1? But actually, we don't know for sure that R is at 1. We are testing R at 1? Yes.

So actually, if we guess ""REIGN"":
- Position 1: R -> if R is at 1, then ✓. If not? Then R is at position 3? But we are putting R at 1. So if we get R(-), then R is in the word but not at 1, so it must be at position 3? 
- Position 2: E -> if E is at 2, ✓; or if E is elsewhere? Then (-) meaning E is not at 2.

Wait, let's break down the possibilities:

Case 1: R is at position 1:
  Then E must be at 2 or 4? Since E cannot be in 3 (ruled out by ""stern"") and not in 5 (ruled out by ""crane""). In the secret word, position 1 is R, so E cannot be at 1? Then E must be at 2 or 4.
  - If E is at 2: then we should get E(✓) for ""REIGN"".
  - If E is at 4: then we get E(-) for position 2? And also, we have I at position 3 and G at 4? Then E is at 4, so G might be something else? So we would get feedback on G and I.

Case 2: R is at position 3:
  Then we cannot have R at position 1? So if R is at 3, in ""REIGN"":
    - R in position 1 would be wrong, so R(x)? But wait no: R is in the word? So it would be R(-) meaning R is present but not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3? 
    And then we get feedback that R is present (and we know it must be at 3? because we haven't tested position 3?).

But actually, we don't know for sure. But we are testing position 1 for R? So:

We can interpret:

If we guess ""REIGN"":

- If R gets ✓: then R is at position 1. And E could be at 2 or 4? 
   Then E at 2: ✓, or at 4: (-)

- If R gets (-): then R is in the word but not at 1, so since we know R must be at 1 or 3, then it must be at position 3? 
  And E: then E at 2? If E is at 2, we could get ✓? Or if E is not at 2? Then we get (-) meaning E is at 4? Because E cannot be at 1 (because we have R at 1? but no: the secret word position 1: not R? Then E can be at position 1? Or at 4? Or at 2? Or ... wait: we have eliminated positions 3 and 5 for E? So only 1,2,4. So E could be at 1? But we are guessing E at 2.

Actually, it's complicated.

Alternatively, we could test the R position explicitly by placing R in position 3 in this guess? That would clarify R's position.

But earlier we didn't find a good word for R at 3? Let's try again to find a word with R at position 3 and E at position 4? That way, if R is at 3, we get ✓ for R? And if E is at 4, we get ✓ for E? And we know position 5 is N? Then we only need to fill the first two letters.

Word pattern: _ _, R, E, N -> two letters, then ""REN"".

So the word is ? ? R E N.

5-letter words ending with ""REN"": 
  Valid words?
  ""BOREN""? Not common.
  ""BAREN"" -> forbidden A.
  ""SIREN"" -> forbidden S.
  ""WIREN"" -> doesn't appear in the dictionary.
  ""KEREN""? Not standard.
  ""DIREN"", ""FIREN"", ""GIREN"", ""HIREN"", ""LIREN"", ""MIREN"" -> not words.

What about ""TREEN""? But T is forbidden? We cannot use T.

""GREEN"" -> but G-R-E-E-N: positions: G(1), R(2)? -> R in position 2 is not allowed. And also, we would have two E's? But we are putting E at position 3 in ""GREEN""? So position 1: G, 2: R (forbidden?), 3: E, 4: E, 5: N? But R at 2 is forbidden -> we know R cannot be at 2. So ""GREEN"" is invalid for guessing because we cannot put R at 2.

Another possibility: ""OAREN""? Not a word.

Maybe ""PUREN"" ... not common.

Perhaps we should use a word with R at 3 but E not necessarily at 4? Like E at 1 or 2.

For example:

Pattern: E _ R _ N -> E at position 1: allowed? because we haven't tested position 1 for E? And if we put E at 1: then the word starts with E and ends with R E N? Not likely.

Word: ""EERIE"" doesn't end with N.

""EEREN"" -> not a word.

Alternatively, pattern: _ E R _ N -> with E at position 2: allowed? and R at 3.

Examples: 
  ""LEARN"" -> but L-E-A-R-N: A is forbidden? No. And also, we are putting A? A is forbidden -> so no.
  ""BER"" pattern: ""YEARN"" -> Y-E-A-R-N: A is forbidden? Yes. 
  ""HEARN""? Not valid.
  ""BEARN"" -> A forbidden.

""PER"" pattern: ""PERON"" -> P-E-R-O-N: E(2), R(3)? But what's the feedback? We are guessing:
  P(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)

This might be a valid word? ""Peron"" as a name? But we need common English words.

Common words: 
  ""HERON"" -> H-E-R-O-N: 
    - E at position 2? allowed? Yes.
    - R at position 3? allowed? Yes.
    - H at 1 and O at 4: new letters.
    - Avoids forbidden letters: H, O are new and not in forbidden list.

But ""HERON"" ends with N. And it has R at 3 and E at 2? This matches.

So ""HERON"": 
  - Position 1: H
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: O
  - Position 5: N

Now, this tests:
  - R at position 3: if it's correct, we get ✓. If it's not correct, then R must be at position 1? 
  - E at position 2: if correct, ✓. If not, then E must be in a different position (1 or 4?).

But note: E can also be at position 4? And position 2 is the only one we are testing here.

Thus, ""HERON"" is a valid word that tests the R position (3) and the E position (2) simultaneously.

Moreover, it introduces two new letters: H and O.

We are using it even though S,T,A,C are absent? Yes, H and O are not forbidden.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""HERON"".

If we get R at 3 as ✓, then we know R's position. If not, we know R is at 1. Similarly, for E.

<guess>heron</guess>With the secret word ending in N (position 5 confirmed) and containing R and E (exact positions unknown), plus two additional unknown letters:  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, S, T**.  
- **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → only positions 1 or 3 possible.  
- **E** cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, or 4 possible.  

To resolve the position of **R**, I prioritized testing it in position 3 via **""heron""**:  
- **H** (1), **E** (2), **R** (3), **O** (4), **N** (5).  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (if ✓, R is confirmed at position 3; if (-), R must be at position 1).  
- Simultaneously tests **E** in position 2 (if ✓ or (-), it narrows **E**’s position).  
- Introduces **H** and **O** as new common letters.  

This maximizes information on key letter placements while adhering to constraints.

<guess>heron</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
- C and A are absent from the secret word.  
- R, N, and E are present but not in the positions guessed (R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""stern""):**  
- S and T are absent from the secret word.  
- E and R are present but not in the positions guessed (E not at 3, R not at 4).  
- N is present and correctly positioned at 5.  

### Key Conclusions:
- The secret word ends with N (position 5).  
- The secret word contains R and E (exact positions unknown).  
- Letters C, A, S, T are eliminated.  
- R can only be in positions 1 or 3 (ruled out: 2 and 4).  
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out: 3 and 5).  
- Two additional unknown letters need to be discovered.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
To resolve R and E's positions and identify new letters, I selected **""heron""** because:  
- Places **R in position 3** to test the hypothesis that R belongs there. If correct, feedback will show ✓; if not (feedback: - or x), R must be at position 1.  
- Places **E in position 2** to test its possible location.  
- **H and O** are new common letters that haven't been tested.  
- The word avoids eliminated letters (C, A, S, T).  
- It adheres to the constraints for E and R positions.  

This guess maximizes positional information while efficiently narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>heron</guess>",heron,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(-)
   Interpretation: 
     - C and A are not in the secret word at all.
     - R is in the word but not in position 2.
     - N is in the word but not in position 4.
     - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Guess 2: ""stern"" -> S(x), T(x), E(-), R(-), N(✓)
   Interpretation:
     - S and T are not in the secret word at all.
     - E is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stern"").
     - R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stern"").
     - N is in the word and in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and got ✓).

Key deductions:
- N is confirmed to be in position 5. So the secret word ends with N.
- The secret word contains R and E (but we don't know their positions yet) and does not contain C, A, S, T.
- From ""crane"", we knew E is not in position 5 (which we now know is occupied by N) and R is not in position 2.
- From ""stern"", E is not in position 3 and R is not in position 4.

Therefore:
- The secret word is _ _ _ _ N
- Letters present: R, E, N (and we know N is at position 5)
- Letters absent: C, A, S, T

We have two known letters: R and E, which must be placed in the first four positions, but avoiding:
  - For R: positions 2 and 4 (since from ""crane"" it was in 2 and was wrong, and from ""stern"" in 4 was wrong)
  - For E: positions 5 (known from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""stern"")

So R can only be in position 1 or 3.
E can only be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Since the word has only 5 positions and we know position 5 is N, the other three positions (1,2,3) must be filled with R, E, and one additional letter that we don't know (since R and E are two, and we have three other positions: 1,2,3,4? Note: positions 1,2,3,4 for the first four letters, but we have R and E and two more? We have four positions (1-4) and only two known letters (R and E), so we need two more letters? But wait: total letters: the word must contain R and E and N (position 5). But N is only one letter, so we have three known letters? Then the remaining two letters must be other letters we haven't tested.

Actually, from the feedback, we know the secret word has R, E, N. But we don't know any other letters. We have eliminated C, A, S, T. There might be two more letters we haven't guessed.

Therefore, the secret word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 -> with 5 being N. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain R, E, and two other letters.

But we know the word has at least R, E, and N (position 5). So the other two letters are unknowns.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5).
- Contains R and E (so we have R, E, N and two new letters).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, A, S, T.
- Places R only in position 1 or 3 (because it cannot be in 2 or 4).
- Places E only in position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be in 3 or 5).

Additionally, we must use a valid English word.

Let's think of possible words ending with N and containing R and E.

Some possibilities:
- Words ending with ""EN"" but note: we have ...N at the end, so the last two letters could be _ _ _ N, and we know N is last so it's fixed as the fifth letter.

We can consider words ending with N that have R and E in the first four letters, avoiding positions we know are wrong for R and E.

Let me brainstorm:

Common patterns: 
  - Words ending in ""REN"": but we know R cannot be at position 4? Actually, this would be ...R E N, so R at position 3? and E at 4? But we have:
      Position 3: R? 
      Position 4: E?
      Position 5: N.

But from feedback, R cannot be in position 4? Wait, in ""stern"", R was in position 4 and we got (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 4. So R cannot be in position 4.

Similarly, E cannot be in position 3 (from ""stern"").

So:
- If we have a word like ...E at position 4? That's allowed because E can be in 4.

But let's generate words.

Consider R in position 1 or 3.

Option 1: R at position 1.
  Then the word: R _ _ _ N
  E must be in one of positions 2,3,4 (but not 4? wait, positions: 1:R, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:N.
  E can be in positions 2,3,4? But we know E cannot be in position 3 (from ""stern"" feedback). So E can only be in position 2 or 4.

  So:
    Pattern: R E _ _ N -> then E in 2? and then we have to fill position 3 and 4.
    Or: R _ _ E N -> with E in 4.

  But also, we might have E at position 4 without being in 2 or 3.

  Let's try to form words:

  Possibility: R E _ _ N -> example: ""REIGN"" -> R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). 
    Now, note: E is at position 2. But we are allowed to put E at 2? Yes, because from feedback we only know E cannot be at 3 or 5. Position 2 is okay.

  Check letters: I and G are new, and we avoided C,A,S,T.

  Another: ""RESIN"" -> but S is forbidden? We know S is absent, so no.
  ""RECON"" -> but C is forbidden? No.

  ""REIGN"", ""REBAN"" -> but B is new and A is forbidden? A is absent, so ""REBAN"" is not allowed? Also ""REBAN"" has A which is not allowed.

  Other possibilities: ""REBUN""? Not a word.

  ""REGION"" -> 6 letters.

  Alternatively, R _ _ E N -> 
      Example: ""RIPEN"" -> R(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), N(5). 
        This would work: letters I and P are new, not forbidden.

  ""RIVEN"" -> V is allowed.

Option 2: R at position 3.
  Then: _ _ R _ N
  E can be in position 1, 2, or 4? But position 3 we have R, so E cannot be there? And we know E cannot be in position 3 anyway. So E in 1, 2, or 4.

  So patterns:
    - E _ R _ N -> E at position 1, then two more letters to fill.
    - _ E R _ N -> E at position 2.
    - _ _ R E N -> E at position 4.

  Examples:
    ""EERIN"" -> not a word? ""BERIN""? Not valid.

    ""BEIRN""? Not a word.

    More common: ""PERIL"" but not ending with N.

    Ending with ""R E N"": like _ _ R E N -> ""BOREN"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), N(5). 
        Then letters B and O are new.

    ""WAREN""? Not sure.

    ""BAREN"" -> has A? Forbidden.

    ""FEREN""? Not common.

    ""DIREN""? D(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), N(5). This would work.

  But we must use valid words.

Also, we must consider that we haven't tested many letters. We know C, A, S, T are absent. We can use any other letters.

Now, we have two possible patterns:
Pattern A (R at 1): 
  R [vowel or consonant] [something] [E? or something] N -> e.g., ""REIGN"", ""RIPEN""

Pattern B (R at 3):
  [letter] [letter] R [E?] N -> e.g., ""DIREN"" (if valid) or ""BOREN"" (if valid).

But we need a valid word.

More common words:
  For R at 1 and E at 2: ""REIGN"" (valid)
  For R at 1 and E at 4: ""RIPEN"" (valid)
  For R at 3 and E at 4: There are words like ""SIREN"" -> but S is forbidden? We cannot use S. So ""DIREN"" is not a word? 
      Actually, ""DRIEN"" is not a word. We need a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 4? 
      Word: ""URBEN"" -> not common. 
      Word ""MOREN"" -> not standard.

  For R at 3 and E at 1: ""EXERN""? No.
  For R at 3 and E at 2: ""HERN"" is 4 letters?  _ E R _ N -> ""BERYN""? Not common.

So perhaps pattern A is more fruitful.

We can consider E at position 1 independently? But above we have put R at 1.

Another possibility: what if R and E are not the only letters? We have to use two more letters.

We have eliminated S,T,C,A. We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common vowels left: I, O, U? We should try to include vowels to form words.

Now, for the next guess, we want to maximize information. We need to find the positions of R and E and also discover the other two letters.

We have two known letters: R and E (and N fixed). We can try to place R in one of the allowed positions (1 or 3) and E in one of the allowed positions (1,2,4) but note: if we place both, we must avoid conflict.

Since we know position 5 is N, we can focus on the first four.

What if we try a word that places R at position 1 and E at position 2? That would be ""RE"" in the beginning, and then two letters before N.

Word: ""REIGN"" -> R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). 
  We can test I and G.

But note: what if the word is ""RIPEN""? Then we would have E at position 4. How to distinguish?

We could try a word that tests both possibilities? But we can't test two at once.

Alternatively, we could test R at position 3? That would tell us immediately whether R is at 1 or 3? Because if we guess R at 3 and it appears as ✓, then we know R is at 3. If it's (-), then we know R is not at 3 so it must be at 1.

Similarly for E: we can test E in a specific position.

So let's design a guess that tests either R in position 3 or E in a position where we have uncertainty.

But note: we are limited by the word constraints.

Idea: use a word that puts R in position 3 to test that hypothesis. If R is there, we get ✓. If not, then R must be at 1.

Similarly, we can also test E in position 4? Because E can be in 4.

For example, guess a word that has:
  - R in position 3 (to see if it's correct)
  - E in position 4 (to see if it's correct)
  - And we know N is fixed at 5.

So the last three letters: R E N? Then we need two letters before that.

Word pattern: _ _ R E N

We need to fill the first two letters. And we must avoid forbidden letters: C, A, S, T.

Possible words?
  ""O R E N"" -> ""OREN"" is 4 letters? We need 5: _ _ R E N -> so two letters: [consonant?][vowel?] R E N.

  Examples:
    ""BOREN"" -> not a standard word.
    ""BAREN"" -> has A, forbidden.
    ""WIREN"" -> W-I-R-E-N: W(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), N(5) -> ""wiren"" isn't commonly recognized? But ""wire"" is with N? Not a standard word.

  ""BUREN"" -> not common.

  ""DIREN"" -> not a word.

  ""FIREN"" -> firen? Not valid.

It's difficult. Let's check ""GREEN"" -> but G-R-E-E-N, has E repeated? Also, E at position 3 is forbidden? But we are putting E at 4? But there is also E at position 2? And we don't know if E is repeated? But we haven't been told about repeated letters. However, note that the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates separately. But in the first guess, E was at 5 and we got (-), which means there is at least one E. Similarly, if there were duplicate E, we might not know.

For ""GREEN"": G, R, E, E, N -> 
  Positions: G(1), R(2)? -> but R cannot be at position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2 because of ""crane"". So in this word, R is at position 2? That's illegal.

So we cannot put R at position 2.

Therefore, for the pattern _ _ R E N, we have to put R at position 3, which is allowed? But we don't have position 2 as R? We are putting R at 3.

But the word ""HOREN"" -> not standard.

Perhaps we should avoid this pattern because it's hard to find a common word.

Then, let's go to R at position 1. Then we can try E in position 2 or position 4.

To decide between these two, we can choose a word that places E at position 2 and then try ""REIGN"". If E is really at 2, it will show as ✓. If not, we'll get (-) and then we know E is at 4.

Similarly, if we try ""RIPEN"", we test E at 4.

Both are valid words.

But which one to pick? We can choose one arbitrarily or based on letter frequency.

Let me pick ""REIGN"" because:
- It tests E at position 2, which is a common position.
- It uses G and I, which are common letters.

So:

Pattern: R(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5)

If feedback for E is ✓, then we know E is at position 2. Otherwise, if E is (-) then it is in the word but not in 2, so then it must be at 4 (since the only other possibility for E is 1 or 4, but we have R at 1? Then E cannot be at 1? Wait: position 1 is R? So E can only be at 4? Or we have conflict?

But wait: if E is at position 2 and we guess ""REIGN"", then:
  - If E is indeed at 2: we get E(✓)
  - If E is not at 2 but in the word, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but at a different position.

But what are the possible positions for E? Only 1,2,4? But in our guess, position 1 is R, we assume? But we are putting R at position 1? So E cannot be at position 1? Then E must be at 4? Therefore:

If in ""REIGN"" we get E(-), that would be inconsistent because the only remaining position for E is 4? But we don't have E at 4 in the guess? We have E at 2. So if E is not at 2, then it must be at 4? So we would get E(-) and that implies E is in the word at position 4? But we don't have a letter at position 4? Wait, we have G at position 4.

But to have E(-) in position 2, it means E is in the secret word in a different position. The only possible position we haven't ruled out is position 4? Since position 1 is taken by R? But in the secret word, position 1 could be E? But then R wouldn't be at 1? Wait, we are assuming R is at 1? But actually, we don't know for sure that R is at 1. We are testing R at 1? Yes.

So actually, if we guess ""REIGN"":
- Position 1: R -> if R is at 1, then ✓. If not? Then R is at position 3? But we are putting R at 1. So if we get R(-), then R is in the word but not at 1, so it must be at position 3? 
- Position 2: E -> if E is at 2, ✓; or if E is elsewhere? Then (-) meaning E is not at 2.

Wait, let's break down the possibilities:

Case 1: R is at position 1:
  Then E must be at 2 or 4? Since E cannot be in 3 (ruled out by ""stern"") and not in 5 (ruled out by ""crane""). In the secret word, position 1 is R, so E cannot be at 1? Then E must be at 2 or 4.
  - If E is at 2: then we should get E(✓) for ""REIGN"".
  - If E is at 4: then we get E(-) for position 2? And also, we have I at position 3 and G at 4? Then E is at 4, so G might be something else? So we would get feedback on G and I.

Case 2: R is at position 3:
  Then we cannot have R at position 1? So if R is at 3, in ""REIGN"":
    - R in position 1 would be wrong, so R(x)? But wait no: R is in the word? So it would be R(-) meaning R is present but not at position 1? Then it must be at position 3? 
    And then we get feedback that R is present (and we know it must be at 3? because we haven't tested position 3?).

But actually, we don't know for sure. But we are testing position 1 for R? So:

We can interpret:

If we guess ""REIGN"":

- If R gets ✓: then R is at position 1. And E could be at 2 or 4? 
   Then E at 2: ✓, or at 4: (-)

- If R gets (-): then R is in the word but not at 1, so since we know R must be at 1 or 3, then it must be at position 3? 
  And E: then E at 2? If E is at 2, we could get ✓? Or if E is not at 2? Then we get (-) meaning E is at 4? Because E cannot be at 1 (because we have R at 1? but no: the secret word position 1: not R? Then E can be at position 1? Or at 4? Or at 2? Or ... wait: we have eliminated positions 3 and 5 for E? So only 1,2,4. So E could be at 1? But we are guessing E at 2.

Actually, it's complicated.

Alternatively, we could test the R position explicitly by placing R in position 3 in this guess? That would clarify R's position.

But earlier we didn't find a good word for R at 3? Let's try again to find a word with R at position 3 and E at position 4? That way, if R is at 3, we get ✓ for R? And if E is at 4, we get ✓ for E? And we know position 5 is N? Then we only need to fill the first two letters.

Word pattern: _ _, R, E, N -> two letters, then ""REN"".

So the word is ? ? R E N.

5-letter words ending with ""REN"": 
  Valid words?
  ""BOREN""? Not common.
  ""BAREN"" -> forbidden A.
  ""SIREN"" -> forbidden S.
  ""WIREN"" -> doesn't appear in the dictionary.
  ""KEREN""? Not standard.
  ""DIREN"", ""FIREN"", ""GIREN"", ""HIREN"", ""LIREN"", ""MIREN"" -> not words.

What about ""TREEN""? But T is forbidden? We cannot use T.

""GREEN"" -> but G-R-E-E-N: positions: G(1), R(2)? -> R in position 2 is not allowed. And also, we would have two E's? But we are putting E at position 3 in ""GREEN""? So position 1: G, 2: R (forbidden?), 3: E, 4: E, 5: N? But R at 2 is forbidden -> we know R cannot be at 2. So ""GREEN"" is invalid for guessing because we cannot put R at 2.

Another possibility: ""OAREN""? Not a word.

Maybe ""PUREN"" ... not common.

Perhaps we should use a word with R at 3 but E not necessarily at 4? Like E at 1 or 2.

For example:

Pattern: E _ R _ N -> E at position 1: allowed? because we haven't tested position 1 for E? And if we put E at 1: then the word starts with E and ends with R E N? Not likely.

Word: ""EERIE"" doesn't end with N.

""EEREN"" -> not a word.

Alternatively, pattern: _ E R _ N -> with E at position 2: allowed? and R at 3.

Examples: 
  ""LEARN"" -> but L-E-A-R-N: A is forbidden? No. And also, we are putting A? A is forbidden -> so no.
  ""BER"" pattern: ""YEARN"" -> Y-E-A-R-N: A is forbidden? Yes. 
  ""HEARN""? Not valid.
  ""BEARN"" -> A forbidden.

""PER"" pattern: ""PERON"" -> P-E-R-O-N: E(2), R(3)? But what's the feedback? We are guessing:
  P(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)

This might be a valid word? ""Peron"" as a name? But we need common English words.

Common words: 
  ""HERON"" -> H-E-R-O-N: 
    - E at position 2? allowed? Yes.
    - R at position 3? allowed? Yes.
    - H at 1 and O at 4: new letters.
    - Avoids forbidden letters: H, O are new and not in forbidden list.

But ""HERON"" ends with N. And it has R at 3 and E at 2? This matches.

So ""HERON"": 
  - Position 1: H
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: O
  - Position 5: N

Now, this tests:
  - R at position 3: if it's correct, we get ✓. If it's not correct, then R must be at position 1? 
  - E at position 2: if correct, ✓. If not, then E must be in a different position (1 or 4?).

But note: E can also be at position 4? And position 2 is the only one we are testing here.

Thus, ""HERON"" is a valid word that tests the R position (3) and the E position (2) simultaneously.

Moreover, it introduces two new letters: H and O.

We are using it even though S,T,A,C are absent? Yes, H and O are not forbidden.

Therefore, I propose to guess ""HERON"".

If we get R at 3 as ✓, then we know R's position. If not, we know R is at 1. Similarly, for E.

<guess>heron</guess>With the secret word ending in N (position 5 confirmed) and containing R and E (exact positions unknown), plus two additional unknown letters:  
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, S, T**.  
- **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → only positions 1 or 3 possible.  
- **E** cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, or 4 possible.  

To resolve the position of **R**, I prioritized testing it in position 3 via **""heron""**:  
- **H** (1), **E** (2), **R** (3), **O** (4), **N** (5).  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (if ✓, R is confirmed at position 3; if (-), R must be at position 1).  
- Simultaneously tests **E** in position 2 (if ✓ or (-), it narrows **E**’s position).  
- Introduces **H** and **O** as new common letters.  

This maximizes information on key letter placements while adhering to constraints.

<guess>heron</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
- C and A are absent from the secret word.  
- R, N, and E are present but not in the positions guessed (R not at 2, N not at 4, E not at 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""stern""):**  
- S and T are absent from the secret word.  
- E and R are present but not in the positions guessed (E not at 3, R not at 4).  
- N is present and correctly positioned at 5.  

### Key Conclusions:
- The secret word ends with N (position 5).  
- The secret word contains R and E (exact positions unknown).  
- Letters C, A, S, T are eliminated.  
- R can only be in positions 1 or 3 (ruled out: 2 and 4).  
- E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (ruled out: 3 and 5).  
- Two additional unknown letters need to be discovered.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
To resolve R and E's positions and identify new letters, I selected **""heron""** because:  
- Places **R in position 3** to test the hypothesis that R belongs there. If correct, feedback will show ✓; if not (feedback: - or x), R must be at position 1.  
- Places **E in position 2** to test its possible location.  
- **H and O** are new common letters that haven't been tested.  
- The word avoids eliminated letters (C, A, S, T).  
- It adheres to the constraints for E and R positions.  

This guess maximizes positional information while efficiently narrowing down possibilities.",Guess 3: heron -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
