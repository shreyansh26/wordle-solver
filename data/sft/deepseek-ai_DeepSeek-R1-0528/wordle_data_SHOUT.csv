We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), which are very common in English.

First, the user asked for a new guess, and I have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Since all letters in ""crane"" are incorrect, I need to choose a completely different word for my next guess. I should avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E.

I need a 5-letter English word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, or E. Also, to maximize information, I should pick a word with common letters that weren't in the first guess. Common letters in English include S, T, O, I, L, etc.

Let me think of words without those letters. For example, words with S, T, O, I, L, U, M, P, H, etc.

Possible words: ""spilt"", ""built"", ""mound"", but M and O might be options – ""mound"" has U and N, but N is excluded. N is in the excluded list from feedback.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. So I can't use any of these.

Let me list the alphabet minus these: available letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But Q, J, X, Z are less common, so I should prioritize common letters.

Common consonants: S, T, L, M, P, H, etc. Vowels: O, I, U, Y (as in ""sky"").

A good Wordle strategy is to try another word with high-frequency letters. Since vowels are often important, and A and E are out, I could try words with O, I, U.

For example, ""pious"" – but that has S and U. ""pious"": P, I, O, U, S. None of these are excluded? C,R,A,N,E excluded, so P, I, O, U, S are all possible.

But I should ensure it's a valid word.

Other options: ""audio"" – A is excluded! A is in ""audio"", but A is excluded from feedback. Similarly, ""audio"" has A, which is not allowed.

""pious"" doesn't have any excluded letters: P, I, O, U, S – none are C,R,A,N,E.

S is available; S wasn't in the first guess or excluded.

C,R,A,N,E are excluded, so S could be fine.

But in ""crane"", S wasn't guessed, but since no letters were correct, S might be in the word or not; I don't know.

Another common word: ""stomp"" – S, T, O, M, P. No excluded letters.

Or ""split"" – S, P, L, I, T.

""split"" could be good.

Or ""light"" – L, I, G, H, T.

G and H are less common, but okay.

Perhaps ""south"" – S, O, U, T, H.

That has U and H.

I should choose a word that maximizes new information.

After checking, words like ""sully"" but that might double L, not efficient.

""pilot"" – P, I, L, O, T. All seem allowed.

""pilot"" doesn't contain C,R,A,N,E.

Similarly, ""build"" – B, U, I, L, D.

All possible letters.

But D might be less common; I'm not sure.

Standard Wordle practices often suggest ""salet"" or other, but S,A,A in ""salet"" – A is excluded.

Since A and E are out, vowels like I, O, U are important.

Let me pick ""split"": S, P, L, I, T. All common letters.

Or ""point"": P, O, I, N, T – N is excluded! T is fine, but N is in excluded list (from ""crane"" N(x), so N not in word).

In feedback, N(x) means N is not in the word, so I can't use N.

Similarly, ""point"" has N, which is excluded.

""split"" is S,P,L,I,T – no N,A,E,C,R.

L and I are vowels, or I is a vowel.

T is a common consonant.

S and P also common.

I think ""split"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""stole"" – but E is excluded, and O,L okay, but E not allowed.

E not allowed.

""mould"" – M,O,U,L,D, but U and D; D might be okay.

But ""split"" seems fine.

Or ""ghoul"" – G,H,O,U,L – less common.

""found"" has O,U,N,D – N excluded.

N is excluded.

So avoid N.

""What about ""quilt"" – Q is not common, and U,I,L,T okay but Q might be risky.

Better to use common letters.

Inspired by no E,A, I can use O,U,I,Y.

For example, ""lousy"" – L,O,U,S,Y.

Y is sometimes used as vowel.

Or ""mousy"" similar.

""pious"" as I thought earlier.

""pious"" has U,O,I,P,S.

All possible.

I can choose ""pious"" or ""split"".

Perhaps ""ocean"" but C and N excluded; not possible.

C is excluded.

So ""split"" seems solid.

Let's confirm the word: ""split"" is a valid English word.

Yes.

My second guess will be ""split"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" which resulted in all letters being incorrect (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), it means the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, I need to choose a valid 5-letter English word that avoids these excluded letters to maximize new information.

- Since no letters matched, the secret word must consist entirely of letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
- To cover common letters efficiently, I should prioritize high-frequency consonants like S, T, L, M, P, and vowels like O, I, U, as A and E are unavailable.
- After evaluating options such as ""point"" (excluded N), ""audio"" (excluded A), and ""stole"" (excluded E), a good candidate is ""split"" because:
  - It contains S, P, L, I, T—all common letters not in the excluded set.
  - S, T, and L are among the most frequent consonants in English, and I is a common vowel, potentially revealing key positions.
  - This guess avoids repeated letters and minimizes overlap with the first guess, ensuring a high chance of new feedback.

This guess should help identify available letters and their positions in the secret word.

I should avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E.\n\nI need a 5-letter English word that doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N, or E. Also, to maximize information, I should pick a word with common letters that weren\'t in the first guess. Common letters in English include S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nLet me think of words without those letters. For example, words with S, T, O, I, L, U, M, P, H, etc.\n\nPossible words: ""spilt"", ""built"", ""mound"", but M and O might be options – ""mound"" has U and N, but N is excluded.

All common letters.\n\nOr ""point"": P, O, I, N, T – N is excluded! T is fine, but N is in excluded list (from ""crane"" N(x), so N not in word).\n\nIn feedback, N(x) means N is not in the word, so I can\'t use N.\n\nSimilarly, ""point"" has N, which is excluded.\n\n""split"" is S,P,L,I,T – no N,A,E,C,R.\n\nL and I are vowels, or I is a vowel.\n\nT is a common consonant.\n\nS and P also common.\n\nI think ""split"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother option: ""stole"" – but E is excluded, and O,L okay, but E not allowed.\n\nE not allowed.\n\n""mould"" – M,O,U,L,D, but U and D; D might be okay.\n\nBut ""split"" seems fine.\n\nOr ""ghoul"" – G,H,O,U,L – less common.\n\n""found"" has O,U,N,D – N excluded.\n\nN is excluded.\n\nSo avoid N.\n\n""What about ""quilt"" – Q is not common, and U,I,L,T okay but Q might be risky.\n\nBetter to use common letters.\n\nInspired by no E,A, I can use O,U,I,Y.\n\nFor example, ""lousy"" – L,O,U,S,Y.\n\nY is sometimes used as vowel.\n\nOr ""mousy"" similar.\n\n""pious"" as I thought earlier.\n\n""pious"" has U,O,I,P,S.\n\nAll possible.\n\nI can choose ""pious"" or ""split"".\n\nPerhaps ""ocean"" but C and N excluded; not possible.\n\nC is excluded.\n\nSo ""split"" seems solid.\n\nLet\'s confirm the word: ""split"" is a valid English word.\n\nYes.\n\nMy second guess will be ""split"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" which resulted in all letters being incorrect (C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), it means the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.

First, I have the feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So, none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
- Guess 2: split -> S(✓), P(x), L(x), I(x), T(✓). This means:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, since it's the first letter).
  - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since it's the fifth letter).
  - P, L, I are not in the word at all, because if they were in the word but in the wrong position, it would be marked with (-), but here it's (x), so they are absent.

From Guess 2: S(✓) confirms that S is the first letter of the secret word, and T(✓) confirms that T is the fifth letter. Also, P(x), L(x), I(x) mean that P, L, and I are not in the secret word.

Combining that with Guess 1, where C, R, A, N, E are not in the word, and now P, L, I are also not in the word. So, excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.

Therefore, possible letters for the secret word are from the alphabet excluding these. Alphabet minus excluded letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since S and T are already in the word in positions 1 and 5, I don't need to worry about those for inclusion, only for the middle positions.

The secret word has this pattern: S _ _ _ T

Since S is first, T is fifth, and all other letters in positions 2,3,4 are unknown but from the remaining possible letters.

Excluded letters summary: C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I are not in the word at all.

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (S and T are already used, but since they are in the word, S and T could technically be elsewhere, but in this case, S is confirmed in position 1, T in position 5, so for positions 2,3,4, I need letters not S or T? No, position 1 is S, position 5 is T, so positions 2,3,4 could theoretically have S or T, but if S were in position 2, for example, it might be marked differently. But from feedback, in ""split"", S was ✓ in position 1, but it doesn't say anything about other positions. However, since the feedback only marked S correct in position 1, it implies that there aren't multiple S's? Not necessarily—Wordle feedback shows if there are duplicate letters, but I need to recall the rules.

The feedback shows:
- ✓ for correct position.
- - for correct letter wrong position.
- x for not in word.

If a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it based on the secret word. For example, if the secret word has two S's, and I guess one S in correct position and another in wrong position, it might show ✓ and - or something.

But in this case, for ""split"", S(✓) is for position 1, and since it's a check, it means that S is correct in that position, but it doesn't preclude another S in the word. Specifically, the x for other letters might not indicate that S isn't elsewhere.

From feedback: S(✓) means S is in position 1. If there were another S in the secret word, and I didn't guess it, it wouldn't show in this feedback since I didn't put S elsewhere. In ""split"", S is only in position 1, so if there were another S, it wouldn't be reflected because I didn't guess that position. Similarly for T.

In this feedback for ""split"", positions 2,3,4 are P,L,I all marked (x), which means that P, L, I are not in the word at all, but for S and T, they are present and correct.

But S could be present elsewhere? For S: it's marked ✓ in position 1, which confirms at least one S in position 1. If there were a second S in the word, I didn't guess it, so the feedback wouldn't indicate it's missing or anything; it would just be undiscovered.

Similarly for T, it's only in position 5, so if there's another T, I don't know.

But in typical Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, for now, I should assume that S and T might not be duplicated, but I should check possibilities.

First, let's list knowns:
- Position 1: S
- Position 5: T
- Positions 2,3,4: need letters not from C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I and also not conflicting.

The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need to form a valid English word that starts with S and ends with T, with three letters in the middle from the available set.

Possible words: like ""sight"", but ""sight"" has G and H, which are available, and I is excluded? ""sight"" is S,I,G,H,T.

But I is excluded because from feedback, in guess 2, I(x) means I is not in the word. So ""sight"" has I, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""shunt"" has S,H,U,N,T – but N is excluded, from guess 1 N(x).

N is out.

Examples of S _ _ _ T words:

- ""slept"": S,L,E,P,T – but L is excluded (L(x) from guess 2), E excluded, P excluded.

Not good.

""smelt"": similar, M,E,L,T – E and L excluded.

""start"": S,T,A,R,T – but A excluded, R excluded, and also has T at position 2 and 5? ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T so positions:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-R,5-T.

But A excluded, R excluded.

Even if not, it has duplicate T.

Possible words without excluded letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common S _ _ _ T words: 

- ""shift"": S,H,I,F,T – but I is excluded. I cannot be used.

- ""shout"": S,H,O,U,T – H,O,U,T all should be available? H is available, O available, U available, T is at end.

Is T available for other positions? Position 5 is T, but for position 2,3,4, I can use letters including T? But T is already used at position 5, but it can be elsewhere if duplicated.

But in this case, ""shout"" is S,H,O,U,T so letters: S,H,O,U,T – all different? S,H,O,U,T: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

Now, letters used: H,O,U – all from available set? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, H, O, U are included.

No excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I are excluded, and H,O,U not in that.

T is at end, S at start, fine.

Is ""shout"" a valid word? Yes.

Another one: ""scent"" but C excluded, E excluded.

""stint"" has T,I,N – I and N excluded.

""stunt"" S,T,U,N,T – N excluded.

""shaft"" S,H,A,F,T – A excluded.

""soot"" is 4 letters, not 5.

S _ _ _ T: ""sault"" – but ""sault"" might be obscure; usually ""fault"" but not S-starting.

Better to think of common words.

""sight"" but I excluded.

""might"" has M,I,G,H,T – I excluded.

Without I, possible words.

""mouth"" S? No, M,O,U,T,H – not S-starting.

S-words: ""scrut"" not a word.

""strut"" S,T,R,U,T – R excluded, and T duplicate, but R not allowed.

""skirt"" S,K,I,R,T – I and R excluded.

""shirt"" similar.

""smelt"" has E,L.

We need no E,L,I,P etc.

So: letters for positions 2,3,4 must be from B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, possible words: 

- ""shout"" : S,H,O,U,T

- ""shunt"" but N excluded.

- ""shaft"" A excluded.

- ""shift"" I excluded.

Another: ""smut"" not 5 letters, ""smote"" S,M,O,T,E but E excluded and T at position 4? But E at end excluded.

""smith"" S,M,I,T,H – I excluded.

""sooth"" S,O,O,T,H – has duplicate O.

""sooth"" is a word, meaning flattery or something, but common? In Wordle, valid words.

But let's list: available middle letters.

Perhaps ""south"" : S,O,U,T,H – but T is at position 4? ""south"" is S,O,U,T,H so positions:1S,2O,3U,4T,5H – but we need position 5 to be T! Oh no.

I need position 5 to be T, so it must end with T.

All words must be S _ _ _ T.

So third last letter is _, fourth is _, fifth T.

So pattern: S ? ? ? T

For ""south"", it ends with H, not T.

Words ending with T: like ""sight"", ""fight"", ""light"", ""might"", ""night"", ""right"", ""tight"", etc. But most have I, which is excluded.

""night"" : N,I,G,H,T – N excluded, I excluded.

""might"" : M,I,G,H,T – I excluded.

Is there any common word ending with T without I,A,E,etc?

For example, ""doubt"" but starts with D.

S-words: ""expert"" not S.

""asset"" but A and E excluded.

""event"" E excluded.

How about ""sweat"" : S,W,E,A,T – E and A excluded.

""comet"" not S.

""salut"" not English.

Another possibility: ""ghest"" not word.

Perhaps less common: ""habit"" but not S.

S-specific: ""spurt"" S,P,U,R,T – P excluded, R excluded.

P is excluded because from guess 2 P(x).

Lets think carefully.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And word: S ? ? ? T

Possible options:

- With U: ""stunt"" but N excluded.

""strut"" R excluded.

""scout"" C excluded.

""shout"" I have: S,H,O,U,T – but position: S1,H2,O3,U4,T5? No: S,H,O,U,T would be like below:

Position: 1-S, 2-H, 3-O, 4-U, 5-T

Yes, ""shout"" ends with T? S-H-O-U-T, yes, shout ends with T.

""Shout"": S (position 1), H (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). Yes, T is position 5.

So ""shout"" is a candidate: letters S,H,O,U,T. H,O,U are available, S and T known.

No excluded letters in it.

Another word: ""shoed"" but ends with D, not T.

""stand"" N and A excluded.

""sound"" N,D excluded? D is available, but ""sound"" ends with D, not T.

""Sound"" is S,O,U,N,D not T-end.

For T-end: ""mount"" M,O,U,N,T – N excluded.

""count"" C excluded.

""point"" P and N excluded? P excluded.

""Fight"" not S-start.

With G: ""sight"" I excluded.

""right"" not S.

With M: ""smith"" I excluded.

""smelt"" E,L excluded.

""swelt"" not common, E excluded.

With B: ""debut"" not S.

""sabat"" not English.

    ""abbot"" not S.

Perhaps ""shoot"": S,H,O,O,T – ends with T. ""Shoot"" is S,H,O,O,T.

Positions: S1, H2, O3, O4, T5.

Letters: S,H,O,O,T. O is duplicated.

But H and O available.

Is O allowed? Yes.

But duplicated.

Similarly, ""spoot"" not word.

""scout"" C excluded.

""snout"" N excluded.

""stout"": S,T,O,U,T—has two Ts. S1, T2, O3, U4, T5.

Position 2 is T, but in secret word, position 5 is T, so position 2 could be another T if doubled.

And S and O,U available.

Letters: S,T,O,U,T — T is used, but at position 2 and 5.

From available, O and U okay.

But T is at position 2? In this guess, I need to consider.

But for feedback, in previous, position 1 S and position 5 T are fixed, so in secret word, it might have another T.

Similarly, in guess 2, T was ✓ in position 5, but not guessed elsewhere, so it might be duplicated.

Now, ""stout"" has T at position 2 and 5, so S-T-O-U-T.

But position 5 T is correct, but position 2 T might be correct or not.

For now, back to available for guess 3.

""about"" not S.

Another word: ""ghost"" not starts with G.

S-: ""shirt"" I,R excluded.

Perhaps ""shaft"" A excluded.

So possible words are limited.

""shout"" as I thought, or ""shoot"" with double O, or ""stout"" with double T.

Or ""sweet"" but E excluded.

E not available.

""suite"" but E excluded and U,I—I excluded? ""Suite"" is S,U,I,T,E — has I and E excluded.

Not good.

""acute"" not S.

So for S _ _ _ T, with middle from available.

Let me list possible combinations.

Position 2: could be B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Position 3: same

Position 4: same

But they need to form a word.

For example:
- If H in position 2, then SH?T words: like ""shout"" if O position 3, U position 4.

""shoot"" H position 2, O position 3, O position 4.

""shift"" but F for position 4? ""shift"" S,H,I,F,T — position 3 I excluded.

Not.

""shalt"" A,L excluded.

Or M in position 2: ""smelt"" E,L excluded.

""smite"" I,E excluded.

""smoot"" not word.

O in position 2: ""south"" ends with H.

""soot"" short.

U in position 2: ""usher"" not starts with S.

S must be first.

Position 2 U: ""suits"" ends with S, not T. ""Suit"" is 4 letters.

""suite"" S,U,I,T,E but E excluded.

G in position 2: ""sight"" I excluded.

""grate"" not S.

So ""shout"" seems valid: S,H,O,U,T

Similarly, ""shoot"": S,H,O,O,T

""stout"": S,T,O,U,T but position 2 is T.

Another one: ""scout"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""squit"" not English.

I think ""shout"" or ""shoot"" or ""stout"" are candidates.

But for ""stout"", since T is at position 5, if I put T at position 2, it might be correct or not, but I might get information.

Similarly, in terms of maximizing information, since I know S and T positions, I want to guess letters that cover more possible vowels or common consonants.

Available vowels now: O,U,Y? Vowels are A,E,I,O,U and sometimes Y.

But A,E,I are excluded, so only O,U, and Y possible.

In available letters: O,U,Y are possible vowels.

Consonants like B,D,F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Z, etc.

In ""shout"", I get H,O,U tested.

H is common, O and U vowels.

In ""shoot"", H,O,O, I get H and O, but O duplicated, less information.

In ""stout"", S,T,O,U,T, I get T tested at position 2 (but I already know T is in the word, but I don't know about position 2 yet), and O,U.

T might be duplicated or not.

Since S and T are fixed, I should guess letters that might be in the middle to get positions.

Also, from feedback, in guess 2, P,L,I were wrong, so I avoid them.

So for the next guess, I need to choose a word like S ? ? ? T.

I think ""shout"" is a good choice because it covers H,O,U which are new and common.

If I get feedback, it will tell me about H,O,U.

Similarly, ""smut"" not.

Another word: ""about"" not S.

""skint"" but K,I,N,T — I and N excluded.

Not.

I might consider letters that can be in multiple positions.

But since positions 2,3,4 are unknown, ""shout"" seems fine.

Similarly, is ""yacht"" but Y,A,C — A excluded, C excluded, not S start.

So ""shout"" is a valid guess.

Confirmation: secret word has S first and T fifth, and from feedback, no C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I.

So ""shout"" has S,H,O,U,T — H,O,U not excluded.

Assume ""shout"" is good.

Yes.

So my guess will be ""shout"".

In the thought process, I should reason.

Another possibility: ""doubt"" not S.

Or ""paint"" not S.

So I'll go with ""shout"".
</think>
### Thought Process
- **Previous Feedback Analysis:**
  - Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the secret word), so these letters are excluded.
  - Guess 2 (""split"") had feedback: S(✓) at position 1, P(x) not in word, L(x) not in word, I(x) not in word, T(✓) at position 5. This means:
    - S is correct in position 1.
    - T is correct in position 5.
    - P, L, and I are not in the secret word and are now excluded.
  - Combined excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.
  
- **Current Knowledge:**
  - Secret word format: S _ _ _ T (since position 1 is S and position 5 is T).
  - Available letters for positions 2, 3, and 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters except the excluded ones and confirmed S/T positions).
  - Goal: Guess a valid 5-letter English word that fits S _ _ _ T and uses only available letters to test new information.

- **Word Selection:**
  - Possible words include ""shout"" (S,H,O,U,T), ""shoot"" (S,H,O,O,T), and ""stout"" (S,T,O,U,T).
  - Choosing ""shout"" because:
    - It introduces three new letters (H, O, U), which are common and efficient for gaining feedback.
    - H, O, and U are vowels or consonants that can reveal positions effectively.
    - It avoids duplicate letters and overlaps with previous guesses.
    - Among options, ""shout"" is a highly common word, minimizing obscurity.
  - If ""shout"" is incorrect, feedback on H, O, and U will help refine possibilities (e.g., if H, O, or U are in the word and in what position).

<guess>shout</guess>",shout,"First, I have the feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So, none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
- Guess 2: split -> S(✓), P(x), L(x), I(x), T(✓). This means:
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1, since it's the first letter).
  - T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since it's the fifth letter).
  - P, L, I are not in the word at all, because if they were in the word but in the wrong position, it would be marked with (-), but here it's (x), so they are absent.

From Guess 2: S(✓) confirms that S is the first letter of the secret word, and T(✓) confirms that T is the fifth letter. Also, P(x), L(x), I(x) mean that P, L, and I are not in the secret word.

Combining that with Guess 1, where C, R, A, N, E are not in the word, and now P, L, I are also not in the word. So, excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.

Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.

Therefore, possible letters for the secret word are from the alphabet excluding these. Alphabet minus excluded letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since S and T are already in the word in positions 1 and 5, I don't need to worry about those for inclusion, only for the middle positions.

The secret word has this pattern: S _ _ _ T

Since S is first, T is fifth, and all other letters in positions 2,3,4 are unknown but from the remaining possible letters.

Excluded letters summary: C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I are not in the word at all.

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (S and T are already used, but since they are in the word, S and T could technically be elsewhere, but in this case, S is confirmed in position 1, T in position 5, so for positions 2,3,4, I need letters not S or T? No, position 1 is S, position 5 is T, so positions 2,3,4 could theoretically have S or T, but if S were in position 2, for example, it might be marked differently. But from feedback, in ""split"", S was ✓ in position 1, but it doesn't say anything about other positions. However, since the feedback only marked S correct in position 1, it implies that there aren't multiple S's? Not necessarily—Wordle feedback shows if there are duplicate letters, but I need to recall the rules.

The feedback shows:
- ✓ for correct position.
- - for correct letter wrong position.
- x for not in word.

If a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it based on the secret word. For example, if the secret word has two S's, and I guess one S in correct position and another in wrong position, it might show ✓ and - or something.

But in this case, for ""split"", S(✓) is for position 1, and since it's a check, it means that S is correct in that position, but it doesn't preclude another S in the word. Specifically, the x for other letters might not indicate that S isn't elsewhere.

From feedback: S(✓) means S is in position 1. If there were another S in the secret word, and I didn't guess it, it wouldn't show in this feedback since I didn't put S elsewhere. In ""split"", S is only in position 1, so if there were another S, it wouldn't be reflected because I didn't guess that position. Similarly for T.

In this feedback for ""split"", positions 2,3,4 are P,L,I all marked (x), which means that P, L, I are not in the word at all, but for S and T, they are present and correct.

But S could be present elsewhere? For S: it's marked ✓ in position 1, which confirms at least one S in position 1. If there were a second S in the word, I didn't guess it, so the feedback wouldn't indicate it's missing or anything; it would just be undiscovered.

Similarly for T, it's only in position 5, so if there's another T, I don't know.

But in typical Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, for now, I should assume that S and T might not be duplicated, but I should check possibilities.

First, let's list knowns:
- Position 1: S
- Position 5: T
- Positions 2,3,4: need letters not from C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I and also not conflicting.

The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need to form a valid English word that starts with S and ends with T, with three letters in the middle from the available set.

Possible words: like ""sight"", but ""sight"" has G and H, which are available, and I is excluded? ""sight"" is S,I,G,H,T.

But I is excluded because from feedback, in guess 2, I(x) means I is not in the word. So ""sight"" has I, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""shunt"" has S,H,U,N,T – but N is excluded, from guess 1 N(x).

N is out.

Examples of S _ _ _ T words:

- ""slept"": S,L,E,P,T – but L is excluded (L(x) from guess 2), E excluded, P excluded.

Not good.

""smelt"": similar, M,E,L,T – E and L excluded.

""start"": S,T,A,R,T – but A excluded, R excluded, and also has T at position 2 and 5? ""start"" is S,T,A,R,T so positions:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-R,5-T.

But A excluded, R excluded.

Even if not, it has duplicate T.

Possible words without excluded letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common S _ _ _ T words: 

- ""shift"": S,H,I,F,T – but I is excluded. I cannot be used.

- ""shout"": S,H,O,U,T – H,O,U,T all should be available? H is available, O available, U available, T is at end.

Is T available for other positions? Position 5 is T, but for position 2,3,4, I can use letters including T? But T is already used at position 5, but it can be elsewhere if duplicated.

But in this case, ""shout"" is S,H,O,U,T so letters: S,H,O,U,T – all different? S,H,O,U,T: S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.

Now, letters used: H,O,U – all from available set? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, H, O, U are included.

No excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I are excluded, and H,O,U not in that.

T is at end, S at start, fine.

Is ""shout"" a valid word? Yes.

Another one: ""scent"" but C excluded, E excluded.

""stint"" has T,I,N – I and N excluded.

""stunt"" S,T,U,N,T – N excluded.

""shaft"" S,H,A,F,T – A excluded.

""soot"" is 4 letters, not 5.

S _ _ _ T: ""sault"" – but ""sault"" might be obscure; usually ""fault"" but not S-starting.

Better to think of common words.

""sight"" but I excluded.

""might"" has M,I,G,H,T – I excluded.

Without I, possible words.

""mouth"" S? No, M,O,U,T,H – not S-starting.

S-words: ""scrut"" not a word.

""strut"" S,T,R,U,T – R excluded, and T duplicate, but R not allowed.

""skirt"" S,K,I,R,T – I and R excluded.

""shirt"" similar.

""smelt"" has E,L.

We need no E,L,I,P etc.

So: letters for positions 2,3,4 must be from B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, possible words: 

- ""shout"" : S,H,O,U,T

- ""shunt"" but N excluded.

- ""shaft"" A excluded.

- ""shift"" I excluded.

Another: ""smut"" not 5 letters, ""smote"" S,M,O,T,E but E excluded and T at position 4? But E at end excluded.

""smith"" S,M,I,T,H – I excluded.

""sooth"" S,O,O,T,H – has duplicate O.

""sooth"" is a word, meaning flattery or something, but common? In Wordle, valid words.

But let's list: available middle letters.

Perhaps ""south"" : S,O,U,T,H – but T is at position 4? ""south"" is S,O,U,T,H so positions:1S,2O,3U,4T,5H – but we need position 5 to be T! Oh no.

I need position 5 to be T, so it must end with T.

All words must be S _ _ _ T.

So third last letter is _, fourth is _, fifth T.

So pattern: S ? ? ? T

For ""south"", it ends with H, not T.

Words ending with T: like ""sight"", ""fight"", ""light"", ""might"", ""night"", ""right"", ""tight"", etc. But most have I, which is excluded.

""night"" : N,I,G,H,T – N excluded, I excluded.

""might"" : M,I,G,H,T – I excluded.

Is there any common word ending with T without I,A,E,etc?

For example, ""doubt"" but starts with D.

S-words: ""expert"" not S.

""asset"" but A and E excluded.

""event"" E excluded.

How about ""sweat"" : S,W,E,A,T – E and A excluded.

""comet"" not S.

""salut"" not English.

Another possibility: ""ghest"" not word.

Perhaps less common: ""habit"" but not S.

S-specific: ""spurt"" S,P,U,R,T – P excluded, R excluded.

P is excluded because from guess 2 P(x).

Lets think carefully.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And word: S ? ? ? T

Possible options:

- With U: ""stunt"" but N excluded.

""strut"" R excluded.

""scout"" C excluded.

""shout"" I have: S,H,O,U,T – but position: S1,H2,O3,U4,T5? No: S,H,O,U,T would be like below:

Position: 1-S, 2-H, 3-O, 4-U, 5-T

Yes, ""shout"" ends with T? S-H-O-U-T, yes, shout ends with T.

""Shout"": S (position 1), H (2), O (3), U (4), T (5). Yes, T is position 5.

So ""shout"" is a candidate: letters S,H,O,U,T. H,O,U are available, S and T known.

No excluded letters in it.

Another word: ""shoed"" but ends with D, not T.

""stand"" N and A excluded.

""sound"" N,D excluded? D is available, but ""sound"" ends with D, not T.

""Sound"" is S,O,U,N,D not T-end.

For T-end: ""mount"" M,O,U,N,T – N excluded.

""count"" C excluded.

""point"" P and N excluded? P excluded.

""Fight"" not S-start.

With G: ""sight"" I excluded.

""right"" not S.

With M: ""smith"" I excluded.

""smelt"" E,L excluded.

""swelt"" not common, E excluded.

With B: ""debut"" not S.

""sabat"" not English.

    ""abbot"" not S.

Perhaps ""shoot"": S,H,O,O,T – ends with T. ""Shoot"" is S,H,O,O,T.

Positions: S1, H2, O3, O4, T5.

Letters: S,H,O,O,T. O is duplicated.

But H and O available.

Is O allowed? Yes.

But duplicated.

Similarly, ""spoot"" not word.

""scout"" C excluded.

""snout"" N excluded.

""stout"": S,T,O,U,T—has two Ts. S1, T2, O3, U4, T5.

Position 2 is T, but in secret word, position 5 is T, so position 2 could be another T if doubled.

And S and O,U available.

Letters: S,T,O,U,T — T is used, but at position 2 and 5.

From available, O and U okay.

But T is at position 2? In this guess, I need to consider.

But for feedback, in previous, position 1 S and position 5 T are fixed, so in secret word, it might have another T.

Similarly, in guess 2, T was ✓ in position 5, but not guessed elsewhere, so it might be duplicated.

Now, ""stout"" has T at position 2 and 5, so S-T-O-U-T.

But position 5 T is correct, but position 2 T might be correct or not.

For now, back to available for guess 3.

""about"" not S.

Another word: ""ghost"" not starts with G.

S-: ""shirt"" I,R excluded.

Perhaps ""shaft"" A excluded.

So possible words are limited.

""shout"" as I thought, or ""shoot"" with double O, or ""stout"" with double T.

Or ""sweet"" but E excluded.

E not available.

""suite"" but E excluded and U,I—I excluded? ""Suite"" is S,U,I,T,E — has I and E excluded.

Not good.

""acute"" not S.

So for S _ _ _ T, with middle from available.

Let me list possible combinations.

Position 2: could be B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Position 3: same

Position 4: same

But they need to form a word.

For example:
- If H in position 2, then SH?T words: like ""shout"" if O position 3, U position 4.

""shoot"" H position 2, O position 3, O position 4.

""shift"" but F for position 4? ""shift"" S,H,I,F,T — position 3 I excluded.

Not.

""shalt"" A,L excluded.

Or M in position 2: ""smelt"" E,L excluded.

""smite"" I,E excluded.

""smoot"" not word.

O in position 2: ""south"" ends with H.

""soot"" short.

U in position 2: ""usher"" not starts with S.

S must be first.

Position 2 U: ""suits"" ends with S, not T. ""Suit"" is 4 letters.

""suite"" S,U,I,T,E but E excluded.

G in position 2: ""sight"" I excluded.

""grate"" not S.

So ""shout"" seems valid: S,H,O,U,T

Similarly, ""shoot"": S,H,O,O,T

""stout"": S,T,O,U,T but position 2 is T.

Another one: ""scout"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""squit"" not English.

I think ""shout"" or ""shoot"" or ""stout"" are candidates.

But for ""stout"", since T is at position 5, if I put T at position 2, it might be correct or not, but I might get information.

Similarly, in terms of maximizing information, since I know S and T positions, I want to guess letters that cover more possible vowels or common consonants.

Available vowels now: O,U,Y? Vowels are A,E,I,O,U and sometimes Y.

But A,E,I are excluded, so only O,U, and Y possible.

In available letters: O,U,Y are possible vowels.

Consonants like B,D,F,G,H,K,M,V,W,X,Z, etc.

In ""shout"", I get H,O,U tested.

H is common, O and U vowels.

In ""shoot"", H,O,O, I get H and O, but O duplicated, less information.

In ""stout"", S,T,O,U,T, I get T tested at position 2 (but I already know T is in the word, but I don't know about position 2 yet), and O,U.

T might be duplicated or not.

Since S and T are fixed, I should guess letters that might be in the middle to get positions.

Also, from feedback, in guess 2, P,L,I were wrong, so I avoid them.

So for the next guess, I need to choose a word like S ? ? ? T.

I think ""shout"" is a good choice because it covers H,O,U which are new and common.

If I get feedback, it will tell me about H,O,U.

Similarly, ""smut"" not.

Another word: ""about"" not S.

""skint"" but K,I,N,T — I and N excluded.

Not.

I might consider letters that can be in multiple positions.

But since positions 2,3,4 are unknown, ""shout"" seems fine.

Similarly, is ""yacht"" but Y,A,C — A excluded, C excluded, not S start.

So ""shout"" is a valid guess.

Confirmation: secret word has S first and T fifth, and from feedback, no C,R,A,N,E,P,L,I.

So ""shout"" has S,H,O,U,T — H,O,U not excluded.

Assume ""shout"" is good.

Yes.

So my guess will be ""shout"".

In the thought process, I should reason.

Another possibility: ""doubt"" not S.

Or ""paint"" not S.

So I'll go with ""shout"".### Thought Process
- **Previous Feedback Analysis:**
  - Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the secret word), so these letters are excluded.
  - Guess 2 (""split"") had feedback: S(✓) at position 1, P(x) not in word, L(x) not in word, I(x) not in word, T(✓) at position 5. This means:
    - S is correct in position 1.
    - T is correct in position 5.
    - P, L, and I are not in the secret word and are now excluded.
  - Combined excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, I.
  
- **Current Knowledge:**
  - Secret word format: S _ _ _ T (since position 1 is S and position 5 is T).
  - Available letters for positions 2, 3, and 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (all letters except the excluded ones and confirmed S/T positions).
  - Goal: Guess a valid 5-letter English word that fits S _ _ _ T and uses only available letters to test new information.

- **Word Selection:**
  - Possible words include ""shout"" (S,H,O,U,T), ""shoot"" (S,H,O,O,T), and ""stout"" (S,T,O,U,T).
  - Choosing ""shout"" because:
    - It introduces three new letters (H, O, U), which are common and efficient for gaining feedback.
    - H, O, and U are vowels or consonants that can reveal positions effectively.
    - It avoids duplicate letters and overlaps with previous guesses.
    - Among options, ""shout"" is a highly common word, minimizing obscurity.
  - If ""shout"" is incorrect, feedback on H, O, and U will help refine possibilities (e.g., if H, O, or U are in the word and in what position).",Guess 3: shout -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) U(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
