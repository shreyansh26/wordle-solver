We are just starting the game. We have no information yet.
 A good starting guess should have a variety of unique letters and include common vowels and consonants.
 Often, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc., are chosen because they contain common letters.
 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English words.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good candidate: it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common.

 However, note that the feedback we receive will be critical for subsequent guesses.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 But let me confirm: we need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""CRANE"" is valid.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

For the first guess, I need a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word should include frequent vowels and consonants without repeating letters. ""CRANE"" fits well because it has five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This guess will provide clear feedback on multiple letter positions.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can use other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels: We have used A and E, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: We have used C, R, N, so we have many left such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""PIOUS"" -> uses P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels, and S is a common consonant.
   ""STOMP"" -> uses S, T, O, M, P. This covers several common consonants and one vowel.

 However, note that we have not used the letter T yet, which is very common.

 Another option: ""SLIPT"" or ""SPLIT"", but we need to avoid the excluded letters. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of these are in the excluded set.

 But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""SPLIT"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. However, O and U are vowels, and we might want to test more common letters.

 Considering frequency of letters in English words, the most common letters left are: S, T, L, O, P, M, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). But note that we have already excluded A and E, so we are safe.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's list some candidate words without those letters:

   - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T
   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T
   - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> but we have U and B, and we might want to avoid less common letters? However, B and D are common.
   - ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded, so invalid.

 Another idea: ""SHOWY"" (S, H, O, W, Y) but Y is sometimes a vowel and less common.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 Since we have no information, we should choose a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 The most common letters in English (after E, A, R, which we have already tried and excluded) are: O, I, S, T, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, S, T, L, etc.

 We have excluded: A, C, E, N, R.

 So the top remaining letters: O, I, S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.

 Therefore, a good candidate is ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"".

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it uses S, P, L, I, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these, but we are trying to cover ground.

 Alternatively, we can use ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). However, ""PILOT"" has O and T, which are common.

 I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there are any other words that might cover more of the top letters.

 The top 10 letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D. 
 We have excluded A, E, N, R. So the top remaining are T, O, I, S, H, D.

 So we might want to include T, O, I, S, and H or D.

 A word that includes T, O, I, S, and H? How about ""HOIST"" (H, O, I, S, T). That covers T, O, I, S, and H.

 Similarly, ""SHOOT"" is not good because it repeats O.

 ""HOIST"" is a valid word and covers five distinct letters: H, O, I, S, T.

 This covers the top remaining letters: T (2nd), O (4th), I (5th), S (7th), H (8th). 

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" uses M (which is 11th) instead of H (8th). So ""HOIST"" might be slightly better.

 But note: we are not sure about the frequency in 5-letter words, but generally, it's similar.

 I think ""HOIST"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T. None of these are excluded.

 So I will go with ""HOIST"".

 But let me confirm: is ""HOIST"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""HOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that avoids these excluded letters and tests new common letters like T, O, I, S, and H to gather more information. ""HOIST"" fits this criteria, as it uses high-frequency letters not yet tested and is a valid 5-letter word.

We can use other vowels and consonants.\n\n Vowels: We have used A and E, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).\n Consonants: We have used C, R, N, so we have many left such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word without the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n\n Example words: \n   ""PIOUS"" -> uses P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels, and S is a common consonant.\n   ""STOMP"" -> uses S, T, O, M, P. This covers several common consonants and one vowel.\n\n However, note that we have not used the letter T yet, which is very common.\n\n Another option: ""SLIPT"" or ""SPLIT"", but we need to avoid the excluded letters. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of these are in the excluded set.\n\n But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""SPLIT"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. However, O and U are vowels, and we might want to test more common letters.\n\n Considering frequency of letters in English words, the most common letters left are: S, T, L, O, P, M, D, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). But note that we have already excluded A and E, so we are safe.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s list some candidate words without those letters:\n\n   - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T\n   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T\n   - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> but we have U and B, and we might want to avoid less common letters? However, B and D are common.\n   - ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded, so invalid.\n\n Another idea: ""SHOWY"" (S, H, O, W, Y) but Y is sometimes a vowel and less common.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n Since we have no information, we should choose a word with high-frequency letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n The most common letters in English (after E, A, R, which we have already tried and excluded) are: O, I, S, T, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, S, T, L, etc.\n\n We have excluded: A, C, E, N, R.\n\n So the top remaining letters: O, I, S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.\n\n Therefore, a good candidate is ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"".\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it uses S, P, L, I, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these, but we are trying to cover ground.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). However, ""PILOT"" has O and T, which are common.\n\n I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.\n\n However, let me check if there are any other words that might cover more of the top letters.\n\n The top 10 letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D. \n We have excluded A, E, N, R. So the top remaining are T, O, I, S, H, D.\n\n So we might want to include T, O, I, S, and H or D.\n\n A word that includes T, O, I, S, and H? How about ""HOIST"" (H, O, I, S, T). That covers T, O, I, S, and H.\n\n Similarly, ""SHOOT"" is not good because it repeats O.\n\n ""HOIST"" is a valid word and covers five distinct letters: H, O, I, S, T.\n\n This covers the top remaining letters: T (2nd), O (4th), I (5th), S (7th), H (8th). \n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" uses M (which is 11th) instead of H (8th). So ""HOIST"" might be slightly better.\n\n But note: we are not sure about the frequency in 5-letter words, but generally, it\'s similar.\n\n I think ""HOIST"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T. None of these are excluded.\n\n So I will go with ""HOIST"".\n\n But let me confirm: is ""HOIST"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""HOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that avoids these excluded letters and tests new common letters like T, O, I, S, and H to gather more information. ""HOIST"" fits this criteria, as it uses high-frequency letters not yet tested and is a valid 5-letter word.\n\n<guess>HOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HOIST -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters are 'x' (not present). So the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
2. HOIST: 
   - H: '-' meaning present but wrong position
   - O: '✓' meaning correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: 'x' not present
   - S: 'x' not present
   - T: '-' meaning present but wrong position

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position (so it is _ O _ _ _)
- The secret word contains H and T (because of '-' for H and T), but not in the positions we guessed.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, C, R, A, N, E (from both guesses).

Also, from HOIST, we know that H is not in the first position (since we guessed H first and it was wrong position) and T is not in the last position (we guessed T in the last position and it was wrong position).

So, letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), H, T.
Letters excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the second position.
- Contains H and T (but not in position 1 for H and not in position 5 for T? Actually, H can be in any position except 1? Not necessarily, because H could be in position 1 but we marked as '-' meaning that position 1 is not H? Actually, no: when we guessed H in position 1 and got '-', that means H is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we must avoid using the excluded letters: so no C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

Possible positions for H: 3, 4, 5? (since position 1 is excluded by this feedback, and position 2 is O so not H). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so possible positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to include two more letters that we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S (and others we haven't tried? But we haven't tried many).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also know the word has H, T, and O (with O fixed at position 2).

So the word must be: 
Position 1: not H (because H in position 1 was marked wrong), and not excluded. So it can be any letter from the available set except what we know?
Positions: 
1: [B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z] 
But also, T might be in position 1? Yes, because T can be in position 1, 3, or 4.
Similarly, H cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because 2 is O), so H must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Now, we don't know how many letters we have? Actually, we know: the word has at least H, T, and O. There might be more letters, but we need to guess a word that uses only available letters and includes H and T.

We must guess a word that has O in the second position, and contains H and T (with H not in 1 and T not in 5) and avoids all excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and include H and T.

Possibilities:

- Position 1: T? Then the word starts with T O ... and must contain H somewhere in the next three positions? And no excluded letters.

Example: TOUGH? Check: T O U G H. But U and G are allowed? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,I,S. So U and G are okay. Also, H is at the end. Now, check positions: 
- T: position 1, which is allowed? (we don't know if T is in position 1, but we have to try)
- O: position 2 correct.
- H: in position 5? But in our previous guess HOIST had T in position 5 and it was wrong position. So if T was wrong in position 5, then T cannot be in position 5. But we never had H in position 5? So H in position 5 is allowed? Yes.

But what about the word TOUGH? It has O in second, includes T and H. Now, T is in position 1 and H in position 5. This seems okay.

But we need to see if it matches the feedback we have? Actually, we are going to test it.

Another possibility: the word could be THROW? But R is excluded? R is in CRANE exclusion? Yes, R was in CRANE and was 'x', so R is excluded. So no.

Another: maybe FOWTH? Not a word.

We need real words.

Consider: 
- T O W E D? But E and D: E is excluded? E is excluded from CRANE: E was 'x'. So no E.

Another: T O U G H? We thought of TOUGH.

What about T O M B S? But S is excluded? From HOIST, S was 'x', so S is excluded.

Another word: T O U C H? But C is excluded? C was in CRANE, excluded.

Must avoid excluded letters.

List available letters: consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels: O, U (we used O), and Y (sometimes vowel). 
We know O is already at position 2, so we need H and T and two other non-excluded letters.

Possible words:

- TOUCH: invalid because C excluded.
- DOUGH: D O U G H. This has D, U, G, H. But T? Doesn't contain T? We need T because from HOIST feedback, T is present. So the word must include T.

So we need both H and T.

Let me think of words starting with T: T O _ _ _ and having H? 

- TOUGH (yes)
- TROPH? Not a word.
- TOUGH is one.

Words not starting with T: let position 1 be something else and T elsewhere.

For example, position 1: D, then D O ... and must include T and H.

- DOUGH (no T)
- DOWTY? Not a word.
- DROTH? Excluded R.

Position 1: G? G O ... 
- GOUTH? Not a common word? GOUT is 4 letters? 
- GOTHS? But S excluded.

Position 1: H? But we cannot, because H cannot be in position 1 (from HOIST feedback: H in position 1 was yellow, meaning not in position 1). So position 1 cannot be H.

Therefore, position 1 must be a letter that isn't excluded and isn't H.

So possible position 1: T or other letters.

Wait, is T allowed in position 1? Yes, because in HOIST we had T in position 5, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. We only know T cannot be in position 5, but otherwise it can be anywhere.

Similarly, H can be in 3,4,5.

So TOUGH: T O U G H -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5.

Check against exclusions: T,O,U,G,H: none are excluded? T: not excluded? From CRANE: T wasn't in CRANE? Or in HOIST T was present? We know T is in the secret word. So it's allowed. Similarly, U and G not excluded.

So TOUGH seems a valid guess.

But we must ensure: secret word has second letter O and contains H and T? Yes.

Now, is there another word? For example, if T is not in position 1, then it must be in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
- Position 1: B, then B O _ _ _
Must have H and T in positions 3,4,5? But position 5 would be H or T? But T cannot be in position 5? So T must be in 3 or 4? And H in 3,4, or 5 but not 1 or 2.

So let position 3 be T: B O T _ _
Then the word must have H? Then last two positions must have H and another letter? And one of them H? or both? Only two slots.

Example: B O T C H? C excluded.

B O T H ... but two letters? B O T H only 4? We need 5. So 5-letter word: B O T H Y? but H Y. Is BOTHY a word? It's a noun, meaning a bothy, which is a hut? But acceptable? Maybe. But check letters: B,O,T,H,Y. Y is allowed? Not excluded.

But in HOIST, we had T in position 5? Here T is in position 3, which is fine.

But we have H in position 4? So B O T H Y? But that leaves Y at the end? Actually, bothy is often spelled B-O-T-H-Y? So yes.

Alternatively, if position 4 is T? Like B O _ T _ must have H somewhere.

Example: B O U T H? B O U T H? Again, U, T, H. Then positions: B,O,U,T,H. U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Then it would be BOUTH? Not a word? Mouth? But M not excluded, but B O M T H? Not valid.

Let's list all words matching:

Pattern: second letter O, and including H and T, and avoiding C,R,A,N,E,I,S.

Possible words:

1. TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5)
2. BOTHY (B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5)
3. MIGHT? M I G H T? But I is excluded? From HOIST, I was 'x', so I excluded. Can't use.
4. LIGHT? L I G H T? I excluded.
5. DOGMA? No T or H.
6. POUTH? P O U T H? Then P in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5. That could be POUTH? Wait, is that a word? Pouth is a rare word meaning fullness? Or pouter? But it might be accepted? But similarly, letters P,O,U,T,H: U and P allowed? Excluded? P not excluded? CRANE didn't exclude P? Neither HOIST excluded P? So yes.

Another: MOUTH? M O U T H? But U: allowed? M,O,U,T,H? Not excluding any? And avoid excluded letters? 

MOUTH: M in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5.

Wait, but T is in position 4 and H in 5? And in HOIST we guessed T in position 5 which was wrong? So T cannot be in position 5? But here T is in 4? That's fine. And H is in 5? There's no problem.

Similarly, for TOUGH: T in 1 and H in 5? That also avoids T in 5 and H in 1.

So both TOUGH and MOUTH and POUTH might be candidates? But we need to see if they are words? MOUTH is common, TOUGH is common.

But also another word: YOUTH? Y O U T H? Then Y in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Also common.

But exclusions: Y not excluded? Yes.

So we have several: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, BOTHY? Which one to pick?

We need to guess one that provides information for the remaining letters? We don't know what the third letters are.

But we know H and T must be somewhere? Actually, in these words, H is at the end? That's position 5.

But position 5: in HOIST we had T in 5? But that doesn't say anything about H? So H can be in 5.

But we must consider: HOIST feedback: H is present but not in position 1. So H must be in 3,4, or 5. In TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, H is in position 5? So we are testing H in position 5? If it's correct, we get a ✓ for H? Or if wrong, then we know it's not in 5? Which is good.

Similarly, the fourth letter? For example, TOUGH has U and G? MOUTH has U? Etc.

We don't know if the word contains U? So testing U might be good? Because we haven't tried U yet? Similarly, G? M? etc.

Since we have multiple options, we should pick one that tests letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried U, G, M, Y, P, B, etc.

Let me see what letters we have tried so far:

From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E? All excluded.
From HOIST: H, O, I, S, T? O and H and T are known to be present? I and S excluded? We know I and S are excluded.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I, S, T.

Therefore, we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

With TOUGH: we test T, O (already known), U, G, H. So U and G are new? H is known? T is known? O known? So from TOUGH we test U and G.

With MOUTH: tests M, O, U, T, H -> M and U new.

Similarly, YOUTH: Y, O, U, T, H -> Y and U new.

But Y may be less common? Probably not much.

We also need to consider: in TOUGH, T is in position 1? We don't know if T can be in position 1? But we haven't tested position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at position 1? Etc.

A strategy: guess a word that has as many new letters as possible? TOUGH has U and G? That's two new.

MOUTH also has M and U? Two new.

BOTHY? Has B, O, T, H, Y -> O, T, H known? So B and Y new? Also two new.

Since all are two new letters? But TOUGH? U and G? U is a vowel? Perhaps common? G is consonant.

But perhaps you can pick one.

Alternatively, note that we have O fixed at position 2, and we need to place H and T.

But we don't know which positions? By guessing TOUGH, we assume H is in 5 and T in 1? But if the secret word is MOUTH, for example, then H is in 5 but T is in 4? So different positions? So we get information on positions.

Now, considering that we have limited tries? We have used two guesses? So we have four left? Let's try.

I think TOUGH is a reasonable guess? But let me see if there is a word that has H not in position 5? For example, GOTHS? S excluded? Not possible.

Or WORTH? But W O R T H? R excluded? R in excluded? Yes.

PHOTO? P H O T O? Then O at second? Let's see: P in 1, H in 2? But second position must be O? So H cannot be in second? Because HOIST we have O at second? So if we have PHOTO it would be P H O T O? H is at second? But we need second letter O? So not possible? We need position 2 to be O? So PHOTO? P H O T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:H -> but second is H? Not O? So invalid? We need second letter O? So pattern must be XOXXX.

So in TOUGH: positions T O U G H -> O at 2? Correct.

Perhaps GOTHY? Not a word.

OK.

Another candidate: DOUTH? Not a word? Dout means to extinguish? But not common? Doubt? But excluded E? Doubt has E? No, doubt is D O U B T? That's 5 letters? D-O-U-B-T.

Doubt: D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, B in 4, T in 5? But then T is in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5 (from HOIST guess? HOIST had T in position 5 and it was marked '-', meaning present but wrong position? So position 5 is wrong? Therefore T is not in position 5? So DOUBT? Has T in position 5? Which is invalid? Therefore DOUBT is impossible? Similarly, TOUGH has T in 1? Which is not 5? So possible.

Similarly, MOUTH? M O U T H? T is in position 4? Then H in 5? So T is not in 5? So possible? Yes.

YOUTH? Y O U T H? T in position 4? H in 5? Possible.

But DOUBT? D O U B T? T in 5? Impossible.

Similarly, cannot have T in 5.

Therefore, T must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? And not excluded.

Similarly, H must be in positions 3,4,5? But 2 is O? So not 2.

And 5? We can have H in 5? Since we don't know? And it would be fine? For example, in TOUGH: it is in 5? Which we haven't tested? So.

Back to guess: I think TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH are all possibilities? And more? Not many words.

But we have another: LOOTHS? Plural? Not 5? GROUTH? Not a word? So limited.

Perhaps POUTY? But POUTY has no H? So must have H? So no.

Therefore, TOUGH or MOUTH? But in MOUTH, what if we guess? How about YOUTH? Y might be less common? So TOUGH and MOUTH are preferable.

Now, difference: TOUGH has G? MOUTH has M? Both U? We haven't tested U? So either.

Also, BOTHY? B O T H Y? Then T in position 3? Not in 5? And H in 4? So position 4? And B in 1? Y in 5? All ok? And letters B,O,T,H,Y? B and Y new? Exclusions? None? HOIST had S excluded? No.

So valid? And not have U? So we test U or not?

Perhaps if we guess TOUGH and the word is BOTHY, we get feedback? But that's fine.

But let me count possible words:

- TOUGH
- MOUTH
- YOUTH
- POUTH (rare, but might be accepted)
- BOTHY (also rare)
- WOMTH? Not a word? 
- There is also DOHTH? Not a word? 

So common words: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH.

I think YOUTH is also common? So three common ones? But we need to guess one? Either?

We can choose TOUGH because it tests T in position 1? We don't know about position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at 1? 

But TOUGH might be better because U and G are more common? I don't know? Also, in TOUGH, we cover U and G? Which could be useful if the word is something else?

I'll go with TOUGH? But let me think: the feedback from HOIST: H was yellow in position 1? So if we guess TOUGH, with H in position 5? And if H is actually in position 5? We'll get green? Or if not? Then we know H is not in 5? 

Similarly, T in position 1? If it's correct? Or not? So we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't assume H at 5? But we have to guess one with H in 3,4 or 5? And we don't know? So we might as well try.

Perhaps select a word that places H in a position we haven't tried? Like position 3? For example, is there a word like _ O H _ _ with T? And no S, etc?

Example: DOHYK? Not valid? POHTH? Not a word? Not common? So almost? So TOUGH, MOUTH? etc? Are the main ones.

Another word: DOUGHY? Too long? Not? 5-letters required? So no.

I think TOUGH is a safe choice? 

But we haven't considered: what if the word is not having U? Then maybe H could be in 4? Like T O X H T? Not valid? So.

Possible without U: BOTHY? Has H in 4? And T in 3? But we haven't tested B, O, T, H, Y? O and T and H already confirmed? But O in second? So BOTHY: B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5? Then T in position 3? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, H in position 4? Not 5.

With TOUGH, H is in 5? MOUTH H in 5? Etc.

So guess BOTHY? But it's less common? Probably not the secret word? Similarly, POUTH? POUTH is valid? Meaning? But perhaps MOUTH or TOUGH are better.

I'll go with TOUGH? Or MOUTH? 

Since we haven't tried M or G? Perhaps choose one? Maybe flip a coin? But I think TOUGH is fine? Let's see? 

But note: O (position 2) is fixed? So.

Another idea: to maximize information? Guess a word that has letters not used? But also, positions? 

For example, TOUGH tests position 1: T? New? Position 3: U? New? And position 4: G? New? And position 5: H? Which we know, but position? 

Similarly MOUTH: position 1: M? new? Position 3: U? new? Position 4: T? which position for T? We know T? But position? and position 5: H?

So comparable? 

But if we guess TOUGH? We test U and G? Also.

I think TOUGH is a good guess.

So I will guess TOUGH? 

But let me spell: T-O-U-G-H.

Yes? Then.

So <guess>TOUGH</guess>

But let me write the thought? 

Final: based on the feedback, possible words include TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, etc. We choose TOUGH to test the positions of T and H and introduce new letters U and G.

</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- All letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From HOIST: 
  - O is correct and in position 2 (secret word structure: _ O _ _ _)
  - H is present but not in position 1
  - I is absent
  - S is absent
  - T is present but not in position 5

Therefore, the secret word contains:
- O in position 2
- H (not in position 1)
- T (not in position 5)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, S

Possible words must have O as the second letter, include H and T, avoid all excluded letters, and prioritize testing new letter positions and unused letters (U, G, M, Y, P, etc.). After evaluating options like TOUGH (positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5), MOUTH, YOUTH, and BOTHY, TOUGH is selected to:
1. Test T in position 1 (previously untested for T)
2. Test H in position 5 (previously untested for H)
3. Introduce new letters U and G for additional information
4. Conform to common English words.

<guess>TOUGH</guess>",TOUGH,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters are 'x' (not present). So the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
2. HOIST: 
   - H: '-' meaning present but wrong position
   - O: '✓' meaning correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: 'x' not present
   - S: 'x' not present
   - T: '-' meaning present but wrong position

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position (so it is _ O _ _ _)
- The secret word contains H and T (because of '-' for H and T), but not in the positions we guessed.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, C, R, A, N, E (from both guesses).

Also, from HOIST, we know that H is not in the first position (since we guessed H first and it was wrong position) and T is not in the last position (we guessed T in the last position and it was wrong position).

So, letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), H, T.
Letters excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the second position.
- Contains H and T (but not in position 1 for H and not in position 5 for T? Actually, H can be in any position except 1? Not necessarily, because H could be in position 1 but we marked as '-' meaning that position 1 is not H? Actually, no: when we guessed H in position 1 and got '-', that means H is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we must avoid using the excluded letters: so no C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

Possible positions for H: 3, 4, 5? (since position 1 is excluded by this feedback, and position 2 is O so not H). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so possible positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to include two more letters that we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S (and others we haven't tried? But we haven't tried many).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also know the word has H, T, and O (with O fixed at position 2).

So the word must be: 
Position 1: not H (because H in position 1 was marked wrong), and not excluded. So it can be any letter from the available set except what we know?
Positions: 
1: [B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z] 
But also, T might be in position 1? Yes, because T can be in position 1, 3, or 4.
Similarly, H cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because 2 is O), so H must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Now, we don't know how many letters we have? Actually, we know: the word has at least H, T, and O. There might be more letters, but we need to guess a word that uses only available letters and includes H and T.

We must guess a word that has O in the second position, and contains H and T (with H not in 1 and T not in 5) and avoids all excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and include H and T.

Possibilities:

- Position 1: T? Then the word starts with T O ... and must contain H somewhere in the next three positions? And no excluded letters.

Example: TOUGH? Check: T O U G H. But U and G are allowed? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,I,S. So U and G are okay. Also, H is at the end. Now, check positions: 
- T: position 1, which is allowed? (we don't know if T is in position 1, but we have to try)
- O: position 2 correct.
- H: in position 5? But in our previous guess HOIST had T in position 5 and it was wrong position. So if T was wrong in position 5, then T cannot be in position 5. But we never had H in position 5? So H in position 5 is allowed? Yes.

But what about the word TOUGH? It has O in second, includes T and H. Now, T is in position 1 and H in position 5. This seems okay.

But we need to see if it matches the feedback we have? Actually, we are going to test it.

Another possibility: the word could be THROW? But R is excluded? R is in CRANE exclusion? Yes, R was in CRANE and was 'x', so R is excluded. So no.

Another: maybe FOWTH? Not a word.

We need real words.

Consider: 
- T O W E D? But E and D: E is excluded? E is excluded from CRANE: E was 'x'. So no E.

Another: T O U G H? We thought of TOUGH.

What about T O M B S? But S is excluded? From HOIST, S was 'x', so S is excluded.

Another word: T O U C H? But C is excluded? C was in CRANE, excluded.

Must avoid excluded letters.

List available letters: consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels: O, U (we used O), and Y (sometimes vowel). 
We know O is already at position 2, so we need H and T and two other non-excluded letters.

Possible words:

- TOUCH: invalid because C excluded.
- DOUGH: D O U G H. This has D, U, G, H. But T? Doesn't contain T? We need T because from HOIST feedback, T is present. So the word must include T.

So we need both H and T.

Let me think of words starting with T: T O _ _ _ and having H? 

- TOUGH (yes)
- TROPH? Not a word.
- TOUGH is one.

Words not starting with T: let position 1 be something else and T elsewhere.

For example, position 1: D, then D O ... and must include T and H.

- DOUGH (no T)
- DOWTY? Not a word.
- DROTH? Excluded R.

Position 1: G? G O ... 
- GOUTH? Not a common word? GOUT is 4 letters? 
- GOTHS? But S excluded.

Position 1: H? But we cannot, because H cannot be in position 1 (from HOIST feedback: H in position 1 was yellow, meaning not in position 1). So position 1 cannot be H.

Therefore, position 1 must be a letter that isn't excluded and isn't H.

So possible position 1: T or other letters.

Wait, is T allowed in position 1? Yes, because in HOIST we had T in position 5, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. We only know T cannot be in position 5, but otherwise it can be anywhere.

Similarly, H can be in 3,4,5.

So TOUGH: T O U G H -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5.

Check against exclusions: T,O,U,G,H: none are excluded? T: not excluded? From CRANE: T wasn't in CRANE? Or in HOIST T was present? We know T is in the secret word. So it's allowed. Similarly, U and G not excluded.

So TOUGH seems a valid guess.

But we must ensure: secret word has second letter O and contains H and T? Yes.

Now, is there another word? For example, if T is not in position 1, then it must be in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
- Position 1: B, then B O _ _ _
Must have H and T in positions 3,4,5? But position 5 would be H or T? But T cannot be in position 5? So T must be in 3 or 4? And H in 3,4, or 5 but not 1 or 2.

So let position 3 be T: B O T _ _
Then the word must have H? Then last two positions must have H and another letter? And one of them H? or both? Only two slots.

Example: B O T C H? C excluded.

B O T H ... but two letters? B O T H only 4? We need 5. So 5-letter word: B O T H Y? but H Y. Is BOTHY a word? It's a noun, meaning a bothy, which is a hut? But acceptable? Maybe. But check letters: B,O,T,H,Y. Y is allowed? Not excluded.

But in HOIST, we had T in position 5? Here T is in position 3, which is fine.

But we have H in position 4? So B O T H Y? But that leaves Y at the end? Actually, bothy is often spelled B-O-T-H-Y? So yes.

Alternatively, if position 4 is T? Like B O _ T _ must have H somewhere.

Example: B O U T H? B O U T H? Again, U, T, H. Then positions: B,O,U,T,H. U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Then it would be BOUTH? Not a word? Mouth? But M not excluded, but B O M T H? Not valid.

Let's list all words matching:

Pattern: second letter O, and including H and T, and avoiding C,R,A,N,E,I,S.

Possible words:

1. TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5)
2. BOTHY (B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5)
3. MIGHT? M I G H T? But I is excluded? From HOIST, I was 'x', so I excluded. Can't use.
4. LIGHT? L I G H T? I excluded.
5. DOGMA? No T or H.
6. POUTH? P O U T H? Then P in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5. That could be POUTH? Wait, is that a word? Pouth is a rare word meaning fullness? Or pouter? But it might be accepted? But similarly, letters P,O,U,T,H: U and P allowed? Excluded? P not excluded? CRANE didn't exclude P? Neither HOIST excluded P? So yes.

Another: MOUTH? M O U T H? But U: allowed? M,O,U,T,H? Not excluding any? And avoid excluded letters? 

MOUTH: M in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5.

Wait, but T is in position 4 and H in 5? And in HOIST we guessed T in position 5 which was wrong? So T cannot be in position 5? But here T is in 4? That's fine. And H is in 5? There's no problem.

Similarly, for TOUGH: T in 1 and H in 5? That also avoids T in 5 and H in 1.

So both TOUGH and MOUTH and POUTH might be candidates? But we need to see if they are words? MOUTH is common, TOUGH is common.

But also another word: YOUTH? Y O U T H? Then Y in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Also common.

But exclusions: Y not excluded? Yes.

So we have several: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, BOTHY? Which one to pick?

We need to guess one that provides information for the remaining letters? We don't know what the third letters are.

But we know H and T must be somewhere? Actually, in these words, H is at the end? That's position 5.

But position 5: in HOIST we had T in 5? But that doesn't say anything about H? So H can be in 5.

But we must consider: HOIST feedback: H is present but not in position 1. So H must be in 3,4, or 5. In TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, H is in position 5? So we are testing H in position 5? If it's correct, we get a ✓ for H? Or if wrong, then we know it's not in 5? Which is good.

Similarly, the fourth letter? For example, TOUGH has U and G? MOUTH has U? Etc.

We don't know if the word contains U? So testing U might be good? Because we haven't tried U yet? Similarly, G? M? etc.

Since we have multiple options, we should pick one that tests letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried U, G, M, Y, P, B, etc.

Let me see what letters we have tried so far:

From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E? All excluded.
From HOIST: H, O, I, S, T? O and H and T are known to be present? I and S excluded? We know I and S are excluded.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I, S, T.

Therefore, we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

With TOUGH: we test T, O (already known), U, G, H. So U and G are new? H is known? T is known? O known? So from TOUGH we test U and G.

With MOUTH: tests M, O, U, T, H -> M and U new.

Similarly, YOUTH: Y, O, U, T, H -> Y and U new.

But Y may be less common? Probably not much.

We also need to consider: in TOUGH, T is in position 1? We don't know if T can be in position 1? But we haven't tested position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at position 1? Etc.

A strategy: guess a word that has as many new letters as possible? TOUGH has U and G? That's two new.

MOUTH also has M and U? Two new.

BOTHY? Has B, O, T, H, Y -> O, T, H known? So B and Y new? Also two new.

Since all are two new letters? But TOUGH? U and G? U is a vowel? Perhaps common? G is consonant.

But perhaps you can pick one.

Alternatively, note that we have O fixed at position 2, and we need to place H and T.

But we don't know which positions? By guessing TOUGH, we assume H is in 5 and T in 1? But if the secret word is MOUTH, for example, then H is in 5 but T is in 4? So different positions? So we get information on positions.

Now, considering that we have limited tries? We have used two guesses? So we have four left? Let's try.

I think TOUGH is a reasonable guess? But let me see if there is a word that has H not in position 5? For example, GOTHS? S excluded? Not possible.

Or WORTH? But W O R T H? R excluded? R in excluded? Yes.

PHOTO? P H O T O? Then O at second? Let's see: P in 1, H in 2? But second position must be O? So H cannot be in second? Because HOIST we have O at second? So if we have PHOTO it would be P H O T O? H is at second? But we need second letter O? So not possible? We need position 2 to be O? So PHOTO? P H O T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:H -> but second is H? Not O? So invalid? We need second letter O? So pattern must be XOXXX.

So in TOUGH: positions T O U G H -> O at 2? Correct.

Perhaps GOTHY? Not a word.

OK.

Another candidate: DOUTH? Not a word? Dout means to extinguish? But not common? Doubt? But excluded E? Doubt has E? No, doubt is D O U B T? That's 5 letters? D-O-U-B-T.

Doubt: D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, B in 4, T in 5? But then T is in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5 (from HOIST guess? HOIST had T in position 5 and it was marked '-', meaning present but wrong position? So position 5 is wrong? Therefore T is not in position 5? So DOUBT? Has T in position 5? Which is invalid? Therefore DOUBT is impossible? Similarly, TOUGH has T in 1? Which is not 5? So possible.

Similarly, MOUTH? M O U T H? T is in position 4? Then H in 5? So T is not in 5? So possible? Yes.

YOUTH? Y O U T H? T in position 4? H in 5? Possible.

But DOUBT? D O U B T? T in 5? Impossible.

Similarly, cannot have T in 5.

Therefore, T must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? And not excluded.

Similarly, H must be in positions 3,4,5? But 2 is O? So not 2.

And 5? We can have H in 5? Since we don't know? And it would be fine? For example, in TOUGH: it is in 5? Which we haven't tested? So.

Back to guess: I think TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH are all possibilities? And more? Not many words.

But we have another: LOOTHS? Plural? Not 5? GROUTH? Not a word? So limited.

Perhaps POUTY? But POUTY has no H? So must have H? So no.

Therefore, TOUGH or MOUTH? But in MOUTH, what if we guess? How about YOUTH? Y might be less common? So TOUGH and MOUTH are preferable.

Now, difference: TOUGH has G? MOUTH has M? Both U? We haven't tested U? So either.

Also, BOTHY? B O T H Y? Then T in position 3? Not in 5? And H in 4? So position 4? And B in 1? Y in 5? All ok? And letters B,O,T,H,Y? B and Y new? Exclusions? None? HOIST had S excluded? No.

So valid? And not have U? So we test U or not?

Perhaps if we guess TOUGH and the word is BOTHY, we get feedback? But that's fine.

But let me count possible words:

- TOUGH
- MOUTH
- YOUTH
- POUTH (rare, but might be accepted)
- BOTHY (also rare)
- WOMTH? Not a word? 
- There is also DOHTH? Not a word? 

So common words: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH.

I think YOUTH is also common? So three common ones? But we need to guess one? Either?

We can choose TOUGH because it tests T in position 1? We don't know about position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at 1? 

But TOUGH might be better because U and G are more common? I don't know? Also, in TOUGH, we cover U and G? Which could be useful if the word is something else?

I'll go with TOUGH? But let me think: the feedback from HOIST: H was yellow in position 1? So if we guess TOUGH, with H in position 5? And if H is actually in position 5? We'll get green? Or if not? Then we know H is not in 5? 

Similarly, T in position 1? If it's correct? Or not? So we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't assume H at 5? But we have to guess one with H in 3,4 or 5? And we don't know? So we might as well try.

Perhaps select a word that places H in a position we haven't tried? Like position 3? For example, is there a word like _ O H _ _ with T? And no S, etc?

Example: DOHYK? Not valid? POHTH? Not a word? Not common? So almost? So TOUGH, MOUTH? etc? Are the main ones.

Another word: DOUGHY? Too long? Not? 5-letters required? So no.

I think TOUGH is a safe choice? 

But we haven't considered: what if the word is not having U? Then maybe H could be in 4? Like T O X H T? Not valid? So.

Possible without U: BOTHY? Has H in 4? And T in 3? But we haven't tested B, O, T, H, Y? O and T and H already confirmed? But O in second? So BOTHY: B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5? Then T in position 3? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, H in position 4? Not 5.

With TOUGH, H is in 5? MOUTH H in 5? Etc.

So guess BOTHY? But it's less common? Probably not the secret word? Similarly, POUTH? POUTH is valid? Meaning? But perhaps MOUTH or TOUGH are better.

I'll go with TOUGH? Or MOUTH? 

Since we haven't tried M or G? Perhaps choose one? Maybe flip a coin? But I think TOUGH is fine? Let's see? 

But note: O (position 2) is fixed? So.

Another idea: to maximize information? Guess a word that has letters not used? But also, positions? 

For example, TOUGH tests position 1: T? New? Position 3: U? New? And position 4: G? New? And position 5: H? Which we know, but position? 

Similarly MOUTH: position 1: M? new? Position 3: U? new? Position 4: T? which position for T? We know T? But position? and position 5: H?

So comparable? 

But if we guess TOUGH? We test U and G? Also.

I think TOUGH is a good guess.

So I will guess TOUGH? 

But let me spell: T-O-U-G-H.

Yes? Then.

So <guess>TOUGH</guess>

But let me write the thought? 

Final: based on the feedback, possible words include TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, etc. We choose TOUGH to test the positions of T and H and introduce new letters U and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- All letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From HOIST: 
  - O is correct and in position 2 (secret word structure: _ O _ _ _)
  - H is present but not in position 1
  - I is absent
  - S is absent
  - T is present but not in position 5

Therefore, the secret word contains:
- O in position 2
- H (not in position 1)
- T (not in position 5)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, S

Possible words must have O as the second letter, include H and T, avoid all excluded letters, and prioritize testing new letter positions and unused letters (U, G, M, Y, P, etc.). After evaluating options like TOUGH (positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5), MOUTH, YOUTH, and BOTHY, TOUGH is selected to:
1. Test T in position 1 (previously untested for T)
2. Test H in position 5 (previously untested for H)
3. Introduce new letters U and G for additional information
4. Conform to common English words.",Guess 3: TOUGH -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(✓) G(x) H(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We have no information yet.
 A good starting guess should have a variety of unique letters and include common vowels and consonants.
 Often, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc., are chosen because they contain common letters.
 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English words.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good candidate: it has C, R, A, N, E. These are fairly common.

 However, note that the feedback we receive will be critical for subsequent guesses.

 Let's go with ""CRANE"".

 But let me confirm: we need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""CRANE"" is valid.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".For the first guess, I need a word with common letters to maximize information. A good starting word should include frequent vowels and consonants without repeating letters. ""CRANE"" fits well because it has five distinct letters (C, R, A, N, E), covering common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N). This guess will provide clear feedback on multiple letter positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can use other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels: We have used A and E, so remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).
 Consonants: We have used C, R, N, so we have many left such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""PIOUS"" -> uses P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels, and S is a common consonant.
   ""STOMP"" -> uses S, T, O, M, P. This covers several common consonants and one vowel.

 However, note that we have not used the letter T yet, which is very common.

 Another option: ""SLIPT"" or ""SPLIT"", but we need to avoid the excluded letters. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T. None of these are in the excluded set.

 But wait, we must ensure the word is valid. ""SPLIT"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. However, O and U are vowels, and we might want to test more common letters.

 Considering frequency of letters in English words, the most common letters left are: S, T, L, O, P, M, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""MOIST"" (M, O, I, S, T) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). But note that we have already excluded A and E, so we are safe.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's list some candidate words without those letters:

   - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T
   - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T
   - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> but we have U and B, and we might want to avoid less common letters? However, B and D are common.
   - ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded, so invalid.

 Another idea: ""SHOWY"" (S, H, O, W, Y) but Y is sometimes a vowel and less common.

 We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

 Since we have no information, we should choose a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 The most common letters in English (after E, A, R, which we have already tried and excluded) are: O, I, S, T, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, S, T, L, etc.

 We have excluded: A, C, E, N, R.

 So the top remaining letters: O, I, S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.

 Therefore, a good candidate is ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"".

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it uses S, P, L, I, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these, but we are trying to cover ground.

 Alternatively, we can use ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). However, ""PILOT"" has O and T, which are common.

 I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there are any other words that might cover more of the top letters.

 The top 10 letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D. 
 We have excluded A, E, N, R. So the top remaining are T, O, I, S, H, D.

 So we might want to include T, O, I, S, and H or D.

 A word that includes T, O, I, S, and H? How about ""HOIST"" (H, O, I, S, T). That covers T, O, I, S, and H.

 Similarly, ""SHOOT"" is not good because it repeats O.

 ""HOIST"" is a valid word and covers five distinct letters: H, O, I, S, T.

 This covers the top remaining letters: T (2nd), O (4th), I (5th), S (7th), H (8th). 

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" uses M (which is 11th) instead of H (8th). So ""HOIST"" might be slightly better.

 But note: we are not sure about the frequency in 5-letter words, but generally, it's similar.

 I think ""HOIST"" is a good choice.

 However, we must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T. None of these are excluded.

 So I will go with ""HOIST"".

 But let me confirm: is ""HOIST"" a valid word? Yes.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""HOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that avoids these excluded letters and tests new common letters like T, O, I, S, and H to gather more information. ""HOIST"" fits this criteria, as it uses high-frequency letters not yet tested and is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>HOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: HOIST -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. CRANE: all letters are 'x' (not present). So the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
2. HOIST: 
   - H: '-' meaning present but wrong position
   - O: '✓' meaning correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)
   - I: 'x' not present
   - S: 'x' not present
   - T: '-' meaning present but wrong position

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the second position (so it is _ O _ _ _)
- The secret word contains H and T (because of '-' for H and T), but not in the positions we guessed.
- The secret word does not contain I, S, C, R, A, N, E (from both guesses).

Also, from HOIST, we know that H is not in the first position (since we guessed H first and it was wrong position) and T is not in the last position (we guessed T in the last position and it was wrong position).

So, letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), H, T.
Letters excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the second position.
- Contains H and T (but not in position 1 for H and not in position 5 for T? Actually, H can be in any position except 1? Not necessarily, because H could be in position 1 but we marked as '-' meaning that position 1 is not H? Actually, no: when we guessed H in position 1 and got '-', that means H is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we must avoid using the excluded letters: so no C, R, A, N, E, I, S.

Possible positions for H: 3, 4, 5? (since position 1 is excluded by this feedback, and position 2 is O so not H). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so possible positions 1, 3, or 4.

We also need to include two more letters that we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus the excluded letters: 
Excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S (and others we haven't tried? But we haven't tried many).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also know the word has H, T, and O (with O fixed at position 2).

So the word must be: 
Position 1: not H (because H in position 1 was marked wrong), and not excluded. So it can be any letter from the available set except what we know?
Positions: 
1: [B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z] 
But also, T might be in position 1? Yes, because T can be in position 1, 3, or 4.
Similarly, H cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because 2 is O), so H must be in 3, 4, or 5.

Now, we don't know how many letters we have? Actually, we know: the word has at least H, T, and O. There might be more letters, but we need to guess a word that uses only available letters and includes H and T.

We must guess a word that has O in the second position, and contains H and T (with H not in 1 and T not in 5) and avoids all excluded letters.

Let's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and include H and T.

Possibilities:

- Position 1: T? Then the word starts with T O ... and must contain H somewhere in the next three positions? And no excluded letters.

Example: TOUGH? Check: T O U G H. But U and G are allowed? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,I,S. So U and G are okay. Also, H is at the end. Now, check positions: 
- T: position 1, which is allowed? (we don't know if T is in position 1, but we have to try)
- O: position 2 correct.
- H: in position 5? But in our previous guess HOIST had T in position 5 and it was wrong position. So if T was wrong in position 5, then T cannot be in position 5. But we never had H in position 5? So H in position 5 is allowed? Yes.

But what about the word TOUGH? It has O in second, includes T and H. Now, T is in position 1 and H in position 5. This seems okay.

But we need to see if it matches the feedback we have? Actually, we are going to test it.

Another possibility: the word could be THROW? But R is excluded? R is in CRANE exclusion? Yes, R was in CRANE and was 'x', so R is excluded. So no.

Another: maybe FOWTH? Not a word.

We need real words.

Consider: 
- T O W E D? But E and D: E is excluded? E is excluded from CRANE: E was 'x'. So no E.

Another: T O U G H? We thought of TOUGH.

What about T O M B S? But S is excluded? From HOIST, S was 'x', so S is excluded.

Another word: T O U C H? But C is excluded? C was in CRANE, excluded.

Must avoid excluded letters.

List available letters: consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels: O, U (we used O), and Y (sometimes vowel). 
We know O is already at position 2, so we need H and T and two other non-excluded letters.

Possible words:

- TOUCH: invalid because C excluded.
- DOUGH: D O U G H. This has D, U, G, H. But T? Doesn't contain T? We need T because from HOIST feedback, T is present. So the word must include T.

So we need both H and T.

Let me think of words starting with T: T O _ _ _ and having H? 

- TOUGH (yes)
- TROPH? Not a word.
- TOUGH is one.

Words not starting with T: let position 1 be something else and T elsewhere.

For example, position 1: D, then D O ... and must include T and H.

- DOUGH (no T)
- DOWTY? Not a word.
- DROTH? Excluded R.

Position 1: G? G O ... 
- GOUTH? Not a common word? GOUT is 4 letters? 
- GOTHS? But S excluded.

Position 1: H? But we cannot, because H cannot be in position 1 (from HOIST feedback: H in position 1 was yellow, meaning not in position 1). So position 1 cannot be H.

Therefore, position 1 must be a letter that isn't excluded and isn't H.

So possible position 1: T or other letters.

Wait, is T allowed in position 1? Yes, because in HOIST we had T in position 5, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. We only know T cannot be in position 5, but otherwise it can be anywhere.

Similarly, H can be in 3,4,5.

So TOUGH: T O U G H -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5.

Check against exclusions: T,O,U,G,H: none are excluded? T: not excluded? From CRANE: T wasn't in CRANE? Or in HOIST T was present? We know T is in the secret word. So it's allowed. Similarly, U and G not excluded.

So TOUGH seems a valid guess.

But we must ensure: secret word has second letter O and contains H and T? Yes.

Now, is there another word? For example, if T is not in position 1, then it must be in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
- Position 1: B, then B O _ _ _
Must have H and T in positions 3,4,5? But position 5 would be H or T? But T cannot be in position 5? So T must be in 3 or 4? And H in 3,4, or 5 but not 1 or 2.

So let position 3 be T: B O T _ _
Then the word must have H? Then last two positions must have H and another letter? And one of them H? or both? Only two slots.

Example: B O T C H? C excluded.

B O T H ... but two letters? B O T H only 4? We need 5. So 5-letter word: B O T H Y? but H Y. Is BOTHY a word? It's a noun, meaning a bothy, which is a hut? But acceptable? Maybe. But check letters: B,O,T,H,Y. Y is allowed? Not excluded.

But in HOIST, we had T in position 5? Here T is in position 3, which is fine.

But we have H in position 4? So B O T H Y? But that leaves Y at the end? Actually, bothy is often spelled B-O-T-H-Y? So yes.

Alternatively, if position 4 is T? Like B O _ T _ must have H somewhere.

Example: B O U T H? B O U T H? Again, U, T, H. Then positions: B,O,U,T,H. U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Then it would be BOUTH? Not a word? Mouth? But M not excluded, but B O M T H? Not valid.

Let's list all words matching:

Pattern: second letter O, and including H and T, and avoiding C,R,A,N,E,I,S.

Possible words:

1. TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5)
2. BOTHY (B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5)
3. MIGHT? M I G H T? But I is excluded? From HOIST, I was 'x', so I excluded. Can't use.
4. LIGHT? L I G H T? I excluded.
5. DOGMA? No T or H.
6. POUTH? P O U T H? Then P in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5. That could be POUTH? Wait, is that a word? Pouth is a rare word meaning fullness? Or pouter? But it might be accepted? But similarly, letters P,O,U,T,H: U and P allowed? Excluded? P not excluded? CRANE didn't exclude P? Neither HOIST excluded P? So yes.

Another: MOUTH? M O U T H? But U: allowed? M,O,U,T,H? Not excluding any? And avoid excluded letters? 

MOUTH: M in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5.

Wait, but T is in position 4 and H in 5? And in HOIST we guessed T in position 5 which was wrong? So T cannot be in position 5? But here T is in 4? That's fine. And H is in 5? There's no problem.

Similarly, for TOUGH: T in 1 and H in 5? That also avoids T in 5 and H in 1.

So both TOUGH and MOUTH and POUTH might be candidates? But we need to see if they are words? MOUTH is common, TOUGH is common.

But also another word: YOUTH? Y O U T H? Then Y in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Also common.

But exclusions: Y not excluded? Yes.

So we have several: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, BOTHY? Which one to pick?

We need to guess one that provides information for the remaining letters? We don't know what the third letters are.

But we know H and T must be somewhere? Actually, in these words, H is at the end? That's position 5.

But position 5: in HOIST we had T in 5? But that doesn't say anything about H? So H can be in 5.

But we must consider: HOIST feedback: H is present but not in position 1. So H must be in 3,4, or 5. In TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, H is in position 5? So we are testing H in position 5? If it's correct, we get a ✓ for H? Or if wrong, then we know it's not in 5? Which is good.

Similarly, the fourth letter? For example, TOUGH has U and G? MOUTH has U? Etc.

We don't know if the word contains U? So testing U might be good? Because we haven't tried U yet? Similarly, G? M? etc.

Since we have multiple options, we should pick one that tests letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried U, G, M, Y, P, B, etc.

Let me see what letters we have tried so far:

From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E? All excluded.
From HOIST: H, O, I, S, T? O and H and T are known to be present? I and S excluded? We know I and S are excluded.

So we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I, S, T.

Therefore, we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

With TOUGH: we test T, O (already known), U, G, H. So U and G are new? H is known? T is known? O known? So from TOUGH we test U and G.

With MOUTH: tests M, O, U, T, H -> M and U new.

Similarly, YOUTH: Y, O, U, T, H -> Y and U new.

But Y may be less common? Probably not much.

We also need to consider: in TOUGH, T is in position 1? We don't know if T can be in position 1? But we haven't tested position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at position 1? Etc.

A strategy: guess a word that has as many new letters as possible? TOUGH has U and G? That's two new.

MOUTH also has M and U? Two new.

BOTHY? Has B, O, T, H, Y -> O, T, H known? So B and Y new? Also two new.

Since all are two new letters? But TOUGH? U and G? U is a vowel? Perhaps common? G is consonant.

But perhaps you can pick one.

Alternatively, note that we have O fixed at position 2, and we need to place H and T.

But we don't know which positions? By guessing TOUGH, we assume H is in 5 and T in 1? But if the secret word is MOUTH, for example, then H is in 5 but T is in 4? So different positions? So we get information on positions.

Now, considering that we have limited tries? We have used two guesses? So we have four left? Let's try.

I think TOUGH is a reasonable guess? But let me see if there is a word that has H not in position 5? For example, GOTHS? S excluded? Not possible.

Or WORTH? But W O R T H? R excluded? R in excluded? Yes.

PHOTO? P H O T O? Then O at second? Let's see: P in 1, H in 2? But second position must be O? So H cannot be in second? Because HOIST we have O at second? So if we have PHOTO it would be P H O T O? H is at second? But we need second letter O? So not possible? We need position 2 to be O? So PHOTO? P H O T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:H -> but second is H? Not O? So invalid? We need second letter O? So pattern must be XOXXX.

So in TOUGH: positions T O U G H -> O at 2? Correct.

Perhaps GOTHY? Not a word.

OK.

Another candidate: DOUTH? Not a word? Dout means to extinguish? But not common? Doubt? But excluded E? Doubt has E? No, doubt is D O U B T? That's 5 letters? D-O-U-B-T.

Doubt: D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, B in 4, T in 5? But then T is in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5 (from HOIST guess? HOIST had T in position 5 and it was marked '-', meaning present but wrong position? So position 5 is wrong? Therefore T is not in position 5? So DOUBT? Has T in position 5? Which is invalid? Therefore DOUBT is impossible? Similarly, TOUGH has T in 1? Which is not 5? So possible.

Similarly, MOUTH? M O U T H? T is in position 4? Then H in 5? So T is not in 5? So possible? Yes.

YOUTH? Y O U T H? T in position 4? H in 5? Possible.

But DOUBT? D O U B T? T in 5? Impossible.

Similarly, cannot have T in 5.

Therefore, T must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? And not excluded.

Similarly, H must be in positions 3,4,5? But 2 is O? So not 2.

And 5? We can have H in 5? Since we don't know? And it would be fine? For example, in TOUGH: it is in 5? Which we haven't tested? So.

Back to guess: I think TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH are all possibilities? And more? Not many words.

But we have another: LOOTHS? Plural? Not 5? GROUTH? Not a word? So limited.

Perhaps POUTY? But POUTY has no H? So must have H? So no.

Therefore, TOUGH or MOUTH? But in MOUTH, what if we guess? How about YOUTH? Y might be less common? So TOUGH and MOUTH are preferable.

Now, difference: TOUGH has G? MOUTH has M? Both U? We haven't tested U? So either.

Also, BOTHY? B O T H Y? Then T in position 3? Not in 5? And H in 4? So position 4? And B in 1? Y in 5? All ok? And letters B,O,T,H,Y? B and Y new? Exclusions? None? HOIST had S excluded? No.

So valid? And not have U? So we test U or not?

Perhaps if we guess TOUGH and the word is BOTHY, we get feedback? But that's fine.

But let me count possible words:

- TOUGH
- MOUTH
- YOUTH
- POUTH (rare, but might be accepted)
- BOTHY (also rare)
- WOMTH? Not a word? 
- There is also DOHTH? Not a word? 

So common words: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH.

I think YOUTH is also common? So three common ones? But we need to guess one? Either?

We can choose TOUGH because it tests T in position 1? We don't know about position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at 1? 

But TOUGH might be better because U and G are more common? I don't know? Also, in TOUGH, we cover U and G? Which could be useful if the word is something else?

I'll go with TOUGH? But let me think: the feedback from HOIST: H was yellow in position 1? So if we guess TOUGH, with H in position 5? And if H is actually in position 5? We'll get green? Or if not? Then we know H is not in 5? 

Similarly, T in position 1? If it's correct? Or not? So we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't assume H at 5? But we have to guess one with H in 3,4 or 5? And we don't know? So we might as well try.

Perhaps select a word that places H in a position we haven't tried? Like position 3? For example, is there a word like _ O H _ _ with T? And no S, etc?

Example: DOHYK? Not valid? POHTH? Not a word? Not common? So almost? So TOUGH, MOUTH? etc? Are the main ones.

Another word: DOUGHY? Too long? Not? 5-letters required? So no.

I think TOUGH is a safe choice? 

But we haven't considered: what if the word is not having U? Then maybe H could be in 4? Like T O X H T? Not valid? So.

Possible without U: BOTHY? Has H in 4? And T in 3? But we haven't tested B, O, T, H, Y? O and T and H already confirmed? But O in second? So BOTHY: B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5? Then T in position 3? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, H in position 4? Not 5.

With TOUGH, H is in 5? MOUTH H in 5? Etc.

So guess BOTHY? But it's less common? Probably not the secret word? Similarly, POUTH? POUTH is valid? Meaning? But perhaps MOUTH or TOUGH are better.

I'll go with TOUGH? Or MOUTH? 

Since we haven't tried M or G? Perhaps choose one? Maybe flip a coin? But I think TOUGH is fine? Let's see? 

But note: O (position 2) is fixed? So.

Another idea: to maximize information? Guess a word that has letters not used? But also, positions? 

For example, TOUGH tests position 1: T? New? Position 3: U? New? And position 4: G? New? And position 5: H? Which we know, but position? 

Similarly MOUTH: position 1: M? new? Position 3: U? new? Position 4: T? which position for T? We know T? But position? and position 5: H?

So comparable? 

But if we guess TOUGH? We test U and G? Also.

I think TOUGH is a good guess.

So I will guess TOUGH? 

But let me spell: T-O-U-G-H.

Yes? Then.

So <guess>TOUGH</guess>

But let me write the thought? 

Final: based on the feedback, possible words include TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, etc. We choose TOUGH to test the positions of T and H and introduce new letters U and G.Based on the previous feedback:

- All letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- From HOIST: 
  - O is correct and in position 2 (secret word structure: _ O _ _ _)
  - H is present but not in position 1
  - I is absent
  - S is absent
  - T is present but not in position 5

Therefore, the secret word contains:
- O in position 2
- H (not in position 1)
- T (not in position 5)
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, S

Possible words must have O as the second letter, include H and T, avoid all excluded letters, and prioritize testing new letter positions and unused letters (U, G, M, Y, P, etc.). After evaluating options like TOUGH (positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5), MOUTH, YOUTH, and BOTHY, TOUGH is selected to:
1. Test T in position 1 (previously untested for T)
2. Test H in position 5 (previously untested for H)
3. Introduce new letters U and G for additional information
4. Conform to common English words.

However, B and D are common.\n   - ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded, so invalid.\n\n Another idea: ""SHOWY"" (S, H, O, W, Y) but Y is sometimes a vowel and less common.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n Since we have no information, we should choose a word with high-frequency letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n The most common letters in English (after E, A, R, which we have already tried and excluded) are: O, I, S, T, N (but N is excluded), so next are O, I, S, T, L, etc.\n\n We have excluded: A, C, E, N, R.\n\n So the top remaining letters: O, I, S, T, L, P, M, D, etc.\n\n Therefore, a good candidate is ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"".\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it uses S, P, L, I, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these, but we are trying to cover ground.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) or ""PILOT"" (P, I, L, O, T). However, ""PILOT"" has O and T, which are common.\n\n I think ""SPLIT"" is a good choice.\n\n However, let me check if there are any other words that might cover more of the top letters.\n\n The top 10 letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D. \n We have excluded A, E, N, R. So the top remaining are T, O, I, S, H, D.\n\n So we might want to include T, O, I, S, and H or D.\n\n A word that includes T, O, I, S, and H? How about ""HOIST"" (H, O, I, S, T). That covers T, O, I, S, and H.\n\n Similarly, ""SHOOT"" is not good because it repeats O.\n\n ""HOIST"" is a valid word and covers five distinct letters: H, O, I, S, T.\n\n This covers the top remaining letters: T (2nd), O (4th), I (5th), S (7th), H (8th). \n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" uses M (which is 11th) instead of H (8th). So ""HOIST"" might be slightly better.\n\n But note: we are not sure about the frequency in 5-letter words, but generally, it\'s similar.\n\n I think ""HOIST"" is a good choice.\n\n However, we must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T. None of these are excluded.\n\n So I will go with ""HOIST"".\n\n But let me confirm: is ""HOIST"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""HOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. For the second guess, I need a word that avoids these excluded letters and tests new common letters like T, O, I, S, and H to gather more information. ""HOIST"" fits this criteria, as it uses high-frequency letters not yet tested and is a valid 5-letter word.\n\n<guess>HOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HOIST -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\n1. CRANE: all letters are 'x' (not present). So the secret word does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.\n2. HOIST: \n   - H: '-' meaning present but wrong position\n   - O: '✓' meaning correct and in the correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is O)\n   - I: 'x' not present\n   - S: 'x' not present\n   - T: '-' meaning present but wrong position\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the second position (so it is _ O _ _ _)\n- The secret word contains H and T (because of '-' for H and T), but not in the positions we guessed.\n- The secret word does not contain I, S, C, R, A, N, E (from both guesses).\n\nAlso, from HOIST, we know that H is not in the first position (since we guessed H first and it was wrong position) and T is not in the last position (we guessed T in the last position and it was wrong position).\n\nSo, letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), H, T.\nLetters excluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S.\n\nWe need to guess a 5-letter word that:\n- Has O in the second position.\n- Contains H and T (but not in position 1 for H and not in position 5 for T? Actually, H can be in any position except 1? Not necessarily, because H could be in position 1 but we marked as '-' meaning that position 1 is not H? Actually, no: when we guessed H in position 1 and got '-', that means H is in the word but not in position 1. Similarly, T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nAlso, we must avoid using the excluded letters: so no C, R, A, N, E, I, S.\n\nPossible positions for H: 3, 4, 5? (since position 1 is excluded by this feedback, and position 2 is O so not H). Similarly, T cannot be in position 5, so possible positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also need to include two more letters that we haven't excluded.\n\nWhat letters are available? The alphabet minus the excluded letters: \nExcluded: C, R, A, N, E, I, S (and others we haven't tried? But we haven't tried many).\n\nWe haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we also know the word has H, T, and O (with O fixed at position 2).\n\nSo the word must be: \nPosition 1: not H (because H in position 1 was marked wrong), and not excluded. So it can be any letter from the available set except what we know?\nPositions: \n1: [B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z] \nBut also, T might be in position 1? Yes, because T can be in position 1, 3, or 4.\nSimilarly, H cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because 2 is O), so H must be in 3, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, we don't know how many letters we have? Actually, we know: the word has at least H, T, and O. There might be more letters, but we need to guess a word that uses only available letters and includes H and T.\n\nWe must guess a word that has O in the second position, and contains H and T (with H not in 1 and T not in 5) and avoids all excluded letters.\n\nLet's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O _ _ _ and include H and T.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n- Position 1: T? Then the word starts with T O ... and must contain H somewhere in the next three positions? And no excluded letters.\n\nExample: TOUGH? Check: T O U G H. But U and G are allowed? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,I,S. So U and G are okay. Also, H is at the end. Now, check positions: \n- T: position 1, which is allowed? (we don't know if T is in position 1, but we have to try)\n- O: position 2 correct.\n- H: in position 5? But in our previous guess HOIST had T in position 5 and it was wrong position. So if T was wrong in position 5, then T cannot be in position 5. But we never had H in position 5? So H in position 5 is allowed? Yes.\n\nBut what about the word TOUGH? It has O in second, includes T and H. Now, T is in position 1 and H in position 5. This seems okay.\n\nBut we need to see if it matches the feedback we have? Actually, we are going to test it.\n\nAnother possibility: the word could be THROW? But R is excluded? R is in CRANE exclusion? Yes, R was in CRANE and was 'x', so R is excluded. So no.\n\nAnother: maybe FOWTH? Not a word.\n\nWe need real words.\n\nConsider: \n- T O W E D? But E and D: E is excluded? E is excluded from CRANE: E was 'x'. So no E.\n\nAnother: T O U G H? We thought of TOUGH.\n\nWhat about T O M B S? But S is excluded? From HOIST, S was 'x', so S is excluded.\n\nAnother word: T O U C H? But C is excluded? C was in CRANE, excluded.\n\nMust avoid excluded letters.\n\nList available letters: consonants: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels: O, U (we used O), and Y (sometimes vowel). \nWe know O is already at position 2, so we need H and T and two other non-excluded letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- TOUCH: invalid because C excluded.\n- DOUGH: D O U G H. This has D, U, G, H. But T? Doesn't contain T? We need T because from HOIST feedback, T is present. So the word must include T.\n\nSo we need both H and T.\n\nLet me think of words starting with T: T O _ _ _ and having H? \n\n- TOUGH (yes)\n- TROPH? Not a word.\n- TOUGH is one.\n\nWords not starting with T: let position 1 be something else and T elsewhere.\n\nFor example, position 1: D, then D O ... and must include T and H.\n\n- DOUGH (no T)\n- DOWTY? Not a word.\n- DROTH? Excluded R.\n\nPosition 1: G? G O ... \n- GOUTH? Not a common word? GOUT is 4 letters? \n- GOTHS? But S excluded.\n\nPosition 1: H? But we cannot, because H cannot be in position 1 (from HOIST feedback: H in position 1 was yellow, meaning not in position 1). So position 1 cannot be H.\n\nTherefore, position 1 must be a letter that isn't excluded and isn't H.\n\nSo possible position 1: T or other letters.\n\nWait, is T allowed in position 1? Yes, because in HOIST we had T in position 5, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. We only know T cannot be in position 5, but otherwise it can be anywhere.\n\nSimilarly, H can be in 3,4,5.\n\nSo TOUGH: T O U G H -> positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5.\n\nCheck against exclusions: T,O,U,G,H: none are excluded? T: not excluded? From CRANE: T wasn't in CRANE? Or in HOIST T was present? We know T is in the secret word. So it's allowed. Similarly, U and G not excluded.\n\nSo TOUGH seems a valid guess.\n\nBut we must ensure: secret word has second letter O and contains H and T? Yes.\n\nNow, is there another word? For example, if T is not in position 1, then it must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example: \n- Position 1: B, then B O _ _ _\nMust have H and T in positions 3,4,5? But position 5 would be H or T? But T cannot be in position 5? So T must be in 3 or 4? And H in 3,4, or 5 but not 1 or 2.\n\nSo let position 3 be T: B O T _ _\nThen the word must have H? Then last two positions must have H and another letter? And one of them H? or both? Only two slots.\n\nExample: B O T C H? C excluded.\n\nB O T H ... but two letters? B O T H only 4? We need 5. So 5-letter word: B O T H Y? but H Y. Is BOTHY a word? It's a noun, meaning a bothy, which is a hut? But acceptable? Maybe. But check letters: B,O,T,H,Y. Y is allowed? Not excluded.\n\nBut in HOIST, we had T in position 5? Here T is in position 3, which is fine.\n\nBut we have H in position 4? So B O T H Y? But that leaves Y at the end? Actually, bothy is often spelled B-O-T-H-Y? So yes.\n\nAlternatively, if position 4 is T? Like B O _ T _ must have H somewhere.\n\nExample: B O U T H? B O U T H? Again, U, T, H. Then positions: B,O,U,T,H. U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Then it would be BOUTH? Not a word? Mouth? But M not excluded, but B O M T H? Not valid.\n\nLet's list all words matching:\n\nPattern: second letter O, and including H and T, and avoiding C,R,A,N,E,I,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n1. TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5)\n2. BOTHY (B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5)\n3. MIGHT? M I G H T? But I is excluded? From HOIST, I was 'x', so I excluded. Can't use.\n4. LIGHT? L I G H T? I excluded.\n5. DOGMA? No T or H.\n6. POUTH? P O U T H? Then P in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5. That could be POUTH? Wait, is that a word? Pouth is a rare word meaning fullness? Or pouter? But it might be accepted? But similarly, letters P,O,U,T,H: U and P allowed? Excluded? P not excluded? CRANE didn't exclude P? Neither HOIST excluded P? So yes.\n\nAnother: MOUTH? M O U T H? But U: allowed? M,O,U,T,H? Not excluding any? And avoid excluded letters? \n\nMOUTH: M in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5.\n\nWait, but T is in position 4 and H in 5? And in HOIST we guessed T in position 5 which was wrong? So T cannot be in position 5? But here T is in 4? That's fine. And H is in 5? There's no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for TOUGH: T in 1 and H in 5? That also avoids T in 5 and H in 1.\n\nSo both TOUGH and MOUTH and POUTH might be candidates? But we need to see if they are words? MOUTH is common, TOUGH is common.\n\nBut also another word: YOUTH? Y O U T H? Then Y in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, H in 5? Also common.\n\nBut exclusions: Y not excluded? Yes.\n\nSo we have several: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, BOTHY? Which one to pick?\n\nWe need to guess one that provides information for the remaining letters? We don't know what the third letters are.\n\nBut we know H and T must be somewhere? Actually, in these words, H is at the end? That's position 5.\n\nBut position 5: in HOIST we had T in 5? But that doesn't say anything about H? So H can be in 5.\n\nBut we must consider: HOIST feedback: H is present but not in position 1. So H must be in 3,4, or 5. In TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH, H is in position 5? So we are testing H in position 5? If it's correct, we get a ✓ for H? Or if wrong, then we know it's not in 5? Which is good.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth letter? For example, TOUGH has U and G? MOUTH has U? Etc.\n\nWe don't know if the word contains U? So testing U might be good? Because we haven't tried U yet? Similarly, G? M? etc.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we should pick one that tests letters we haven't tried? We haven't tried U, G, M, Y, P, B, etc.\n\nLet me see what letters we have tried so far:\n\nFrom CRANE: C, R, A, N, E? All excluded.\nFrom HOIST: H, O, I, S, T? O and H and T are known to be present? I and S excluded? We know I and S are excluded.\n\nSo we have tried: C, R, A, N, E, H, O, I, S, T.\n\nTherefore, we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWith TOUGH: we test T, O (already known), U, G, H. So U and G are new? H is known? T is known? O known? So from TOUGH we test U and G.\n\nWith MOUTH: tests M, O, U, T, H -> M and U new.\n\nSimilarly, YOUTH: Y, O, U, T, H -> Y and U new.\n\nBut Y may be less common? Probably not much.\n\nWe also need to consider: in TOUGH, T is in position 1? We don't know if T can be in position 1? But we haven't tested position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at position 1? Etc.\n\nA strategy: guess a word that has as many new letters as possible? TOUGH has U and G? That's two new.\n\nMOUTH also has M and U? Two new.\n\nBOTHY? Has B, O, T, H, Y -> O, T, H known? So B and Y new? Also two new.\n\nSince all are two new letters? But TOUGH? U and G? U is a vowel? Perhaps common? G is consonant.\n\nBut perhaps you can pick one.\n\nAlternatively, note that we have O fixed at position 2, and we need to place H and T.\n\nBut we don't know which positions? By guessing TOUGH, we assume H is in 5 and T in 1? But if the secret word is MOUTH, for example, then H is in 5 but T is in 4? So different positions? So we get information on positions.\n\nNow, considering that we have limited tries? We have used two guesses? So we have four left? Let's try.\n\nI think TOUGH is a reasonable guess? But let me see if there is a word that has H not in position 5? For example, GOTHS? S excluded? Not possible.\n\nOr WORTH? But W O R T H? R excluded? R in excluded? Yes.\n\nPHOTO? P H O T O? Then O at second? Let's see: P in 1, H in 2? But second position must be O? So H cannot be in second? Because HOIST we have O at second? So if we have PHOTO it would be P H O T O? H is at second? But we need second letter O? So not possible? We need position 2 to be O? So PHOTO? P H O T O -> positions: 1:P, 2:H -> but second is H? Not O? So invalid? We need second letter O? So pattern must be XOXXX.\n\nSo in TOUGH: positions T O U G H -> O at 2? Correct.\n\nPerhaps GOTHY? Not a word.\n\nOK.\n\nAnother candidate: DOUTH? Not a word? Dout means to extinguish? But not common? Doubt? But excluded E? Doubt has E? No, doubt is D O U B T? That's 5 letters? D-O-U-B-T.\n\nDoubt: D in 1, O in 2, U in 3, B in 4, T in 5? But then T is in position 5? But we know T cannot be in position 5 (from HOIST guess? HOIST had T in position 5 and it was marked '-', meaning present but wrong position? So position 5 is wrong? Therefore T is not in position 5? So DOUBT? Has T in position 5? Which is invalid? Therefore DOUBT is impossible? Similarly, TOUGH has T in 1? Which is not 5? So possible.\n\nSimilarly, MOUTH? M O U T H? T is in position 4? Then H in 5? So T is not in 5? So possible? Yes.\n\nYOUTH? Y O U T H? T in position 4? H in 5? Possible.\n\nBut DOUBT? D O U B T? T in 5? Impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot have T in 5.\n\nTherefore, T must be in positions 1, 3, or 4? And not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, H must be in positions 3,4,5? But 2 is O? So not 2.\n\nAnd 5? We can have H in 5? Since we don't know? And it would be fine? For example, in TOUGH: it is in 5? Which we haven't tested? So.\n\nBack to guess: I think TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH are all possibilities? And more? Not many words.\n\nBut we have another: LOOTHS? Plural? Not 5? GROUTH? Not a word? So limited.\n\nPerhaps POUTY? But POUTY has no H? So must have H? So no.\n\nTherefore, TOUGH or MOUTH? But in MOUTH, what if we guess? How about YOUTH? Y might be less common? So TOUGH and MOUTH are preferable.\n\nNow, difference: TOUGH has G? MOUTH has M? Both U? We haven't tested U? So either.\n\nAlso, BOTHY? B O T H Y? Then T in position 3? Not in 5? And H in 4? So position 4? And B in 1? Y in 5? All ok? And letters B,O,T,H,Y? B and Y new? Exclusions? None? HOIST had S excluded? No.\n\nSo valid? And not have U? So we test U or not?\n\nPerhaps if we guess TOUGH and the word is BOTHY, we get feedback? But that's fine.\n\nBut let me count possible words:\n\n- TOUGH\n- MOUTH\n- YOUTH\n- POUTH (rare, but might be accepted)\n- BOTHY (also rare)\n- WOMTH? Not a word? \n- There is also DOHTH? Not a word? \n\nSo common words: TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH.\n\nI think YOUTH is also common? So three common ones? But we need to guess one? Either?\n\nWe can choose TOUGH because it tests T in position 1? We don't know about position 1? Similarly, MOUTH tests M at 1? \n\nBut TOUGH might be better because U and G are more common? I don't know? Also, in TOUGH, we cover U and G? Which could be useful if the word is something else?\n\nI'll go with TOUGH? But let me think: the feedback from HOIST: H was yellow in position 1? So if we guess TOUGH, with H in position 5? And if H is actually in position 5? We'll get green? Or if not? Then we know H is not in 5? \n\nSimilarly, T in position 1? If it's correct? Or not? So we get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't assume H at 5? But we have to guess one with H in 3,4 or 5? And we don't know? So we might as well try.\n\nPerhaps select a word that places H in a position we haven't tried? Like position 3? For example, is there a word like _ O H _ _ with T? And no S, etc?\n\nExample: DOHYK? Not valid? POHTH? Not a word? Not common? So almost? So TOUGH, MOUTH? etc? Are the main ones.\n\nAnother word: DOUGHY? Too long? Not? 5-letters required? So no.\n\nI think TOUGH is a safe choice? \n\nBut we haven't considered: what if the word is not having U? Then maybe H could be in 4? Like T O X H T? Not valid? So.\n\nPossible without U: BOTHY? Has H in 4? And T in 3? But we haven't tested B, O, T, H, Y? O and T and H already confirmed? But O in second? So BOTHY: B in 1, O in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5? Then T in position 3? Which we haven't tested before? Similarly, H in position 4? Not 5.\n\nWith TOUGH, H is in 5? MOUTH H in 5? Etc.\n\nSo guess BOTHY? But it's less common? Probably not the secret word? Similarly, POUTH? POUTH is valid? Meaning? But perhaps MOUTH or TOUGH are better.\n\nI'll go with TOUGH? Or MOUTH? \n\nSince we haven't tried M or G? Perhaps choose one? Maybe flip a coin? But I think TOUGH is fine? Let's see? \n\nBut note: O (position 2) is fixed? So.\n\nAnother idea: to maximize information? Guess a word that has letters not used? But also, positions? \n\nFor example, TOUGH tests position 1: T? New? Position 3: U? New? And position 4: G? New? And position 5: H? Which we know, but position? \n\nSimilarly MOUTH: position 1: M? new? Position 3: U? new? Position 4: T? which position for T? We know T? But position? and position 5: H?\n\nSo comparable? \n\nBut if we guess TOUGH? We test U and G? Also.\n\nI think TOUGH is a good guess.\n\nSo I will guess TOUGH? \n\nBut let me spell: T-O-U-G-H.\n\nYes? Then.\n\nSo <guess>TOUGH</guess>\n\nBut let me write the thought? \n\nFinal: based on the feedback, possible words include TOUGH, MOUTH, YOUTH, etc. We choose TOUGH to test the positions of T and H and introduce new letters U and G.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- All letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.\n- From HOIST: \n  - O is correct and in position 2 (secret word structure: _ O _ _ _)\n  - H is present but not in position 1\n  - I is absent\n  - S is absent\n  - T is present but not in position 5\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains:\n- O in position 2\n- H (not in position 1)\n- T (not in position 5)\n- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, S\n\nPossible words must have O as the second letter, include H and T, avoid all excluded letters, and prioritize testing new letter positions and unused letters (U, G, M, Y, P, etc.). After evaluating options like TOUGH (positions: T in 1, O in 2, U in 3, G in 4, H in 5), MOUTH, YOUTH, and BOTHY, TOUGH is selected to:\n1. Test T in position 1 (previously untested for T)\n2. Test H in position 5 (previously untested for H)\n3. Introduce new letters U and G for additional information\n4. Conform to common English words.\n\n<guess>TOUGH</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: HOIST -> FEEDBACK: H(-) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(-)\nGuess 3: TOUGH -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(✓) U(✓) G(x) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following information:
1. From Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. From Guess 2 (HOIST):
   - H is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as '-')
   - O is in the correct position (position 2, so the word is _ O _ _ _)
   - I and S are not in the word (x)
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked '-')
3. From Guess 3 (TOUGH):
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed T in position 1 and got '-')
   - O is correct in position 2 (✓)
   - U is correct in position 3 (✓) because we got '✓' for U in position 3. So now we know the word has O in position 2 and U in position 3: so the pattern is _ O U _ _
   - G is not in the word (x)
   - H is correct in position 5 (✓). Therefore, the secret word ends with H: _ O U _ H

So the secret word must be in the form: ? O U ? H

We also know the word contains T (from HOIST) and T is not in position 1 (from TOUGH) and not in position 5 (from HOIST, and position 5 is H). So T must be in position 4? Because positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: U, 4: ?, 5: H. Since T must be in the word and cannot be in 1 or 5, and we haven't placed it yet? We tried T in position 1 (in TOUGH) and it was wrong, and position 5 is H? So T must be in position 4? Or could it be in position 4? Because we haven't tried T in position 4? Let's see:

In HOIST, T was in position 5? And it was '-'. Then in TOUGH, T was in position 1? And it was '-'. So the only position left for T is either 3 or 4? But position 3 is U? Because from TOUGH U is in position 3. So we cannot put T in position 3? Because U is fixed there.

Therefore, T must be in position 4? Only possibility? Since positions 3 and 5 are taken by U and H? And 2 by O? So the word is _ O U _ H, and T must be in position 4? Because it must be in the word? And cannot be in 1, because TOUGH guessed T there? And cannot be in 5? And 3 is U? So yes, T must be in position 4.

But let's double-check: the positions we have:
Position 1: unknown letter
Position 2: O
Position 3: U
Position 4: must be T? Because T is in the word? And we've tried position 1 and 5? And position 3 is occupied? So position 4 is the only spot? Yes.

Therefore, the secret word is ? O U T H? Because T in position 4 and U in 3? Then ? O U T H? Position 1 is unknown? And 5:H? So format: [letter]OUTH?

But we also have H in position 5? Which matches.

Now, what letters can be in position 1? It must be a letter not excluded? And we know G is excluded? Because in TOUGH, G was 'x'? So G is excluded? Also excluded: C,R,A,N,E,I,S,G (from previous exclusions).

We must avoid: C,R,A,N,E,I,S,G.

Also from HOIST: I and S excluded? From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E? From TOUGH: G excluded.

Now, remaining letters: available letters are B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? And we need a 5-letter word that ends with OUTH? But O,U,T,H fixed? So only first letter varies.

But the pattern must be [letter]OUTH? So the only one possibility? But we need to list words:

Common words: 
- MOUTH: M O U T H -> available? M is allowed? Not excluded.
- YOUTH: Y O U T H
- SOUTH: but S is excluded? S from HOIST: 'x'. So invalid.
- LOUTH: not common? probably not a valid word? or rare?
- ROUTH: R excluded? R from CRANE: excluded? No.
- POUTH: P O U T H -> P is allowed? Not excluded? POUTH is a word? Meaning: a pouter pigeon? Or a Scottish word for a poath? Rare? But might be accepted? 
- DOUTH: also rare? doubt word? 
- FOUTH: not a word?
- KOUTH: not a word?
- ZOUTH: not a word?

Therefore, probably the common words are MOUTH and YOUTH? And POUTH?

But MOUTH: M not excluded? YOUTH: Y not excluded? Etc.

We now know that the word must be ?OUTH? And we have M and Y as possibilities? Also B? But BOUTH? B O U T H? Is BOUTH a word? Not standard? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely either MOUTH or YOUTH? Or POUTH? 

But POUTH might be less common? 

We need to guess? We have two tries? Or one?

But to confirm: if we guess MOUTH, we get: M in position 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in4, H in5? Then feedback would be all correct? Or if wrong? Maybe.

But we can guess MOUTH? Or YOUTH? 

But according to the feedback? We get ? O U T H? With first letter unknown? Because in TOUGH? We have O,U,H correct? U in position 3? H in 5? O in 2? But T not in1? So position4 must be T? 

So guess MOUTH? But let me see: M is allowed? Yes, because not excluded? Similarly Y? Or P?

But how to distinguish? We don't need? If we guess MOUTH correctly? Then we win? Or if it's YOUTH, we win? Only two possibilities? MOUTH and YOUTH? 

But wait: POUTH? Is it a word? Valid? 

Also BOTHY? Not? Because we have U? Not Y? 

But I think MOUTH is very likely? 

But from the feedback? We have fixed that it ends with OUTH? 

Not necessarily: the pattern ? O U ? H? And we set to ? O U T H? Because of T placement? 

Yes? Because we must place T somewhere? Only position4? 

So then the word is ? O U T H? 

So the candidates: MOUTH, YOUTH, POUTH? 

But in MOUTH? M: letter we haven't tried? 

Similarly for others? 

We have to guess one? Let's choose MOUTH? 

But why MOUTH? We might guess YOUTH? 

But M is a common letter? 

To finish? We guess MOUTH?

But note: from TOUGH feedback: T was marked as '-' in position1? But MOUTH starts with M? So if we guess MOUTH? We have T in position4? Which should be correct? 

Similarly, U and H correct? 

If the word is MOUTH? We win? If not? We see which one? 

But we have other possibilities? Like YOUTH? Or POUTH? 

So we need to list all words ending with OUTH? That avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,I,S,G? And common letters? 

Words: 
- MOUTH
- YOUTH
- POUTH
- LOUTH? Not common? 
- FOUTH? Not common?
- ZOUTH? Not common?
- etc.

So likely, MOUTH or YOUTH? 

But POUTH might also be considered? 

We can choose MOUTH? Because M is more common? Or we guess MOUTH? 

Since we have multiple, we might want to use a guess that helps exclude? But we know the form: ?OUTH? So if we guess MOUTH? And if it's not? Then we know first letter is not M? And next guess YOUTH? Or vice versa? 

But we have tries? We are at guess 3? Next is guess 4? Then we have two? 

But to minimize? We can guess MOUTH? 

But let me think: from HOIST? We had H present? And in TOUGH? H was correct in position5? And U was correct in position3? 

Now, YOUTH? Starts with Y? We haven't tried Y? 

Similarly MOUTH: M? 

But we can guess MOUTH? 

Perhaps consider: if the word is YOUTH? Then Y is tested? 

But I think both are fine? 

But we'll guess MOUTH? 

Alternatively, we can think: originally? We started? But I think MOUTH is common? 

So I'll go with MOUTH? 

But because TOUGH? We have T,U,H? And only position1 and4? Position4 must be T? So secret word is ?OUTH? with ? being M,Y, or P? 

But let me pick MOUTH? 

So <guess>MOUTH</guess> 

But in the thought? Let me write.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, eliminating these letters.
2. **Guess 2 (HOIST)**:
   - H is present but not in position 1 (yellow, wrong position).
   - O is correct and in position 2 (green).
   - I and S are absent (gray).
   - T is present but not in position 5 (yellow).
   
   This reveals:
   - The word has O in position 2 (pattern: _ O _ _ _).
   - H and T are in the word, but H is not in position 1, and T is not in position 5.
   - Eliminates I and S.

3. **Guess 3 (TOUGH)**:
   - T is present but not in position 1 (yellow, wrong position).
   - O is correct in position 2 (green).
   - U is correct in position 3 (green).
   - G is absent (gray).
   - H is correct in position 5 (green).

   This confirms:
   - The pattern is _ O U _ H.
   - U is fixed in position 3, and H is fixed in position 5.
   - T is in the word but cannot be in position 1 (already tested) or position 5 (H is there). Position 3 is occupied by U, leaving position 4 as the only possible location for T.
   - Eliminates G.

**Deductions**:
- The word must be ? O U ? H → ? O U T H (since T must be in position 4).
- Position 1 must be one of the remaining unexcluded letters (eliminated: C, R, A, N, E, I, S, G).
- Valid English words fitting this pattern and avoiding excluded letters: **MOUTH**, **YOUTH**, **POUTH** (rare but valid), **LOUTH** (rare), etc. Common options are MOUTH and YOUTH.
- For the next guess, **MOUTH** is selected as a tested common word. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal if the first letter is correct or if an alternative like YOUTH is needed.

<guess>MOUTH</guess>",MOUTH,"We have the following information:
1. From Guess 1 (CRANE): C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. From Guess 2 (HOIST):
   - H is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as '-')
   - O is in the correct position (position 2, so the word is _ O _ _ _)
   - I and S are not in the word (x)
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in position 5 and marked '-')
3. From Guess 3 (TOUGH):
   - T is in the word but not in position 1 (since we guessed T in position 1 and got '-')
   - O is correct in position 2 (✓)
   - U is correct in position 3 (✓) because we got '✓' for U in position 3. So now we know the word has O in position 2 and U in position 3: so the pattern is _ O U _ _
   - G is not in the word (x)
   - H is correct in position 5 (✓). Therefore, the secret word ends with H: _ O U _ H

So the secret word must be in the form: ? O U ? H

We also know the word contains T (from HOIST) and T is not in position 1 (from TOUGH) and not in position 5 (from HOIST, and position 5 is H). So T must be in position 4? Because positions: 1: ?, 2: O, 3: U, 4: ?, 5: H. Since T must be in the word and cannot be in 1 or 5, and we haven't placed it yet? We tried T in position 1 (in TOUGH) and it was wrong, and position 5 is H? So T must be in position 4? Or could it be in position 4? Because we haven't tried T in position 4? Let's see:

In HOIST, T was in position 5? And it was '-'. Then in TOUGH, T was in position 1? And it was '-'. So the only position left for T is either 3 or 4? But position 3 is U? Because from TOUGH U is in position 3. So we cannot put T in position 3? Because U is fixed there.

Therefore, T must be in position 4? Only possibility? Since positions 3 and 5 are taken by U and H? And 2 by O? So the word is _ O U _ H, and T must be in position 4? Because it must be in the word? And cannot be in 1, because TOUGH guessed T there? And cannot be in 5? And 3 is U? So yes, T must be in position 4.

But let's double-check: the positions we have:
Position 1: unknown letter
Position 2: O
Position 3: U
Position 4: must be T? Because T is in the word? And we've tried position 1 and 5? And position 3 is occupied? So position 4 is the only spot? Yes.

Therefore, the secret word is ? O U T H? Because T in position 4 and U in 3? Then ? O U T H? Position 1 is unknown? And 5:H? So format: [letter]OUTH?

But we also have H in position 5? Which matches.

Now, what letters can be in position 1? It must be a letter not excluded? And we know G is excluded? Because in TOUGH, G was 'x'? So G is excluded? Also excluded: C,R,A,N,E,I,S,G (from previous exclusions).

We must avoid: C,R,A,N,E,I,S,G.

Also from HOIST: I and S excluded? From CRANE: C,R,A,N,E? From TOUGH: G excluded.

Now, remaining letters: available letters are B, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? And we need a 5-letter word that ends with OUTH? But O,U,T,H fixed? So only first letter varies.

But the pattern must be [letter]OUTH? So the only one possibility? But we need to list words:

Common words: 
- MOUTH: M O U T H -> available? M is allowed? Not excluded.
- YOUTH: Y O U T H
- SOUTH: but S is excluded? S from HOIST: 'x'. So invalid.
- LOUTH: not common? probably not a valid word? or rare?
- ROUTH: R excluded? R from CRANE: excluded? No.
- POUTH: P O U T H -> P is allowed? Not excluded? POUTH is a word? Meaning: a pouter pigeon? Or a Scottish word for a poath? Rare? But might be accepted? 
- DOUTH: also rare? doubt word? 
- FOUTH: not a word?
- KOUTH: not a word?
- ZOUTH: not a word?

Therefore, probably the common words are MOUTH and YOUTH? And POUTH?

But MOUTH: M not excluded? YOUTH: Y not excluded? Etc.

We now know that the word must be ?OUTH? And we have M and Y as possibilities? Also B? But BOUTH? B O U T H? Is BOUTH a word? Not standard? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely either MOUTH or YOUTH? Or POUTH? 

But POUTH might be less common? 

We need to guess? We have two tries? Or one?

But to confirm: if we guess MOUTH, we get: M in position 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in4, H in5? Then feedback would be all correct? Or if wrong? Maybe.

But according to the feedback? We get ? O U T H? With first letter unknown? Because in TOUGH? We have O,U,H correct? U in position 3? H in 5? O in 2? But T not in1? So position4 must be T?

But in MOUTH? M: letter we haven't tried? 

Similarly for others? 

We have to guess one? Let's choose MOUTH?

To finish? We guess MOUTH?
