We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R, C, N.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me try to come up with a word that uses T, S, L, I, O, etc.

 Example: ""TOILS"" - but let's check if it has any of the forbidden letters: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in [C, R, A, N, E]. So that's a candidate.

 However, we might want to cover more common letters. Another option: ""SLIPT"" (but that's not very common). 

 Alternatively, we can use ""POINT"" but note that we cannot use N (because it was in the first guess and was marked absent). So ""POINT"" is invalid because of N.

 Let's try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the forbidden set.

 Another common word: ""BUILD"" - but U and I are vowels, and B, L, D are consonants. However, we might want to cover more frequent letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to maximize the information we get. We should try to include as many common letters as possible that we haven't tried.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E): S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, etc.

 We can try a word that has S, T, L, O, and I? But that's 5 letters: for example, ""TOILS"" (as above) or ""SLOTH"".

 ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. This covers 5 new common letters.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" is less common and we might avoid rare letters.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This has U which is less common, but it's acceptable.

 However, we might prefer to use a word with more common consonants. Let's consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. F is less common, but it's acceptable.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try a word that covers common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and not in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" is not good because it has B and is not very common and also has U and M, but we can do better.

 Another common word: ""LUCKY"" - but we cannot use C (from the first guess) and Y is a semi-vowel. So invalid because of C.

 After reconsideration, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we have to avoid E, A, R, C, N. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   M: not in forbidden
   O: not in forbidden
   I: not in forbidden
   S: not in forbidden
   T: not in forbidden

 Therefore, ""MOIST"" is valid.

After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. 

I considered words with high-frequency unused letters like S, T, L, O, I, M, P, B, H, and G. After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" is invalid (contains N, which is excluded).
- ""SLATE"" is invalid (contains A and E).
- ""BUILD"" is possible but less ideal (U is less common).
- ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T—all new, common letters, and avoids the excluded set.

""MOIST"" efficiently tests five new letters, maximizing information gain for the next guess.

- The third letter of the secret word is I.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but Y can be a consonant too). We also have the vowel I, but it's already fixed in position 3.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting the word.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y.

We can consider words like:
- Ending with I: but we need I in the middle.
- Examples: 
  - BUILD: but B, U, I, L, D -> but U and L are available? Let's check: 
      B: available, U: available, I: fixed at position 3, L: available, D: available.
      However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD contains U, I, L, D, B. None of these are forbidden? 
      But wait, we have to check: 
        B: not forbidden? (forbidden are A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T) -> yes, B is allowed.
        U: allowed.
        I: allowed and fixed.
        L: allowed.
        D: allowed.
      So BUILD is a candidate. However, note that in the feedback for ""moist"", I was correct, but the other letters were absent. So we can use BUILD.

  But wait, let's see if BUILD is a valid word. Yes, it is.

  However, we must consider that we have only 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Since we know the third letter is I, we can try to cover more common letters.

  Another candidate: ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D. Similarly, G is allowed.

  But note: we don't know if U or L or D are in the word. We might want to test multiple new letters.

  Another idea: ""JUMPY"" -> J, U, M, P, Y. But M is forbidden (from the feedback of moist: M is absent). So we cannot use M.

  Correction: M is forbidden, so we must avoid M.

  Let me list some words with I in the third position and using only available letters:

  - BUILD: positions 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - GUILD: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - QUAIL: but Q, U, A, I, L -> A is forbidden (from crane feedback: A absent). So invalid.
  - FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, D are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, I: fixed, D: allowed. So FLUID is a candidate.
  - JUICE: J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are forbidden. Invalid.
  - PLUMB: P, L, U, M, B -> M is forbidden. Invalid.
  - BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> M forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DIVVY"" -> D, I, V, V, Y -> but I is in position 3? We need I at position 3. So: 
      If we put D at 1, I at 2? No, we need I at 3. So we can have: _ _ I _ _ -> so DIVVY would require I at position 2? No, it's D-I-V-V-Y, so I is at position 2. Not matching.

  We need the third letter to be I.

  How about ""SKIMP""? But S and M are forbidden.

  ""THIGH""? T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""CHILL""? C and H: C is forbidden, H is allowed? But C is forbidden, so no.

  ""WHISK""? W, H, I, S, K -> S is forbidden. Invalid.

  ""FLICK""? F, L, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? B, L, I, N, K -> N is forbidden.

  So let's stick with BUILD, GUILD, or FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUICK""? Q, U, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""JUICE"" has C and E, forbidden.

  ""BUILT""? B, U, I, L, T -> T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""BUYER""? B, U, Y, E, R -> E and R are forbidden.

  ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUID"" seems good: F, L, U, I, D.

  Another: ""GLIDE""? G, L, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""PRIDE""? P, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""BRIDE""? B, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""SLIDE""? S and E forbidden.

  ""ABIDE""? A and E forbidden.

  So we have BUILD, GUILD, FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUIP?"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

  ""SQUIB""? S is forbidden.

  ""BUOYS""? B, U, O, Y, S -> O and S forbidden.

  ""BUFFY""? B, U, F, F, Y -> F and Y are allowed. But we have two F's? And the pattern: 
      Position 1: B, 2: U, 3: I (must be I) -> so we cannot have B,U,F,F,Y because the third letter must be I. So we need to have I at position 3.

  Therefore, the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4][letter5]

  So for ""BUFFY"", it doesn't have I at position 3.

  How about ""BUDDY""? B, U, D, D, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  So we must have a word with I in the middle.

  Another candidate: ""BLUFF""? B, L, U, F, F -> no I.

  We must have I at position 3.

  So let's list words that have I as the third letter and use only the available letters.

  We have:
    BUILD: B, U, I, L, D
    GUILD: G, U, I, L, D
    FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> wait, in FLUID, the third letter is U? Let's check: F-L-U-I-D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D -> so I is at position 4, not 3. So that doesn't work.

  Correction: We need the third letter to be I. So in FLUID, the third letter is U, not I. So invalid.

  How about ""BLISS""? But S is forbidden and also I is at position 3? B-L-I-S-S -> yes, I at 3. But S is forbidden (from moist: S absent). So invalid.

  ""FLING""? F, L, I, N, G -> N is forbidden.

  ""FLINT""? F, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""GLINT""? G, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""BLIMP""? M forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? N forbidden.

  ""BLITZ""? B, L, I, T, Z -> T forbidden.

  ""BLIND""? N forbidden.

  ""BLIPS""? S forbidden.

  ""BLIVE""? Not a word? And E forbidden.

  ""BLUER""? E and R forbidden.

  ""BLUES""? E and S forbidden.

  ""BLUID""? This is a variant of BLOOD? Not standard. But let's see: B, L, U, I, D -> but then the third letter is U, not I. So no.

  We need the third letter to be I. So the word must be: [consonant?][vowel?]I[consonant][consonant] or similar.

  Another idea: ""PIQUE""? P, I, Q, U, E -> but I is at position 2, not 3. And E forbidden.

  ""ADIEU""? A and E forbidden.

  ""OILED""? O and E forbidden.

  ""MINCE""? M, I, N, C, E -> all of M, N, C, E are forbidden.

  We are having trouble. Let me think of words with I in the third position.

  Common words: 
    CHAIR -> C and H: C forbidden.
    TRAIN -> T, R, A, I, N -> T, R, A, N forbidden.
    PLAIN -> P, L, A, I, N -> A and N forbidden.
    BLAME -> B, L, A, M, E -> A, M, E forbidden.

  How about ""QUILL""? Q, U, I, L, L -> but we have two L's. And the pattern: Q-U-I-L-L -> third letter is I. 
      Letters: Q, U, I, L. 
      Check forbidden: Q: allowed? (not in forbidden list), U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we have two L's? That's acceptable if the word has double letters? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

  But note: in the feedback, we only get per letter, and if a letter is duplicated and one is in the word, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we haven't seen L yet.

  So ""QUILL"" is a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SQUID""? S is forbidden.

  ""GUIDE""? G, U, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""QUIET""? Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T forbidden.

  ""QUIRK""? Q, U, I, R, K -> R forbidden.

  ""QUIPU""? Q, U, I, P, U -> two U's? And U is allowed. But is it a word? It's a device used by the Incas. Might be accepted.

  But let's stick to more common words.

  ""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are common. And ""QUILL"" is also common.

  We also have ""BUILT"", but T is forbidden.

  Another: ""GUILT"" -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUFF""? No I.

  ""JUICE"" -> C and E forbidden.

  ""JUICY"" -> C forbidden.

  ""BLUFF"" -> no I.

  ""PLUMB"" -> M forbidden.

  So our candidates are: BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  We can also consider ""BULKY""? B, U, L, K, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIDDY""? B, I, D, D, Y -> I at position 2, not 3.

  ""DIZZY""? D, I, Z, Z, Y -> I at position 2.

  We must have I at position 3.

  Another candidate: ""KILIM""? K, I, L, I, M -> M forbidden and also I is at position 2 and 4? The pattern: K-I-L-I-M -> third letter is L, not I. So no.

  ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> O and T forbidden.

  ""PILAF""? P, I, L, A, F -> A forbidden.

  ""PILED""? P, I, L, E, D -> E forbidden.

  ""WIELD""? W, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""FIELD""? F, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""YIELD""? Y, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""HILLY""? H, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2? H-I-L-L-Y -> third letter is L.

  So we are back to BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  Let me check the dictionary: 
    BUILD: valid
    GUILD: valid
    QUILL: valid

  We can choose one. Since we want to test more common consonants, let's pick BUILD because it has B and D, which are common.

  But note: we have to consider that we are on the third guess and we have limited tries. We might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

  BUILD has no repeated letters. Similarly, GUILD has no repeated letters. QUILL has two L's, so it tests fewer distinct letters.

  So between BUILD and GUILD, which one? They share U, I, L, D. The only difference is the first letter: B vs G.

  We don't have information about either. We might choose one arbitrarily.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we haven't tested at all. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

  We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  In BUILD, we test B, U, I, L, D. We already know I is in the word, so we are testing B, U, L, D.

  In GUILD, we test G, U, I, L, D -> testing G, U, L, D.

  We might also consider a word that doesn't have U, because U is less common? But we have to use the available letters.

  Another candidate: ""PHYLA""? P, H, Y, L, A -> A forbidden.

  ""LYMPH""? M forbidden.

  ""WIGHT""? W, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""LIGHT""? L, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""NIGHT""? N and T forbidden.

  ""RIGHT""? R and T forbidden.

  ""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""DIGHT""? Not common.

  ""PILCH""? Not common.

  We are limited.

  Let's try to find a word that has I in the third position and uses H, which is common.

  ""WHICH""? W, H, I, C, H -> C forbidden.

  ""THICK""? T, H, I, C, K -> T and C forbidden.

  ""SHINY""? S forbidden.

  ""CHINA""? C and A forbidden.

  So H is hard to test.

  Another idea: ""JUICE"" is invalid.

  ""QUICK"" invalid.

  ""BLINK"" invalid.

  So I think BUILD or GUILD are our best bets.

  Let me choose BUILD because B is more common than G? Actually, in English, G is also common.

  But to decide, note that we have not tested B, D, G, etc. We can choose BUILD and then if it's wrong, we still have G to test.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both B and G? But we need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIGLY""? B, I, G, L, Y -> but then I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.

  ""BOGIE""? B, O, G, I, E -> O and E forbidden.

  ""BAGGY""? A and G: A forbidden.

  So I think we go with BUILD.

  But wait, we have another candidate: ""QUIPU"" we discarded because it's less common, but let's check: Q, U, I, P, U -> third letter is I? Q-U-I-P-U -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:U. So yes, I at position 3. And letters: Q, U, I, P. We have two U's? But that's acceptable. However, it's not a very common word.

  We should stick to common words.

  Therefore, I choose ""BUILD"".

  But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD: B, U, I, L, D. None of these are in the forbidden set.

  So let's guess ""BUILD"".

  However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""GUILD"", then we are close, but we are testing B instead of G.

  But that's okay because we get information.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use U? Because U is less common. But we don't have many options.

  Another candidate: ""FLYBY""? F, L, Y, B, Y -> no I.

  ""DIVVY"" -> no I at position 3.

  ""BILLY""? B, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2.

  ""HILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""WILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""FILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""PILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  We need I at position 3.

  ""AXIOM"" -> A and O forbidden.

  ""EXIST"" -> E and S and T forbidden.

  ""IONIC"" -> I at position 1? I-O-N-I-C -> I at 1 and 4. But N and C forbidden.

  So I think BUILD is a reasonable guess.

  Let's go with ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" had only the letter ""I"" correct and in position 3 (M, O, S, T absent).

The secret word must:
- Have ""I"" as the third letter.
- Exclude all previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., avoiding forbidden letters and placing ""I"" in position 3), ""BUILD"" is a valid guess. It uses new common letters (B, U, L, D) and tests plausible combinations while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>build</guess>",build,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since I is the third letter).
   - M, O, S, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is I.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter.
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Let's list the available letters. We have to avoid: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

Available vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but Y can be a consonant too). We also have the vowel I, but it's already fixed in position 3.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting the word.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y.

We can consider words like:
- Ending with I: but we need I in the middle.
- Examples: 
  - BUILD: but B, U, I, L, D -> but U and L are available? Let's check: 
      B: available, U: available, I: fixed at position 3, L: available, D: available.
      However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD contains U, I, L, D, B. None of these are forbidden? 
      But wait, we have to check: 
        B: not forbidden? (forbidden are A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T) -> yes, B is allowed.
        U: allowed.
        I: allowed and fixed.
        L: allowed.
        D: allowed.
      So BUILD is a candidate. However, note that in the feedback for ""moist"", I was correct, but the other letters were absent. So we can use BUILD.

  But wait, let's see if BUILD is a valid word. Yes, it is.

  However, we must consider that we have only 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Since we know the third letter is I, we can try to cover more common letters.

  Another candidate: ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D. Similarly, G is allowed.

  But note: we don't know if U or L or D are in the word. We might want to test multiple new letters.

  Another idea: ""JUMPY"" -> J, U, M, P, Y. But M is forbidden (from the feedback of moist: M is absent). So we cannot use M.

  Correction: M is forbidden, so we must avoid M.

  Let me list some words with I in the third position and using only available letters:

  - BUILD: positions 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - GUILD: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - QUAIL: but Q, U, A, I, L -> A is forbidden (from crane feedback: A absent). So invalid.
  - FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, D are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, I: fixed, D: allowed. So FLUID is a candidate.
  - JUICE: J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are forbidden. Invalid.
  - PLUMB: P, L, U, M, B -> M is forbidden. Invalid.
  - BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> M forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DIVVY"" -> D, I, V, V, Y -> but I is in position 3? We need I at position 3. So: 
      If we put D at 1, I at 2? No, we need I at 3. So we can have: _ _ I _ _ -> so DIVVY would require I at position 2? No, it's D-I-V-V-Y, so I is at position 2. Not matching.

  We need the third letter to be I.

  How about ""SKIMP""? But S and M are forbidden.

  ""THIGH""? T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""CHILL""? C and H: C is forbidden, H is allowed? But C is forbidden, so no.

  ""WHISK""? W, H, I, S, K -> S is forbidden. Invalid.

  ""FLICK""? F, L, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? B, L, I, N, K -> N is forbidden.

  So let's stick with BUILD, GUILD, or FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUICK""? Q, U, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""JUICE"" has C and E, forbidden.

  ""BUILT""? B, U, I, L, T -> T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""BUYER""? B, U, Y, E, R -> E and R are forbidden.

  ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUID"" seems good: F, L, U, I, D.

  Another: ""GLIDE""? G, L, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""PRIDE""? P, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""BRIDE""? B, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""SLIDE""? S and E forbidden.

  ""ABIDE""? A and E forbidden.

  So we have BUILD, GUILD, FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUIP?"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

  ""SQUIB""? S is forbidden.

  ""BUOYS""? B, U, O, Y, S -> O and S forbidden.

  ""BUFFY""? B, U, F, F, Y -> F and Y are allowed. But we have two F's? And the pattern: 
      Position 1: B, 2: U, 3: I (must be I) -> so we cannot have B,U,F,F,Y because the third letter must be I. So we need to have I at position 3.

  Therefore, the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4][letter5]

  So for ""BUFFY"", it doesn't have I at position 3.

  How about ""BUDDY""? B, U, D, D, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  So we must have a word with I in the middle.

  Another candidate: ""BLUFF""? B, L, U, F, F -> no I.

  We must have I at position 3.

  So let's list words that have I as the third letter and use only the available letters.

  We have:
    BUILD: B, U, I, L, D
    GUILD: G, U, I, L, D
    FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> wait, in FLUID, the third letter is U? Let's check: F-L-U-I-D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D -> so I is at position 4, not 3. So that doesn't work.

  Correction: We need the third letter to be I. So in FLUID, the third letter is U, not I. So invalid.

  How about ""BLISS""? But S is forbidden and also I is at position 3? B-L-I-S-S -> yes, I at 3. But S is forbidden (from moist: S absent). So invalid.

  ""FLING""? F, L, I, N, G -> N is forbidden.

  ""FLINT""? F, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""GLINT""? G, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""BLIMP""? M forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? N forbidden.

  ""BLITZ""? B, L, I, T, Z -> T forbidden.

  ""BLIND""? N forbidden.

  ""BLIPS""? S forbidden.

  ""BLIVE""? Not a word? And E forbidden.

  ""BLUER""? E and R forbidden.

  ""BLUES""? E and S forbidden.

  ""BLUID""? This is a variant of BLOOD? Not standard. But let's see: B, L, U, I, D -> but then the third letter is U, not I. So no.

  We need the third letter to be I. So the word must be: [consonant?][vowel?]I[consonant][consonant] or similar.

  Another idea: ""PIQUE""? P, I, Q, U, E -> but I is at position 2, not 3. And E forbidden.

  ""ADIEU""? A and E forbidden.

  ""OILED""? O and E forbidden.

  ""MINCE""? M, I, N, C, E -> all of M, N, C, E are forbidden.

  We are having trouble. Let me think of words with I in the third position.

  Common words: 
    CHAIR -> C and H: C forbidden.
    TRAIN -> T, R, A, I, N -> T, R, A, N forbidden.
    PLAIN -> P, L, A, I, N -> A and N forbidden.
    BLAME -> B, L, A, M, E -> A, M, E forbidden.

  How about ""QUILL""? Q, U, I, L, L -> but we have two L's. And the pattern: Q-U-I-L-L -> third letter is I. 
      Letters: Q, U, I, L. 
      Check forbidden: Q: allowed? (not in forbidden list), U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we have two L's? That's acceptable if the word has double letters? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

  But note: in the feedback, we only get per letter, and if a letter is duplicated and one is in the word, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we haven't seen L yet.

  So ""QUILL"" is a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SQUID""? S is forbidden.

  ""GUIDE""? G, U, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""QUIET""? Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T forbidden.

  ""QUIRK""? Q, U, I, R, K -> R forbidden.

  ""QUIPU""? Q, U, I, P, U -> two U's? And U is allowed. But is it a word? It's a device used by the Incas. Might be accepted.

  But let's stick to more common words.

  ""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are common. And ""QUILL"" is also common.

  We also have ""BUILT"", but T is forbidden.

  Another: ""GUILT"" -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUFF""? No I.

  ""JUICE"" -> C and E forbidden.

  ""JUICY"" -> C forbidden.

  ""BLUFF"" -> no I.

  ""PLUMB"" -> M forbidden.

  So our candidates are: BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  We can also consider ""BULKY""? B, U, L, K, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIDDY""? B, I, D, D, Y -> I at position 2, not 3.

  ""DIZZY""? D, I, Z, Z, Y -> I at position 2.

  We must have I at position 3.

  Another candidate: ""KILIM""? K, I, L, I, M -> M forbidden and also I is at position 2 and 4? The pattern: K-I-L-I-M -> third letter is L, not I. So no.

  ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> O and T forbidden.

  ""PILAF""? P, I, L, A, F -> A forbidden.

  ""PILED""? P, I, L, E, D -> E forbidden.

  ""WIELD""? W, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""FIELD""? F, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""YIELD""? Y, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""HILLY""? H, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2? H-I-L-L-Y -> third letter is L.

  So we are back to BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  Let me check the dictionary: 
    BUILD: valid
    GUILD: valid
    QUILL: valid

  We can choose one. Since we want to test more common consonants, let's pick BUILD because it has B and D, which are common.

  But note: we have to consider that we are on the third guess and we have limited tries. We might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

  BUILD has no repeated letters. Similarly, GUILD has no repeated letters. QUILL has two L's, so it tests fewer distinct letters.

  So between BUILD and GUILD, which one? They share U, I, L, D. The only difference is the first letter: B vs G.

  We don't have information about either. We might choose one arbitrarily.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we haven't tested at all. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

  We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  In BUILD, we test B, U, I, L, D. We already know I is in the word, so we are testing B, U, L, D.

  In GUILD, we test G, U, I, L, D -> testing G, U, L, D.

  We might also consider a word that doesn't have U, because U is less common? But we have to use the available letters.

  Another candidate: ""PHYLA""? P, H, Y, L, A -> A forbidden.

  ""LYMPH""? M forbidden.

  ""WIGHT""? W, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""LIGHT""? L, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""NIGHT""? N and T forbidden.

  ""RIGHT""? R and T forbidden.

  ""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""DIGHT""? Not common.

  ""PILCH""? Not common.

  We are limited.

  Let's try to find a word that has I in the third position and uses H, which is common.

  ""WHICH""? W, H, I, C, H -> C forbidden.

  ""THICK""? T, H, I, C, K -> T and C forbidden.

  ""SHINY""? S forbidden.

  ""CHINA""? C and A forbidden.

  So H is hard to test.

  Another idea: ""JUICE"" is invalid.

  ""QUICK"" invalid.

  ""BLINK"" invalid.

  So I think BUILD or GUILD are our best bets.

  Let me choose BUILD because B is more common than G? Actually, in English, G is also common.

  But to decide, note that we have not tested B, D, G, etc. We can choose BUILD and then if it's wrong, we still have G to test.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both B and G? But we need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIGLY""? B, I, G, L, Y -> but then I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.

  ""BOGIE""? B, O, G, I, E -> O and E forbidden.

  ""BAGGY""? A and G: A forbidden.

  So I think we go with BUILD.

  But wait, we have another candidate: ""QUIPU"" we discarded because it's less common, but let's check: Q, U, I, P, U -> third letter is I? Q-U-I-P-U -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:U. So yes, I at position 3. And letters: Q, U, I, P. We have two U's? But that's acceptable. However, it's not a very common word.

  We should stick to common words.

  Therefore, I choose ""BUILD"".

  But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD: B, U, I, L, D. None of these are in the forbidden set.

  So let's guess ""BUILD"".

  However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""GUILD"", then we are close, but we are testing B instead of G.

  But that's okay because we get information.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use U? Because U is less common. But we don't have many options.

  Another candidate: ""FLYBY""? F, L, Y, B, Y -> no I.

  ""DIVVY"" -> no I at position 3.

  ""BILLY""? B, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2.

  ""HILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""WILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""FILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""PILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  We need I at position 3.

  ""AXIOM"" -> A and O forbidden.

  ""EXIST"" -> E and S and T forbidden.

  ""IONIC"" -> I at position 1? I-O-N-I-C -> I at 1 and 4. But N and C forbidden.

  So I think BUILD is a reasonable guess.

  Let's go with ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" had only the letter ""I"" correct and in position 3 (M, O, S, T absent).

The secret word must:
- Have ""I"" as the third letter.
- Exclude all previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., avoiding forbidden letters and placing ""I"" in position 3), ""BUILD"" is a valid guess. It uses new common letters (B, U, L, D) and tests plausible combinations while adhering to the feedback.",Guess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,GUILD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R, C, N.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with common letters that we haven't tried.

 Let me try to come up with a word that uses T, S, L, I, O, etc.

 Example: ""TOILS"" - but let's check if it has any of the forbidden letters: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in [C, R, A, N, E]. So that's a candidate.

 However, we might want to cover more common letters. Another option: ""SLIPT"" (but that's not very common). 

 Alternatively, we can use ""POINT"" but note that we cannot use N (because it was in the first guess and was marked absent). So ""POINT"" is invalid because of N.

 Let's try ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. None of these are in the forbidden set.

 Another common word: ""BUILD"" - but U and I are vowels, and B, L, D are consonants. However, we might want to cover more frequent letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to maximize the information we get. We should try to include as many common letters as possible that we haven't tried.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E): S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, etc.

 We can try a word that has S, T, L, O, and I? But that's 5 letters: for example, ""TOILS"" (as above) or ""SLOTH"".

 ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. This covers 5 new common letters.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" is less common and we might avoid rare letters.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This has U which is less common, but it's acceptable.

 However, we might prefer to use a word with more common consonants. Let's consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. F is less common, but it's acceptable.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try a word that covers common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and not in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" is not good because it has B and is not very common and also has U and M, but we can do better.

 Another common word: ""LUCKY"" - but we cannot use C (from the first guess) and Y is a semi-vowel. So invalid because of C.

 After reconsideration, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we have to avoid E, A, R, C, N. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   M: not in forbidden
   O: not in forbidden
   I: not in forbidden
   S: not in forbidden
   T: not in forbidden

 Therefore, ""MOIST"" is valid.

<guess>moist</guess>After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. The goal is to test new common letters to gather more information. 

I considered words with high-frequency unused letters like S, T, L, O, I, M, P, B, H, and G. After evaluating options:
- ""POINT"" is invalid (contains N, which is excluded).
- ""SLATE"" is invalid (contains A and E).
- ""BUILD"" is possible but less ideal (U is less common).
- ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T—all new, common letters, and avoids the excluded set.

""MOIST"" efficiently tests five new letters, maximizing information gain for the next guess.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since I is the third letter).
   - M, O, S, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The third letter of the secret word is I.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has 'I' as the third letter.
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Let's list the available letters. We have to avoid: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

Available vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but Y can be a consonant too). We also have the vowel I, but it's already fixed in position 3.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ I _ _

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting the word.

Common letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, Y.

We can consider words like:
- Ending with I: but we need I in the middle.
- Examples: 
  - BUILD: but B, U, I, L, D -> but U and L are available? Let's check: 
      B: available, U: available, I: fixed at position 3, L: available, D: available.
      However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD contains U, I, L, D, B. None of these are forbidden? 
      But wait, we have to check: 
        B: not forbidden? (forbidden are A,C,E,M,N,O,R,S,T) -> yes, B is allowed.
        U: allowed.
        I: allowed and fixed.
        L: allowed.
        D: allowed.
      So BUILD is a candidate. However, note that in the feedback for ""moist"", I was correct, but the other letters were absent. So we can use BUILD.

  But wait, let's see if BUILD is a valid word. Yes, it is.

  However, we must consider that we have only 6 tries and we want to maximize information. Since we know the third letter is I, we can try to cover more common letters.

  Another candidate: ""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D. Similarly, G is allowed.

  But note: we don't know if U or L or D are in the word. We might want to test multiple new letters.

  Another idea: ""JUMPY"" -> J, U, M, P, Y. But M is forbidden (from the feedback of moist: M is absent). So we cannot use M.

  Correction: M is forbidden, so we must avoid M.

  Let me list some words with I in the third position and using only available letters:

  - BUILD: positions 1:B, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - GUILD: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D
  - QUAIL: but Q, U, A, I, L -> A is forbidden (from crane feedback: A absent). So invalid.
  - FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> F, L, U, D are allowed? 
      F: allowed, L: allowed, U: allowed, I: fixed, D: allowed. So FLUID is a candidate.
  - JUICE: J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are forbidden. Invalid.
  - PLUMB: P, L, U, M, B -> M is forbidden. Invalid.
  - BLIMP: B, L, I, M, P -> M forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DIVVY"" -> D, I, V, V, Y -> but I is in position 3? We need I at position 3. So: 
      If we put D at 1, I at 2? No, we need I at 3. So we can have: _ _ I _ _ -> so DIVVY would require I at position 2? No, it's D-I-V-V-Y, so I is at position 2. Not matching.

  We need the third letter to be I.

  How about ""SKIMP""? But S and M are forbidden.

  ""THIGH""? T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""CHILL""? C and H: C is forbidden, H is allowed? But C is forbidden, so no.

  ""WHISK""? W, H, I, S, K -> S is forbidden. Invalid.

  ""FLICK""? F, L, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? B, L, I, N, K -> N is forbidden.

  So let's stick with BUILD, GUILD, or FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUICK""? Q, U, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.

  ""JUICE"" has C and E, forbidden.

  ""BUILT""? B, U, I, L, T -> T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.

  ""BUYER""? B, U, Y, E, R -> E and R are forbidden.

  ""GUILT""? G, U, I, L, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUID"" seems good: F, L, U, I, D.

  Another: ""GLIDE""? G, L, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""PRIDE""? P, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""BRIDE""? B, R, I, D, E -> R and E forbidden.

  ""SLIDE""? S and E forbidden.

  ""ABIDE""? A and E forbidden.

  So we have BUILD, GUILD, FLUID.

  We can also consider ""QUIP?"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

  ""SQUIB""? S is forbidden.

  ""BUOYS""? B, U, O, Y, S -> O and S forbidden.

  ""BUFFY""? B, U, F, F, Y -> F and Y are allowed. But we have two F's? And the pattern: 
      Position 1: B, 2: U, 3: I (must be I) -> so we cannot have B,U,F,F,Y because the third letter must be I. So we need to have I at position 3.

  Therefore, the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4][letter5]

  So for ""BUFFY"", it doesn't have I at position 3.

  How about ""BUDDY""? B, U, D, D, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  So we must have a word with I in the middle.

  Another candidate: ""BLUFF""? B, L, U, F, F -> no I.

  We must have I at position 3.

  So let's list words that have I as the third letter and use only the available letters.

  We have:
    BUILD: B, U, I, L, D
    GUILD: G, U, I, L, D
    FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> wait, in FLUID, the third letter is U? Let's check: F-L-U-I-D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D -> so I is at position 4, not 3. So that doesn't work.

  Correction: We need the third letter to be I. So in FLUID, the third letter is U, not I. So invalid.

  How about ""BLISS""? But S is forbidden and also I is at position 3? B-L-I-S-S -> yes, I at 3. But S is forbidden (from moist: S absent). So invalid.

  ""FLING""? F, L, I, N, G -> N is forbidden.

  ""FLINT""? F, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""GLINT""? G, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.

  ""BLIMP""? M forbidden.

  ""BLINK""? N forbidden.

  ""BLITZ""? B, L, I, T, Z -> T forbidden.

  ""BLIND""? N forbidden.

  ""BLIPS""? S forbidden.

  ""BLIVE""? Not a word? And E forbidden.

  ""BLUER""? E and R forbidden.

  ""BLUES""? E and S forbidden.

  ""BLUID""? This is a variant of BLOOD? Not standard. But let's see: B, L, U, I, D -> but then the third letter is U, not I. So no.

  We need the third letter to be I. So the word must be: [consonant?][vowel?]I[consonant][consonant] or similar.

  Another idea: ""PIQUE""? P, I, Q, U, E -> but I is at position 2, not 3. And E forbidden.

  ""ADIEU""? A and E forbidden.

  ""OILED""? O and E forbidden.

  ""MINCE""? M, I, N, C, E -> all of M, N, C, E are forbidden.

  We are having trouble. Let me think of words with I in the third position.

  Common words: 
    CHAIR -> C and H: C forbidden.
    TRAIN -> T, R, A, I, N -> T, R, A, N forbidden.
    PLAIN -> P, L, A, I, N -> A and N forbidden.
    BLAME -> B, L, A, M, E -> A, M, E forbidden.

  How about ""QUILL""? Q, U, I, L, L -> but we have two L's. And the pattern: Q-U-I-L-L -> third letter is I. 
      Letters: Q, U, I, L. 
      Check forbidden: Q: allowed? (not in forbidden list), U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed. 
      But we have two L's? That's acceptable if the word has double letters? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. However, we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

  But note: in the feedback, we only get per letter, and if a letter is duplicated and one is in the word, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we haven't seen L yet.

  So ""QUILL"" is a candidate.

  Similarly, ""SQUID""? S is forbidden.

  ""GUIDE""? G, U, I, D, E -> E forbidden.

  ""QUIET""? Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T forbidden.

  ""QUIRK""? Q, U, I, R, K -> R forbidden.

  ""QUIPU""? Q, U, I, P, U -> two U's? And U is allowed. But is it a word? It's a device used by the Incas. Might be accepted.

  But let's stick to more common words.

  ""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are common. And ""QUILL"" is also common.

  We also have ""BUILT"", but T is forbidden.

  Another: ""GUILT"" -> T forbidden.

  ""FLUFF""? No I.

  ""JUICE"" -> C and E forbidden.

  ""JUICY"" -> C forbidden.

  ""BLUFF"" -> no I.

  ""PLUMB"" -> M forbidden.

  So our candidates are: BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  We can also consider ""BULKY""? B, U, L, K, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIDDY""? B, I, D, D, Y -> I at position 2, not 3.

  ""DIZZY""? D, I, Z, Z, Y -> I at position 2.

  We must have I at position 3.

  Another candidate: ""KILIM""? K, I, L, I, M -> M forbidden and also I is at position 2 and 4? The pattern: K-I-L-I-M -> third letter is L, not I. So no.

  ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> O and T forbidden.

  ""PILAF""? P, I, L, A, F -> A forbidden.

  ""PILED""? P, I, L, E, D -> E forbidden.

  ""WIELD""? W, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""FIELD""? F, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""YIELD""? Y, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.

  ""HILLY""? H, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2? H-I-L-L-Y -> third letter is L.

  So we are back to BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.

  Let me check the dictionary: 
    BUILD: valid
    GUILD: valid
    QUILL: valid

  We can choose one. Since we want to test more common consonants, let's pick BUILD because it has B and D, which are common.

  But note: we have to consider that we are on the third guess and we have limited tries. We might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.

  BUILD has no repeated letters. Similarly, GUILD has no repeated letters. QUILL has two L's, so it tests fewer distinct letters.

  So between BUILD and GUILD, which one? They share U, I, L, D. The only difference is the first letter: B vs G.

  We don't have information about either. We might choose one arbitrarily.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we haven't tested at all. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.

  We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  In BUILD, we test B, U, I, L, D. We already know I is in the word, so we are testing B, U, L, D.

  In GUILD, we test G, U, I, L, D -> testing G, U, L, D.

  We might also consider a word that doesn't have U, because U is less common? But we have to use the available letters.

  Another candidate: ""PHYLA""? P, H, Y, L, A -> A forbidden.

  ""LYMPH""? M forbidden.

  ""WIGHT""? W, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""LIGHT""? L, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""NIGHT""? N and T forbidden.

  ""RIGHT""? R and T forbidden.

  ""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.

  ""DIGHT""? Not common.

  ""PILCH""? Not common.

  We are limited.

  Let's try to find a word that has I in the third position and uses H, which is common.

  ""WHICH""? W, H, I, C, H -> C forbidden.

  ""THICK""? T, H, I, C, K -> T and C forbidden.

  ""SHINY""? S forbidden.

  ""CHINA""? C and A forbidden.

  So H is hard to test.

  Another idea: ""JUICE"" is invalid.

  ""QUICK"" invalid.

  ""BLINK"" invalid.

  So I think BUILD or GUILD are our best bets.

  Let me choose BUILD because B is more common than G? Actually, in English, G is also common.

  But to decide, note that we have not tested B, D, G, etc. We can choose BUILD and then if it's wrong, we still have G to test.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both B and G? But we need I at position 3.

  How about ""BIGLY""? B, I, G, L, Y -> but then I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.

  ""BOGIE""? B, O, G, I, E -> O and E forbidden.

  ""BAGGY""? A and G: A forbidden.

  So I think we go with BUILD.

  But wait, we have another candidate: ""QUIPU"" we discarded because it's less common, but let's check: Q, U, I, P, U -> third letter is I? Q-U-I-P-U -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:U. So yes, I at position 3. And letters: Q, U, I, P. We have two U's? But that's acceptable. However, it's not a very common word.

  We should stick to common words.

  Therefore, I choose ""BUILD"".

  But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD: B, U, I, L, D. None of these are in the forbidden set.

  So let's guess ""BUILD"".

  However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""GUILD"", then we are close, but we are testing B instead of G.

  But that's okay because we get information.

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't use U? Because U is less common. But we don't have many options.

  Another candidate: ""FLYBY""? F, L, Y, B, Y -> no I.

  ""DIVVY"" -> no I at position 3.

  ""BILLY""? B, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2.

  ""HILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""WILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""FILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  ""PILLY"" -> I at position 2.

  We need I at position 3.

  ""AXIOM"" -> A and O forbidden.

  ""EXIST"" -> E and S and T forbidden.

  ""IONIC"" -> I at position 1? I-O-N-I-C -> I at 1 and 4. But N and C forbidden.

  So I think BUILD is a reasonable guess.

  Let's go with ""BUILD"".

<guess>build</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- ""moist"" had only the letter ""I"" correct and in position 3 (M, O, S, T absent).

The secret word must:
- Have ""I"" as the third letter.
- Exclude all previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., avoiding forbidden letters and placing ""I"" in position 3), ""BUILD"" is a valid guess. It uses new common letters (B, U, L, D) and tests plausible combinations while adhering to the feedback.

We can consider other vowels and consonants.\n Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)\n Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R, C, N.\n\n Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\n A good starting point might be to use a word with common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let me try to come up with a word that uses T, S, L, I, O, etc.\n\n Example: ""TOILS"" - but let\'s check if it has any of the forbidden letters: T, O, I, L, S. None of these are in [C, R, A, N, E]. So that\'s a candidate.\n\n However, we might want to cover more common letters. Another option: ""SLIPT"" (but that\'s not very common). \n\n Alternatively, we can use ""POINT"" but note that we cannot use N (because it was in the first guess and was marked absent).

However, we might want to cover more frequent letters.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to maximize the information we get. We should try to include as many common letters as possible that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E): S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, B, H, G, K, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has S, T, L, O, and I? But that\'s 5 letters: for example, ""TOILS"" (as above) or ""SLOTH"".\n\n ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. This covers 5 new common letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" is less common and we might avoid rare letters.\n\n Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This has U which is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we might prefer to use a word with more common consonants. Let\'s consider ""SHIFT"": S, H, I, F, T. F is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to try a word that covers common letters.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and not in the forbidden set.\n\n Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" is not good because it has B and is not very common and also has U and M, but we can do better.\n\n Another common word: ""LUCKY"" - but we cannot use C (from the first guess) and Y is a semi-vowel. So invalid because of C.\n\n After reconsideration, I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we have to avoid E, A, R, C, N. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So I will go with ""MOIST"".\n\n However, let me double-check: \n   M: not in forbidden\n   O: not in forbidden\n   I: not in forbidden\n   S: not in forbidden\n   T: not in forbidden\n\n Therefore, ""MOIST"" is valid.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>After the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely.

Invalid.\n\n  Another: ""DIVVY"" -> D, I, V, V, Y -> but I is in position 3? We need I at position 3. So: \n      If we put D at 1, I at 2? No, we need I at 3. So we can have: _ _ I _ _ -> so DIVVY would require I at position 2? No, it\'s D-I-V-V-Y, so I is at position 2. Not matching.\n\n  We need the third letter to be I.\n\n  How about ""SKIMP""? But S and M are forbidden.\n\n  ""THIGH""? T is forbidden (from moist feedback: T absent). So invalid.\n\n  ""CHILL""? C and H: C is forbidden, H is allowed? But C is forbidden, so no.\n\n  ""WHISK""? W, H, I, S, K -> S is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n  ""FLICK""? F, L, I, C, K -> C is forbidden.\n\n  ""BLINK""?

B, U, O, Y, S -> O and S forbidden.\n\n  ""BUFFY""? B, U, F, F, Y -> F and Y are allowed. But we have two F\'s? And the pattern: \n      Position 1: B, 2: U, 3: I (must be I) -> so we cannot have B,U,F,F,Y because the third letter must be I. So we need to have I at position 3.\n\n  Therefore, the word must be of the form: [letter1][letter2]I[letter4][letter5]\n\n  So for ""BUFFY"", it doesn\'t have I at position 3.\n\n  How about ""BUDDY""? B, U, D, D, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.\n\n  So we must have a word with I in the middle.\n\n  Another candidate: ""BLUFF""? B, L, U, F, F -> no I.\n\n  We must have I at position 3.\n\n  So let\'s list words that have I as the third letter and use only the available letters.\n\n  We have:\n    BUILD: B, U, I, L, D\n    GUILD: G, U, I, L, D\n    FLUID: F, L, U, I, D -> wait, in FLUID, the third letter is U? Let\'s check: F-L-U-I-D -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:U, 4:I, 5:D -> so I is at position 4, not 3. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n  Correction: We need the third letter to be I. So in FLUID, the third letter is U, not I. So invalid.\n\n  How about ""BLISS""? But S is forbidden and also I is at position 3? B-L-I-S-S -> yes, I at 3. But S is forbidden (from moist: S absent). So invalid.\n\n  ""FLING""? F, L, I, N, G -> N is forbidden.\n\n  ""FLINT""? F, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.\n\n  ""GLINT""? G, L, I, N, T -> N and T forbidden.\n\n  ""BLIMP""? M forbidden.\n\n  ""BLINK""? N forbidden.\n\n  ""BLITZ""? B, L, I, T, Z -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""BLIND""? N forbidden.\n\n  ""BLIPS""? S forbidden.\n\n  ""BLIVE""? Not a word? And E forbidden.\n\n  ""BLUER""? E and R forbidden.\n\n  ""BLUES""? E and S forbidden.\n\n  ""BLUID""? This is a variant of BLOOD? Not standard. But let\'s see: B, L, U, I, D -> but then the third letter is U, not I. So no.\n\n  We need the third letter to be I. So the word must be: [consonant?][vowel?]I[consonant][consonant] or similar.\n\n  Another idea: ""PIQUE""? P, I, Q, U, E -> but I is at position 2, not 3. And E forbidden.\n\n  ""ADIEU""? A and E forbidden.\n\n  ""OILED""? O and E forbidden.\n\n  ""MINCE""? M, I, N, C, E -> all of M, N, C, E are forbidden.\n\n  We are having trouble. Let me think of words with I in the third position.\n\n  Common words: \n    CHAIR -> C and H: C forbidden.\n    TRAIN -> T, R, A, I, N -> T, R, A, N forbidden.\n    PLAIN -> P, L, A, I, N -> A and N forbidden.\n    BLAME -> B, L, A, M, E -> A, M, E forbidden.\n\n  How about ""QUILL""? Q, U, I, L, L -> but we have two L\'s. And the pattern: Q-U-I-L-L -> third letter is I. \n      Letters: Q, U, I, L. \n      Check forbidden: Q: allowed? (not in forbidden list), U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed. \n      But we have two L\'s? That\'s acceptable if the word has double letters? But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates. However, we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates.\n\n  But note: in the feedback, we only get per letter, and if a letter is duplicated and one is in the word, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we haven\'t seen L yet.\n\n  So ""QUILL"" is a candidate.\n\n  Similarly, ""SQUID""? S is forbidden.\n\n  ""GUIDE""? G, U, I, D, E -> E forbidden.\n\n  ""QUIET""? Q, U, I, E, T -> E and T forbidden.\n\n  ""QUIRK""? Q, U, I, R, K -> R forbidden.\n\n  ""QUIPU""? Q, U, I, P, U -> two U\'s? And U is allowed. But is it a word? It\'s a device used by the Incas. Might be accepted.\n\n  But let\'s stick to more common words.\n\n  ""BUILD"" and ""GUILD"" are common. And ""QUILL"" is also common.\n\n  We also have ""BUILT"", but T is forbidden.\n\n  Another: ""GUILT"" -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""FLUFF""? No I.\n\n  ""JUICE"" -> C and E forbidden.\n\n  ""JUICY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n  ""BLUFF"" -> no I.\n\n  ""PLUMB"" -> M forbidden.\n\n  So our candidates are: BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.\n\n  We can also consider ""BULKY""? B, U, L, K, Y -> but then I is not at position 3. We need I at position 3.\n\n  How about ""BIDDY""? B, I, D, D, Y -> I at position 2, not 3.\n\n  ""DIZZY""? D, I, Z, Z, Y -> I at position 2.\n\n  We must have I at position 3.\n\n  Another candidate: ""KILIM""? K, I, L, I, M -> M forbidden and also I is at position 2 and 4? The pattern: K-I-L-I-M -> third letter is L, not I. So no.\n\n  ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> O and T forbidden.\n\n  ""PILAF""? P, I, L, A, F -> A forbidden.\n\n  ""PILED""? P, I, L, E, D -> E forbidden.\n\n  ""WIELD""? W, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.\n\n  ""FIELD""? F, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.\n\n  ""YIELD""? Y, I, E, L, D -> E forbidden.\n\n  ""HILLY""? H, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2? H-I-L-L-Y -> third letter is L.\n\n  So we are back to BUILD, GUILD, QUILL.\n\n  Let me check the dictionary: \n    BUILD: valid\n    GUILD: valid\n    QUILL: valid\n\n  We can choose one. Since we want to test more common consonants, let\'s pick BUILD because it has B and D, which are common.\n\n  But note: we have to consider that we are on the third guess and we have limited tries. We might want to avoid repeating letters to maximize information.\n\n  BUILD has no repeated letters. Similarly, GUILD has no repeated letters. QUILL has two L\'s, so it tests fewer distinct letters.\n\n  So between BUILD and GUILD, which one? They share U, I, L, D. The only difference is the first letter: B vs G.\n\n  We don\'t have information about either. We might choose one arbitrarily.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that has letters we haven\'t tested at all. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, S, T.\n\n  We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  In BUILD, we test B, U, I, L, D. We already know I is in the word, so we are testing B, U, L, D.\n\n  In GUILD, we test G, U, I, L, D -> testing G, U, L, D.\n\n  We might also consider a word that doesn\'t have U, because U is less common? But we have to use the available letters.\n\n  Another candidate: ""PHYLA""? P, H, Y, L, A -> A forbidden.\n\n  ""LYMPH""? M forbidden.\n\n  ""WIGHT""? W, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""FIGHT""? F, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""LIGHT""? L, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""NIGHT""? N and T forbidden.\n\n  ""RIGHT""? R and T forbidden.\n\n  ""BIGHT""? B, I, G, H, T -> T forbidden.\n\n  ""DIGHT""? Not common.\n\n  ""PILCH""? Not common.\n\n  We are limited.\n\n  Let\'s try to find a word that has I in the third position and uses H, which is common.\n\n  ""WHICH""? W, H, I, C, H -> C forbidden.\n\n  ""THICK""? T, H, I, C, K -> T and C forbidden.\n\n  ""SHINY""? S forbidden.\n\n  ""CHINA""? C and A forbidden.\n\n  So H is hard to test.\n\n  Another idea: ""JUICE"" is invalid.\n\n  ""QUICK"" invalid.\n\n  ""BLINK"" invalid.\n\n  So I think BUILD or GUILD are our best bets.\n\n  Let me choose BUILD because B is more common than G? Actually, in English, G is also common.\n\n  But to decide, note that we have not tested B, D, G, etc. We can choose BUILD and then if it\'s wrong, we still have G to test.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes both B and G? But we need I at position 3.\n\n  How about ""BIGLY""? B, I, G, L, Y -> but then I is at position 2, not 3. We need I at position 3.\n\n  ""BOGIE""? B, O, G, I, E -> O and E forbidden.\n\n  ""BAGGY""? A and G: A forbidden.\n\n  So I think we go with BUILD.\n\n  But wait, we have another candidate: ""QUIPU"" we discarded because it\'s less common, but let\'s check: Q, U, I, P, U -> third letter is I? Q-U-I-P-U -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:P, 5:U. So yes, I at position 3. And letters: Q, U, I, P. We have two U\'s? But that\'s acceptable. However, it\'s not a very common word.\n\n  We should stick to common words.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""BUILD"".\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. BUILD: B, U, I, L, D. None of these are in the forbidden set.\n\n  So let\'s guess ""BUILD"".\n\n  However, we must be cautious: if the word is ""GUILD"", then we are close, but we are testing B instead of G.\n\n  But that\'s okay because we get information.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t use U? Because U is less common. But we don\'t have many options.\n\n  Another candidate: ""FLYBY""? F, L, Y, B, Y -> no I.\n\n  ""DIVVY"" -> no I at position 3.\n\n  ""BILLY""? B, I, L, L, Y -> I at position 2.\n\n  ""HILLY"" -> I at position 2.\n\n  ""WILLY"" -> I at position 2.\n\n  ""FILLY"" -> I at position 2.\n\n  ""PILLY"" -> I at position 2.\n\n  We need I at position 3.\n\n  ""AXIOM"" -> A and O forbidden.\n\n  ""EXIST"" -> E and S and T forbidden.\n\n  ""IONIC"" -> I at position 1? I-O-N-I-C -> I at 1 and 4. But N and C forbidden.\n\n  So I think BUILD is a reasonable guess.\n\n  Let\'s go with ""BUILD"".\n\n<guess>build</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).\n- ""moist"" had only the letter ""I"" correct and in position 3 (M, O, S, T absent).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have ""I"" as the third letter.\n- Exclude all previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words that fit these constraints (e.g., avoiding forbidden letters and placing ""I"" in position 3), ""BUILD"" is a valid guess. It uses new common letters (B, U, L, D) and tests plausible combinations while adhering to the feedback.\n\n<guess>build</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: build -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. ""moist"": M, O, S, T absent, but I is correct and in the right position (position 3).
3. ""build"": B absent, but U, I, L, D are correct. Specifically:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, the feedback says U(✓), I(✓), L(✓), D(✓). 
   - The checkmark (✓) means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

So for ""build"":
- Position 1: B -> absent (x)
- Position 2: U -> correct and in position (✓)
- Position 3: I -> correct and in position (✓) [we already knew this]
- Position 4: L -> correct and in position (✓)
- Position 5: D -> correct and in position (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ U I L D
- The first letter is not B (and also not any of the previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T).

We also know that the first letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet (from the absent letters) and must be a letter that is in the word.

But note: the feedback for ""build"" shows that U, I, L, D are in their correct positions (2,3,4,5). So the word is ? U I L D.

We only need to find the first letter. The first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the set of absent letters: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T (because B is now added to the absent list from this guess).
- And it must form a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters (consonants and vowels that haven't been tried): 
- We have tried: A, B, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, L, D. 
- I, U, L, D are in the word, but we are only missing the first letter.

The absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

So available letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a letter from this set such that ?UILD is a word.

Common words that end with ""UILD"": 
- The only common word I know is ""BUILD"", but B is absent. 
- Are there others?

Let me think: 
- GUILD: G U I L D -> that's a word! And G is available.

Other possibilities?
- QUILD? Not a word.
- HUILD? Not a word.
- JUILD? Not a word.
- KUILD? Not a word.
- PUILD? Not a word.
- VUILD? Not a word.
- WUILD? Not a word.
- XUILD? Not a word.
- YUILD? Not a word.
- ZUILD? Not a word.

So the only word that fits the pattern ?UILD with the available letters is ""GUILD"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""GUILD"".

But let's confirm:
- G is not in the absent list (we haven't tried G before, and it's available).
- The word ""GUILD"" means a medieval association of craftsmen or merchants, and it's a valid word.

So we can guess ""GUILD"".

But note: we have to make sure that G is allowed. The absent letters are A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T. G is not in that list.

Therefore, our next guess is ""GUILD"".

However, note that in the feedback for ""build"", we have U, I, L, D correct and in position. So the word is indeed ?UILD, and the only common word is ""GUILD"".

We are confident.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""moist""** → Only ""I"" is correct and in position 3 (M, O, S, T absent).  
- **Guess 3: ""build""** → ""U"", ""I"", ""L"", and ""D"" are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. ""B"" is absent.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[letter1] U I L D`.
- ""I"" is fixed at position 3, ""U"" at position 2, ""L"" at position 4, and ""D"" at position 5.
- The first letter must:
  - Be absent from the forbidden list: **A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T** (from all previous feedback).
  - Form a valid English word with ""UILD"".
- Available letters for position 1: **F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting `?UILD` is **""GUILD""** (e.g., a medieval association of craftsmen).
  - ""G"" is available (not forbidden).
  - Other combinations like QUILD, HUILD, or JUILD are not valid words.
- Since ""U"", ""I"", ""L"", and ""D"" are already confirmed in their correct positions, ""GUILD"" is the only logical solution.

### Final Guess:
<guess>guild</guess>",guild,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. ""crane"": all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. ""moist"": M, O, S, T absent, but I is correct and in the right position (position 3).
3. ""build"": B absent, but U, I, L, D are correct. Specifically:
   - U is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, the feedback says U(✓), I(✓), L(✓), D(✓). 
   - The checkmark (✓) means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.

So for ""build"":
- Position 1: B -> absent (x)
- Position 2: U -> correct and in position (✓)
- Position 3: I -> correct and in position (✓) [we already knew this]
- Position 4: L -> correct and in position (✓)
- Position 5: D -> correct and in position (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ U I L D
- The first letter is not B (and also not any of the previously absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T).

We also know that the first letter must be one that hasn't been tried yet (from the absent letters) and must be a letter that is in the word.

But note: the feedback for ""build"" shows that U, I, L, D are in their correct positions (2,3,4,5). So the word is ? U I L D.

We only need to find the first letter. The first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the set of absent letters: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T (because B is now added to the absent list from this guess).
- And it must form a valid 5-letter English word.

Available letters (consonants and vowels that haven't been tried): 
- We have tried: A, B, C, E, I, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, L, D. 
- I, U, L, D are in the word, but we are only missing the first letter.

The absent letters so far: A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T.

So available letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a letter from this set such that ?UILD is a word.

Common words that end with ""UILD"": 
- The only common word I know is ""BUILD"", but B is absent. 
- Are there others?

Let me think: 
- GUILD: G U I L D -> that's a word! And G is available.

Other possibilities?
- QUILD? Not a word.
- HUILD? Not a word.
- JUILD? Not a word.
- KUILD? Not a word.
- PUILD? Not a word.
- VUILD? Not a word.
- WUILD? Not a word.
- XUILD? Not a word.
- YUILD? Not a word.
- ZUILD? Not a word.

So the only word that fits the pattern ?UILD with the available letters is ""GUILD"".

Therefore, the secret word must be ""GUILD"".

But let's confirm:
- G is not in the absent list (we haven't tried G before, and it's available).
- The word ""GUILD"" means a medieval association of craftsmen or merchants, and it's a valid word.

So we can guess ""GUILD"".

But note: we have to make sure that G is allowed. The absent letters are A, B, C, E, M, N, O, R, S, T. G is not in that list.

Therefore, our next guess is ""GUILD"".

However, note that in the feedback for ""build"", we have U, I, L, D correct and in position. So the word is indeed ?UILD, and the only common word is ""GUILD"".

We are confident.
