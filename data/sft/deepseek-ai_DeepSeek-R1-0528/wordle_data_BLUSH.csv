We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information.
 Some popular starting words in word games are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc., because they contain common letters and distinct letters.

 I am going to choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels? Actually, it has one vowel 'A' and one sometimes vowel 'E'. But note: the word CRANE has the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 - It has common consonants: C, R, N.
 - All letters are distinct, which helps in getting more information.

 However, note that the feedback format requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid English word (meaning: a type of bird or a machine for lifting).

 Alternatively, other words like ""SLATE"" are also good. But since the example used in the problem had the letter 'B', I might avoid that for now.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We must output the guess in the specified format.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all).
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.

 Now, since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Let's think about common letters in 5-letter words: We've ruled out C, R, A, N, E. Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.

 Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible choices: 
   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:
   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.

 Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let's try a word with 5 new common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.

 The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let's think of one that has more vowels? We've only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.

 Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.

 The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that's five new letters.

 Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.

 But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven't tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.

 However, we have only 6 tries and we've used one, so let's go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.

 Some options:
 - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.
 - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.

 Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let's include U? Maybe later.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.

 Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.

 Let's prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.

 We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.

 But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.

 How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.

 Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.

 To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.

 So I choose: ""MOIST""

 Why MOIST?
 - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven't tried any of them.
 - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).

 Now, output the guess.
</think>
The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  

A strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:
- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  
- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  
- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.

Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.\n\n Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Possible choices: \n   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:\n   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.\n\n However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.\n\n Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.\n\n Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let\'s try a word with 5 new common letters.\n\n Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let\'s think of one that has more vowels? We\'ve only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.\n\n Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.\n\n The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that\'s five new letters.\n\n Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.\n\n But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven\'t tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries and we\'ve used one, so let\'s go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.\n\n Some options:\n - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.\n - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.\n\n Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let\'s include U? Maybe later.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.\n\n Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.\n\n Let\'s prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven\'t tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\n We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.\n\n But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.\n\n How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.\n\n Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.\n\n To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.\n\n So I choose: ""MOIST""\n\n Why MOIST?\n - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).\n\n Now, output the guess.The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  \n\nA strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:\n- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  \n- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  \n- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.
   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).

 Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 We also know the fourth letter is S.

 Now, we need to make a third guess that:
   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it's correct and in position).
   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 What letters are left? We have the English alphabet minus the absent ones.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Remaining vowels: U (and sometimes Y).

 But note: we have used the vowels A, E, I, O (all absent) so the only vowel left is U (and Y, which can be a vowel).

 So the word must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.

 We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.

 Let's list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):

 Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
 Position 2: same set
 Position 3: same set
 Position 4: S (fixed)
 Position 5: same set

 We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.

 Some examples:
   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S's? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don't know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S's. Also, we haven't tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).

   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven't tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.

   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S's, then if we guess a word with two S's and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it's present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn't have a second S, then we get x for the other S.

   However, to keep it simple for now, let's avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don't know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don't use S in the fifth, we won't know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it's not S? 

   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.

   So let's try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _

   Some words that come to mind:
     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.

     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.

     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S

     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.

     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?

     - Examples: 
         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let's index: 
             Position 1: B
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.

         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?

     - Some words: 
         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? 
             Position 1: F
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's third
             Position 4: S -> that's fourth -> good.
             But we have two S's. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don't know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.

         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S's. Also, we haven't tested F, U, Y.

         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that's a new position. We might get feedback on that.

     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that's 6 letters, not 5.

     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.

     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.

     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.

     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.

     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.

     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.

     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.

     - ""BUMPS"": same.

     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.

     - Let's try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

     - Words with pattern ???S?:

         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> 
             Position 1: D
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.

     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.

     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         Position 5: Y

         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).

     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> 
         Position 1: B
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.

     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? 

     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.

     - Examples: 
         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.
         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.
         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.
         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> 
             Position 1: L
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third
             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.
         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.

     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.

     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.

     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.

     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.

     - Let's try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn't repeat S? 

     - Words: 
         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? 
         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.

     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.

     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.

     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: G
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: F -> not S.

     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: P -> not S.

     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.

     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.

     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> 
         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don't know if there is another S. 
         However, in this word: 
             Position 1: S
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: L
             Position 4: K -> not S.

     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn't work.

     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it's not common.

     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.

     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.

     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.

     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.

     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> 
         Position 1: Z
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? 

     - Let's go with ""GUSSY"": 
         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.
         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.

     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.

     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.

     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.

     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? 

     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": 
         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.

     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.

     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.

     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.

     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options. Or ""PUSSY"", but let's avoid that.

     - Another word: ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""SUSUS"" — not a word.

     - ""WUSSY"" — might be considered offensive? 

     - Let's try ""HUSKS"": H U S K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""MUSKS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUSHY"" — P U S H Y -> S in third.

     - I think we have to use a word with S in the fourth and accept that there might be another S? 

     - How about ""BASKS"" — A absent.

     - ""BESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""BUSTS"" — B U S T S -> T is absent (from second guess: T is x).

     - ""CUSKS"" — C absent.

     - ""DESKS"" — E absent.

     - ""GESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""JUSTS"" — J U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""LUSTS"" — L U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""RESTS"" — R and E absent.

     - ""TRUST"" — T and R absent.

     - ""USAGE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""USHER"" — E and R absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — A absent.

     - ""USURP"" — U S U R P -> R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — U S U R Y -> R absent.

     - ""VESTA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""YESTY"" — E absent.

     - ""ZESTS"" — E absent.

     - I found: ""FUSSY"" and ""GUSSY"" are the only ones that seem to fit? 

     - Let me check ""GUSSY"": 
         It is a valid word. It means to make gaudy or showy.

     - Also, ""PUDUS"" is a word (a type of deer) but it's P U D U S -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""PULIS"" — P U L I S -> I absent.

     - ""PUNAS"" — U N A S -> N and A absent.

     - ""PURLS"" — P U R L S -> R absent.

     - ""PUTTS"" — T absent.

     - ""PYXES"" — E absent.

     - ""QUASS"" — Q U A S S -> A absent.

     - ""SUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""TUTUS"" — T absent.

     - ""UNSUN"" — U N S U N -> N absent.

     - ""URUBU"" — U R U B U -> R absent.

     - ""USNEA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""USQUE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURP"" — R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — R absent.

     - ""WUDUS"" — W U D U S -> 
         Position 1: W
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""YUKOS"" — O absent.

     - ""YULAN"" — A and N absent.

     - ""YUPON"" — O and N absent.

     - ""ZEBUS"" — E absent.

     - ""ZOBUS"" — O absent.

     - ""ZUPAN"" — A and N absent.

     - After this, I think ""GUSSY"" is acceptable.

     - But note: we are using two S's. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
         - Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓; if it has S but not in 3, we get -; if no other S, we get x.
         - We also test G, U, Y.

     - Alternatively, we can use ""FUSSY"" (which is more common) but it has F instead of G.

     - Let's choose ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y.

     - Why not ""HUSSY""? It might be sensitive, so let's avoid.

     - ""FUSSY"" is defined as excessively particular or hard to please.

     - So I'll go with ""FUSSY"".

     - But wait, in ""FUSSY"", the fourth letter is S? 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: S -> yes, the fourth is S.

     - So the guess is ""FUSSY"".

 However, note that we are using the letter S in position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is correct, so we'll get a ✓ for position 4. For position 3, we don't know.

 But we are also testing F, U, Y.

 If we get feedback that position 3 is ✓, then we know there are two S's and the third is also S. If it's -, then there is an S but not in third. If x, then no other S.

 This is acceptable.

 So let's guess ""FUSSY"".

 But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. F, U, S, S, Y: 
   - F: not in the absent list -> new.
   - U: not in the absent list -> new.
   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).
   - Y: new.

 So it's valid.

 Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S. But we are struggling to find one.

 Another word: ""DUSTS"" -> D U S T S -> T is absent.

 ""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> T is absent.

 ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y -> T absent.

 ""MUSTY"": M and T absent.

 ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> same as before.

 ""RUSHY"": R absent.

 ""TUSHY"": T absent.

 So I think ""FUSSY"" is a reasonable choice.

 Let's go with that.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Only **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T are absent.

1. **S is in position 4** of the secret word.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (cannot be used).  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The word must have **S in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words with **S fixed at position 4** and new, high-frequency letters (e.g., F, U, Y) to test.  
- After extensive search, **FUSSY** fits:  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: excessively particular).  
  - Uses available letters: F (new), U (new), S (known in position 4), Y (new).  
  - Tests for potential double-S (position 3) and new consonants/vowel (U, Y).  

<guess>fussy</guess>",fussy,"We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.
   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).

 Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 We also know the fourth letter is S.

 Now, we need to make a third guess that:
   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it's correct and in position).
   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 What letters are left? We have the English alphabet minus the absent ones.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Remaining vowels: U (and sometimes Y).

 But note: we have used the vowels A, E, I, O (all absent) so the only vowel left is U (and Y, which can be a vowel).

 So the word must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.

 We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.

 Let's list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):

 Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
 Position 2: same set
 Position 3: same set
 Position 4: S (fixed)
 Position 5: same set

 We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.

 Some examples:
   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S's? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don't know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S's. Also, we haven't tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).

   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven't tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.

   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S's, then if we guess a word with two S's and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it's present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn't have a second S, then we get x for the other S.

   However, to keep it simple for now, let's avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don't know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don't use S in the fifth, we won't know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it's not S? 

   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.

   So let's try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _

   Some words that come to mind:
     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.

     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.

     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S

     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.

     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?

     - Examples: 
         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let's index: 
             Position 1: B
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.

         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?

     - Some words: 
         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? 
             Position 1: F
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's third
             Position 4: S -> that's fourth -> good.
             But we have two S's. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don't know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.

         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S's. Also, we haven't tested F, U, Y.

         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that's a new position. We might get feedback on that.

     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that's 6 letters, not 5.

     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.

     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.

     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.

     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.

     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.

     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.

     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.

     - ""BUMPS"": same.

     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.

     - Let's try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

     - Words with pattern ???S?:

         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> 
             Position 1: D
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.

     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.

     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         Position 5: Y

         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).

     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> 
         Position 1: B
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.

     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? 

     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.

     - Examples: 
         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.
         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.
         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.
         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> 
             Position 1: L
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third
             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.
         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.

     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.

     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.

     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.

     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.

     - Let's try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn't repeat S? 

     - Words: 
         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? 
         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.

     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.

     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.

     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: G
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: F -> not S.

     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: P -> not S.

     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.

     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.

     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> 
         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don't know if there is another S. 
         However, in this word: 
             Position 1: S
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: L
             Position 4: K -> not S.

     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn't work.

     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it's not common.

     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.

     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.

     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.

     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.

     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> 
         Position 1: Z
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? 

     - Let's go with ""GUSSY"": 
         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.
         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.

     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.

     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.

     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.

     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? 

     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": 
         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.

     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.

     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.

     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.

     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options. Or ""PUSSY"", but let's avoid that.

     - Another word: ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""SUSUS"" — not a word.

     - ""WUSSY"" — might be considered offensive? 

     - Let's try ""HUSKS"": H U S K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""MUSKS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUSHY"" — P U S H Y -> S in third.

     - I think we have to use a word with S in the fourth and accept that there might be another S? 

     - How about ""BASKS"" — A absent.

     - ""BESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""BUSTS"" — B U S T S -> T is absent (from second guess: T is x).

     - ""CUSKS"" — C absent.

     - ""DESKS"" — E absent.

     - ""GESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""JUSTS"" — J U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""LUSTS"" — L U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""RESTS"" — R and E absent.

     - ""TRUST"" — T and R absent.

     - ""USAGE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""USHER"" — E and R absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — A absent.

     - ""USURP"" — U S U R P -> R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — U S U R Y -> R absent.

     - ""VESTA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""YESTY"" — E absent.

     - ""ZESTS"" — E absent.

     - I found: ""FUSSY"" and ""GUSSY"" are the only ones that seem to fit? 

     - Let me check ""GUSSY"": 
         It is a valid word. It means to make gaudy or showy.

     - Also, ""PUDUS"" is a word (a type of deer) but it's P U D U S -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""PULIS"" — P U L I S -> I absent.

     - ""PUNAS"" — U N A S -> N and A absent.

     - ""PURLS"" — P U R L S -> R absent.

     - ""PUTTS"" — T absent.

     - ""PYXES"" — E absent.

     - ""QUASS"" — Q U A S S -> A absent.

     - ""SUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""TUTUS"" — T absent.

     - ""UNSUN"" — U N S U N -> N absent.

     - ""URUBU"" — U R U B U -> R absent.

     - ""USNEA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""USQUE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURP"" — R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — R absent.

     - ""WUDUS"" — W U D U S -> 
         Position 1: W
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""YUKOS"" — O absent.

     - ""YULAN"" — A and N absent.

     - ""YUPON"" — O and N absent.

     - ""ZEBUS"" — E absent.

     - ""ZOBUS"" — O absent.

     - ""ZUPAN"" — A and N absent.

     - After this, I think ""GUSSY"" is acceptable.

     - But note: we are using two S's. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
         - Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓; if it has S but not in 3, we get -; if no other S, we get x.
         - We also test G, U, Y.

     - Alternatively, we can use ""FUSSY"" (which is more common) but it has F instead of G.

     - Let's choose ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y.

     - Why not ""HUSSY""? It might be sensitive, so let's avoid.

     - ""FUSSY"" is defined as excessively particular or hard to please.

     - So I'll go with ""FUSSY"".

     - But wait, in ""FUSSY"", the fourth letter is S? 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: S -> yes, the fourth is S.

     - So the guess is ""FUSSY"".

 However, note that we are using the letter S in position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is correct, so we'll get a ✓ for position 4. For position 3, we don't know.

 But we are also testing F, U, Y.

 If we get feedback that position 3 is ✓, then we know there are two S's and the third is also S. If it's -, then there is an S but not in third. If x, then no other S.

 This is acceptable.

 So let's guess ""FUSSY"".

 But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. F, U, S, S, Y: 
   - F: not in the absent list -> new.
   - U: not in the absent list -> new.
   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).
   - Y: new.

 So it's valid.

 Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S. But we are struggling to find one.

 Another word: ""DUSTS"" -> D U S T S -> T is absent.

 ""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> T is absent.

 ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y -> T absent.

 ""MUSTY"": M and T absent.

 ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> same as before.

 ""RUSHY"": R absent.

 ""TUSHY"": T absent.

 So I think ""FUSSY"" is a reasonable choice.

 Let's go with that.After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Only **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in position 4** of the secret word.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (cannot be used).  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The word must have **S in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words with **S fixed at position 4** and new, high-frequency letters (e.g., F, U, Y) to test.  
- After extensive search, **FUSSY** fits:  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: excessively particular).  
  - Uses available letters: F (new), U (new), S (known in position 4), Y (new).  
  - Tests for potential double-S (position 3) and new consonants/vowel (U, Y).",Guess 3: fussy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) S(-) S(✓) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BLUSH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information.
 Some popular starting words in word games are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc., because they contain common letters and distinct letters.

 I am going to choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels? Actually, it has one vowel 'A' and one sometimes vowel 'E'. But note: the word CRANE has the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 - It has common consonants: C, R, N.
 - All letters are distinct, which helps in getting more information.

 However, note that the feedback format requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid English word (meaning: a type of bird or a machine for lifting).

 Alternatively, other words like ""SLATE"" are also good. But since the example used in the problem had the letter 'B', I might avoid that for now.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We must output the guess in the specified format.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all).
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.

 Now, since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Let's think about common letters in 5-letter words: We've ruled out C, R, A, N, E. Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.

 Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible choices: 
   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:
   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.

 Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let's try a word with 5 new common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.

 The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let's think of one that has more vowels? We've only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.

 Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.

 The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that's five new letters.

 Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.

 But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven't tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.

 However, we have only 6 tries and we've used one, so let's go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.

 Some options:
 - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.
 - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.

 Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let's include U? Maybe later.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.

 Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.

 Let's prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.

 We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.

 But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.

 How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.

 Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.

 To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.

 So I choose: ""MOIST""

 Why MOIST?
 - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven't tried any of them.
 - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).

 Now, output the guess.The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  

A strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:
- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  
- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  
- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.
   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).

 Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 We also know the fourth letter is S.

 Now, we need to make a third guess that:
   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it's correct and in position).
   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 What letters are left? We have the English alphabet minus the absent ones.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Remaining vowels: U (and sometimes Y).

 But note: we have used the vowels A, E, I, O (all absent) so the only vowel left is U (and Y, which can be a vowel).

 So the word must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.

 We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.

 Let's list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):

 Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
 Position 2: same set
 Position 3: same set
 Position 4: S (fixed)
 Position 5: same set

 We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.

 Some examples:
   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S's? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don't know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S's. Also, we haven't tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).

   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven't tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.

   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S's, then if we guess a word with two S's and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it's present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn't have a second S, then we get x for the other S.

   However, to keep it simple for now, let's avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don't know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don't use S in the fifth, we won't know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it's not S? 

   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.

   So let's try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _

   Some words that come to mind:
     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.

     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.

     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S

     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.

     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?

     - Examples: 
         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let's index: 
             Position 1: B
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.

         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?

     - Some words: 
         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? 
             Position 1: F
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's third
             Position 4: S -> that's fourth -> good.
             But we have two S's. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don't know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.

         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S's. Also, we haven't tested F, U, Y.

         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that's a new position. We might get feedback on that.

     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that's 6 letters, not 5.

     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.

     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.

     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.

     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.

     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.

     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.

     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.

     - ""BUMPS"": same.

     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.

     - Let's try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

     - Words with pattern ???S?:

         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> 
             Position 1: D
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.

     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.

     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         Position 5: Y

         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).

     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> 
         Position 1: B
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.

     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? 

     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.

     - Examples: 
         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.
         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.
         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.
         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> 
             Position 1: L
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third
             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.
         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.

     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.

     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.

     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.

     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.

     - Let's try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn't repeat S? 

     - Words: 
         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? 
         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.

     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.

     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.

     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: G
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: F -> not S.

     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: P -> not S.

     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.

     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.

     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> 
         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don't know if there is another S. 
         However, in this word: 
             Position 1: S
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: L
             Position 4: K -> not S.

     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn't work.

     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it's not common.

     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.

     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.

     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.

     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.

     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> 
         Position 1: Z
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? 

     - Let's go with ""GUSSY"": 
         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.
         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.

     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.

     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.

     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.

     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? 

     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": 
         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.

     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.

     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.

     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.

     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options. Or ""PUSSY"", but let's avoid that.

     - Another word: ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""SUSUS"" — not a word.

     - ""WUSSY"" — might be considered offensive? 

     - Let's try ""HUSKS"": H U S K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""MUSKS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUSHY"" — P U S H Y -> S in third.

     - I think we have to use a word with S in the fourth and accept that there might be another S? 

     - How about ""BASKS"" — A absent.

     - ""BESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""BUSTS"" — B U S T S -> T is absent (from second guess: T is x).

     - ""CUSKS"" — C absent.

     - ""DESKS"" — E absent.

     - ""GESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""JUSTS"" — J U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""LUSTS"" — L U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""RESTS"" — R and E absent.

     - ""TRUST"" — T and R absent.

     - ""USAGE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""USHER"" — E and R absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — A absent.

     - ""USURP"" — U S U R P -> R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — U S U R Y -> R absent.

     - ""VESTA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""YESTY"" — E absent.

     - ""ZESTS"" — E absent.

     - I found: ""FUSSY"" and ""GUSSY"" are the only ones that seem to fit? 

     - Let me check ""GUSSY"": 
         It is a valid word. It means to make gaudy or showy.

     - Also, ""PUDUS"" is a word (a type of deer) but it's P U D U S -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""PULIS"" — P U L I S -> I absent.

     - ""PUNAS"" — U N A S -> N and A absent.

     - ""PURLS"" — P U R L S -> R absent.

     - ""PUTTS"" — T absent.

     - ""PYXES"" — E absent.

     - ""QUASS"" — Q U A S S -> A absent.

     - ""SUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""TUTUS"" — T absent.

     - ""UNSUN"" — U N S U N -> N absent.

     - ""URUBU"" — U R U B U -> R absent.

     - ""USNEA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""USQUE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURP"" — R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — R absent.

     - ""WUDUS"" — W U D U S -> 
         Position 1: W
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""YUKOS"" — O absent.

     - ""YULAN"" — A and N absent.

     - ""YUPON"" — O and N absent.

     - ""ZEBUS"" — E absent.

     - ""ZOBUS"" — O absent.

     - ""ZUPAN"" — A and N absent.

     - After this, I think ""GUSSY"" is acceptable.

     - But note: we are using two S's. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
         - Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓; if it has S but not in 3, we get -; if no other S, we get x.
         - We also test G, U, Y.

     - Alternatively, we can use ""FUSSY"" (which is more common) but it has F instead of G.

     - Let's choose ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y.

     - Why not ""HUSSY""? It might be sensitive, so let's avoid.

     - ""FUSSY"" is defined as excessively particular or hard to please.

     - So I'll go with ""FUSSY"".

     - But wait, in ""FUSSY"", the fourth letter is S? 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: S -> yes, the fourth is S.

     - So the guess is ""FUSSY"".

 However, note that we are using the letter S in position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is correct, so we'll get a ✓ for position 4. For position 3, we don't know.

 But we are also testing F, U, Y.

 If we get feedback that position 3 is ✓, then we know there are two S's and the third is also S. If it's -, then there is an S but not in third. If x, then no other S.

 This is acceptable.

 So let's guess ""FUSSY"".

 But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. F, U, S, S, Y: 
   - F: not in the absent list -> new.
   - U: not in the absent list -> new.
   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).
   - Y: new.

 So it's valid.

 Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S. But we are struggling to find one.

 Another word: ""DUSTS"" -> D U S T S -> T is absent.

 ""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> T is absent.

 ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y -> T absent.

 ""MUSTY"": M and T absent.

 ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> same as before.

 ""RUSHY"": R absent.

 ""TUSHY"": T absent.

 So I think ""FUSSY"" is a reasonable choice.

 Let's go with that.After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Only **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in position 4** of the secret word.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (cannot be used).  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The word must have **S in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words with **S fixed at position 4** and new, high-frequency letters (e.g., F, U, Y) to test.  
- After extensive search, **FUSSY** fits:  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: excessively particular).  
  - Uses available letters: F (new), U (new), S (known in position 4), Y (new).  
  - Tests for potential double-S (position 3) and new consonants/vowel (U, Y).

Since it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any prior information.\n A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information.\n Some popular starting words in word games are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc., because they contain common letters and distinct letters.\n\n I am going to choose ""CRANE"" because:\n - It has three common vowels? Actually, it has one vowel \'A\' and one sometimes vowel \'E\'. But note: the word CRANE has the letters C, R, A, N, E.\n - It has common consonants: C, R, N.\n - All letters are distinct, which helps in getting more information.\n\n However, note that the feedback format requires a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid English word (meaning: a type of bird or a machine for lifting).\n\n Alternatively, other words like ""SLATE"" are also good. But since the example used in the problem had the letter \'B\', I might avoid that for now.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\n Important: We must output the guess in the specified format.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all).\n Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.\n\n Now, since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.\n\n Let\'s think about common letters in 5-letter words: We\'ve ruled out C, R, A, N, E. Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.\n\n Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Possible choices: \n   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:\n   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.\n\n However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.\n\n Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.\n\n Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let\'s try a word with 5 new common letters.\n\n Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let\'s think of one that has more vowels? We\'ve only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.\n\n Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.\n\n The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that\'s five new letters.\n\n Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.\n\n But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven\'t tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries and we\'ve used one, so let\'s go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.\n\n Some options:\n - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.\n - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.\n\n Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let\'s include U? Maybe later.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.\n\n Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.\n\n Let\'s prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven\'t tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\n We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.\n\n But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.\n\n How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.\n\n Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.\n\n To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.\n\n So I choose: ""MOIST""\n\n Why MOIST?\n - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).\n\n Now, output the guess.The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  \n\nA strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:\n- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  \n- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  \n- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)\n This means:\n   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").\n   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.\n\n So now we know:\n   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.\n   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).\n\n Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\n We also know the fourth letter is S.\n\n Now, we need to make a third guess that:\n   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it\'s correct and in position).\n   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\n What letters are left? We have the English alphabet minus the absent ones.\n\n Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n Remaining vowels: U (and sometimes Y).\n\n But note: we have used the vowels A, E, I, O (all absent) so the only vowel left is U (and Y, which can be a vowel).\n\n So the word must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.\n\n We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.\n\n Let\'s list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):\n\n Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)\n Position 2: same set\n Position 3: same set\n Position 4: S (fixed)\n Position 5: same set\n\n We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.\n\n Some examples:\n   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S\'s? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don\'t know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn\'t indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S\'s. Also, we haven\'t tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).\n\n   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven\'t tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.\n\n   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S\'s, then if we guess a word with two S\'s and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it\'s present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn\'t have a second S, then we get x for the other S.\n\n   However, to keep it simple for now, let\'s avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don\'t know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don\'t use S in the fifth, we won\'t know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it\'s not S? \n\n   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.\n\n   So let\'s try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.\n\n   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _\n\n   Some words that come to mind:\n     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.\n\n     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.\n\n     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S\n\n     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.\n\n     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?\n\n     - Examples: \n         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let\'s index: \n             Position 1: B\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> that\'s the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.\n\n         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]\n\n     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?\n\n     - Some words: \n         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? \n             Position 1: F\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> that\'s third\n             Position 4: S -> that\'s fourth -> good.\n             But we have two S\'s. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don\'t know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.\n\n         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S\'s. Also, we haven\'t tested F, U, Y.\n\n         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that\'s a new position. We might get feedback on that.\n\n     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that\'s 6 letters, not 5.\n\n     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.\n\n     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> \n         Position 1: H\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> that\'s the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.\n\n     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.\n\n     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.\n\n     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.\n\n     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.\n\n     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.\n\n     - ""BUMPS"": same.\n\n     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.\n\n     - Let\'s try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n     - Words with pattern ???S?:\n\n         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> \n             Position 1: D\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.\n\n         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.\n\n     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.\n\n     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third\n         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.\n         Position 5: Y\n\n         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).\n\n     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> \n         Position 1: B\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.\n\n     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.\n\n     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? \n\n     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.\n\n     - Examples: \n         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.\n         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.\n         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.\n         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> \n             Position 1: L\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> third\n             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.\n         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.\n\n     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> \n         Position 1: P\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third\n         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.\n         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.\n\n     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.\n\n     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.\n\n     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.\n\n     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.\n\n     - Let\'s try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn\'t repeat S? \n\n     - Words: \n         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? \n         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.\n\n     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> \n         Position 1: F\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: G\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: F -> not S.\n\n     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: P -> not S.\n\n     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> \n         Position 1: H\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: K -> not S.\n\n     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.\n\n     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.\n\n     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.\n\n     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> \n         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don\'t know if there is another S. \n         However, in this word: \n             Position 1: S\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: L\n             Position 4: K -> not S.\n\n     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.\n\n     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it\'s not common.\n\n     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.\n\n     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.\n\n     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.\n\n     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> \n         Position 1: Z\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? \n\n     - Let\'s go with ""GUSSY"": \n         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we\'ll get:\n            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.\n         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.\n\n     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.\n\n     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.\n\n     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.\n\n     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.\n\n     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? \n\n     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": \n         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.\n\n     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options.

F, U, S, S, Y: \n   - F: not in the absent list -> new.\n   - U: not in the absent list -> new.\n   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).\n   - Y: new.\n\n So it\'s valid.\n\n Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S.

We have feedback from the third guess: ""fussy"" -> F(x), U(-), S(-), S(✓), Y(x)

 Interpretation:
   - F(x): F is not in the word at all.
   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S(-): The first S (in position 3) is in the word but not in position 3. But note: we already know S is in position 4 (from guess 2). So this means there is another S in the word? Actually, the feedback for the S in position 3 is that it is present but not in that position. Since we have two S's in the guess, and one of them (position 4) is correct, the other S (position 3) is present but in a different position? But wait, the feedback says S(-) for position 3 and S(✓) for position 4.

   However, note that the secret word might have only one S? But if it has only one S, then the S in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the only S is already correctly placed in position 4? But the feedback for position 3 is S(-), which means it is present but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S's: one in position 4 and at least one more elsewhere.

   But the feedback for the first S (position 3) is a dash (-), meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. And the second S (position 4) is a check (✓), meaning it is correct and in position.

   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has at least two S's: one fixed in position 4, and at least one more in a position that is not 3 (and not 2, because we have U in position 2 and it's not S, and not 1 or 5 because we don't have S there in this guess? Actually, we only have S in positions 3 and 4 in this guess).

   But note: the dash for S in position 3 means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3, 4 (but position 4 is already taken by the correct one). Since we have two S's in the guess, and one is correctly placed at 4, the other S (at 3) is not in the word? Or is it that the secret word has two S's, one at position 4 and one at another position, but not at 3? The dash for position 3 indicates that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3. Since we know there is one at 4, that satisfies? But actually, the feedback for the S at position 3 is that it is present (so there is at least one S that is not at position 4? Or does the dash for position 3 refer to the same S that is at position 4? 

   Let me clarify the rules: 
     - The feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, we get:
         ✓: correct letter in correct position.
         -: the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
         x: the letter is not in the word.

   For ""fussy"":
     - Position 1: F -> x (not in word)
     - Position 2: U -> - (in word, but not in position 2)
     - Position 3: S -> - (in word, but not in position 3)  [This means there is an S in the word that is not at position 3. But note: we also have an S at position 4 that is correct. So the S at position 3 is being considered as a separate occurrence?]

   How does the game handle duplicate letters?
     - Typically, if the secret word has two S's, and you guess two S's, then:
         - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
         - The other S, if it is in a position where the secret has S, then it gets - (if that position is not the same) or ✓ (if same). But if the secret has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked x.

   In this case, we have:
     - Secret must have at least two S's because:
         - The S at position 4 is correct (so one S at position 4).
         - The S at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position. That means there is another S in the secret word (at least one more) that is not at position 3.

   Therefore, the secret word has at least two S's.

   Also, U is present but not in position 2.

   And F and Y are absent.

   So update the absent letters: 
     From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
     From guess 2: M, O, I, T
     From guess 3: F, Y

   So absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.

   Present letters: 
     S (at least two, one fixed at position 4), and U (somewhere, not position 2).

   Also, from the feedback, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2.

   Now, the available letters are: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. And we have U and S (which we already know).

   We need to form a word that:
     - Has S in position 4.
     - Has at least two S's (so one more S in a position that is not 4 and not 3? But we don't know the position of the other S yet).
     - Has U, but not in position 2.
     - Uses only the available letters and the known present letters.

   The word must have the pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
   And it must contain at least one more S and one U.

   Let's think of possible positions for the other S and U.

   The other S can be in position 1, 2, or 5? (since position 3 we already tried and it was not there, and position 4 is fixed).

   Also, U is in the word but not in position 2, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

   We have to avoid the absent letters.

   Let's try to list possible words.

   Pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

   Constraints:
     - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S? but we are going to put S in one of these positions? Actually, we need at least one more S, so one of these positions must be S? Or could there be more? But we know at least two S's total).

   But note: we are allowed to use S in other positions? Yes, because we know it's present multiple times.

   So the letters for positions 1,2,3,5 can be from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S.

   However, we must include at least one more S (besides position 4) and one U.

   Let's consider:

   Option 1: Put the second S in position 1.
      Then the word: S _ _ S _
      And we need a U in one of the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not 2? Actually, U can be in 2? Wait, the feedback for U in guess 3 was that it is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent U from being in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, no: the dash for U in position 2 means that U is in the word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in position 2.

      Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if we put S in position 1, then U cannot be in 1. So U must be in 3 or 5.

      So pattern: S [not U and not S?] [possibly U] S [possibly U]

      But we have to fill position 2 and 3 and 5 with available letters, and one of 3 or 5 must be U? Or we could have U in position 1? But position 1 is S, so not.

      So we need U in position 3 or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""SUSUS"" -> but we have U in position 2? Not allowed because U cannot be in position 2. And also, we have to avoid absent letters. ""SUSUS"" has U in position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is U -> not allowed.

      How about ""S"" in position 1, then position 2 must not be U and not be an absent letter. Then position 3 can be U, and position 5 can be something.

        Example: ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> is that a word? Not really.

      Or ""S H U S P"" -> ""SHUSP"" -> not a word.

   Option 2: Put the second S in position 5.
      Then the word: _ _ _ S S
      And we need U in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is S, so U must be in 1 or 3.

      Example: 
        - ""U B S S S"" -> but we need two S's: we have three? The word would be ""UBSSS"" -> not a valid word? And also, we have to fill with available letters.

      More realistically: 
        - ""B U S S S"" -> ""BUSSS"" -> not a word.
        - ""D U S S S"" -> same.

      How about: ""L U S S S"" -> ""LUSSS"" -> no.

      Or with U in position 1: ""U B L S S"" -> ""UBLSS"" -> not a word.

      Or ""U P S S S"" -> ""UPSSS"" -> no.

   Option 3: Put the second S in position 3? But wait, in guess 3 we had S in position 3 and it was marked as dash, meaning that the secret word does not have an S in position 3. So we cannot put S in position 3? Because the feedback told us that position 3 is not S. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But position 2: we are about to try? 

   However, note: the feedback for position 3 in guess 3 was that S is present but not in position 3. That doesn't prevent us from putting S in position 3 again? Actually, we know it's not there, so we should avoid putting S in position 3. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

   But we just tried position 1 and 5 and didn't find common words.

   Option 4: Put the second S in position 2? 
      Then the word: _ S _ S _
      And U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because position 2 is S now, and U cannot be in 2 anyway).

      So U can be in 1, 3, or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""U S B S K"" -> ""USB SK"" -> not a word.
        - ""B S U S K"" -> ""BSU SK"" -> not a word.

      How about ""ASSUME"" -> but A and E absent.

      ""ISSUE"" -> I and E absent.

      ""ESSUX"" -> E absent.

      ""ASSURE"" -> A, R, E absent.

      ""ISSUED"" -> I, E, D? D is available, but the word is 6 letters.

      We need 5-letter words.

      ""PSSST"" -> not a word.

      ""ESSAY"" -> E and A absent.

      ""ASSET"" -> A, E, T absent.

      ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, Y absent.

      ""GASSY"" -> G? But we have G available? But wait, ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""FUSSY"" we already tried.

      ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> but Y is absent, and we are putting S in position 2? In ""HUSSY"", the S's are in positions 3 and 4. We need S in position 2 and 4.

      How about ""BUSSES"" -> 6 letters.

      ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""LASSY"": L A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""MASSY"": M and Y absent.

      ""PASSY"": P A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""TASSY"": T and Y absent.

      ""WUSSY"": W U S S Y -> but Y is absent.

      ""JUSSI"" -> not a word.

      ""SISSY"": S I S S Y -> I and Y absent.

      ""SUSES"": S U S E S -> E absent.

      ""SUSUS"" -> not a word.

      ""SUSPS"" -> not a word.

   This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the secret word might have more than two S's? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we might have the U in position 1 or 5 and the second S in position 1 or 5.

   Let me try to list words that have S in position 4 and at least one more S, and U somewhere (not position 2), and avoid absent letters.

   We can use a word list? But we don't have one, so we have to think.

   Another idea: the word ""SUDDS"": 
        S U D D S -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: U -> but U cannot be in position 2? Because in guess 3, U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning U is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

   How about ""SUDDS"" has U in position 2 -> not allowed.

   ""SUSUD"" -> not a word.

   ""USURE"" -> E absent.

   ""USURP"" -> R absent.

   ""USUAL"" -> A absent.

   ""USUFS"" -> not a word.

   ""USULU"" -> not a word.

   ""USQUE"" -> E absent.

   ""USNEA"" -> E and A absent.

   ""USARA"" -> A absent.

   ""USAGE"" -> A and E absent.

   ""USHER"" -> E and R absent.

   ""USNIC"" -> C absent.

   ""USENT"" -> E and N and T absent.

   I'm struggling. Let's try a different approach: put U in position 1 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: U _ _ S S

   Then we need to fill position 2 and 3 with available letters (B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and possibly S? But we already have two S's (position 4 and 5), so we don't need more.

   Example: ""U B D S S"" -> ""UBDSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U G G S S"" -> ""UGGSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U P P S S"" -> ""UPPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U L L S S"" -> ""ULLSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S L S S"" -> ""USLSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 1 and S in position 2? But position 2 is not allowed for U? No, U is in position 1, which is allowed. But we are also putting S in position 2? That would be the second S? But we have S in position 4 and 5 and also 2? That's three S's. And the word would be ""USLSS"" -> not a word.

   How about ""U S _ S _"" but then we have S in position 2, which is not allowed for U? But U is in 1. However, we are trying to avoid S in position 2? We don't know if it's allowed or not. We only know that U is not in position 2, but S can be in position 2.

   But in this pattern, if we put S in position 2, then the word is ""U S ? S ?"", and we need to fill the third and fifth.

   Example: ""U S B S S"" -> ""USBSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S P S S"" -> ""USPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S W S S"" -> ""USWSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S G S S"" -> ""USGSS"" -> not a word.

   This is not working.

   What if we put the second S in position 1 and U in position 5?
      Pattern: S _ _ S U

   Then fill position 2 and 3 with available letters.

   Example: ""S B D S U"" -> ""SBDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H D S U"" -> ""SHDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K D S U"" -> ""SKDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P D S U"" -> ""SPDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S L D S U"" -> ""SLDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V D S U"" -> ""SVDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W D S U"" -> ""SWDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S G G S U"" -> ""SGGSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P L S U"" -> ""SPLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K L S U"" -> ""SKLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H L S U"" -> ""SHLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V L S U"" -> ""SVLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W L S U"" -> ""SWLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P P S U"" -> ""SPPSU"" -> not a word.

   I am considering that the secret word might have U in position 3 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: _ _ U S S

   Then position 1 and 2 are to be filled.

   Example: ""B L U S S"" -> ""BLUSS"" -> not a word.

   ""B U U S S"" -> ""BUUSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 2 is not allowed? We can have U in position 2? But the feedback said U is not in position 2, but it can be in other positions. However, this has U in position 2 and 3? But the feedback only said U is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about position 3. So U can be in position 3.

   But in ""BUUSS"", we have U in position 2 and 3. Position 2 is not allowed for U? The feedback from guess 3: U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning that there is a U in the word, but not in position 2. So if the secret word has U in position 2, that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the secret word does not have U in position 2. So we cannot have U in position 2 in our guess either? No, we can, but it would be marked as absent or dash? 

   But in our guess, if we put U in position 2, and the secret word has U but not in position 2, then we would get a dash for that U? Or if the secret word has only one U and it's in position 3, then the U in position 2 would be marked as dash? But that would be inconsistent with the secret word not having U in position 2. 

   Actually, the feedback for a letter in the guess is independent. If we guess U in position 2, and the secret word has U in position 3, then we would get a dash for position 2.

   But in this case, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2. So if we guess U in position 2, we will get a dash (because U is in the word but not in position 2). 

   However, we already know that, so it doesn't give us new information. We want to test new positions.

   So back to pattern _ _ U S S:

   We can try:
     ""B G U S S"" -> ""BGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""D G U S S"" -> ""DGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G G U S S"" -> ""GGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""H G U S S"" -> ""HGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""J G U S S"" -> ""JGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""K G U S S"" -> ""KGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""L G U S S"" -> ""LGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""P G U S S"" -> ""PGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""V G U S S"" -> ""VGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""W G U S S"" -> ""WGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""X G U S S"" -> ""XGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""Z G U S S"" -> ""ZGUSS"" -> not a word.

   Or with different letter in position 1:

     ""G B U S S"" -> ""GBUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G D U S S"" -> ""GDUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G H U S S"" -> ""GHUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""GHUSS"" might be ""ghus"" (a type of wild sheep)? But it's not a standard word. Typically, it's ""ghus"" is not a 5-letter word.

   How about "" issue"" but I and E absent.

   I am considering the word ""truss"" -> T and R absent.

   ""bless"" -> E absent.

   ""dress"" -> E and R absent.

   ""guess"" -> E absent.

   ""jess"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""kiss"" -> not 5.

   ""loss"" -> not 5.

   ""mess"" -> not 5.

   ""press"" -> P R E -> R and E absent.

   ""tress"" -> T, R, E absent.

   ""buss"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""cuss"" -> C absent.

   ""fuss"" -> F absent.

   ""muss"" -> M absent.

   ""puss"" -> ""puss"" is 4 letters.

   ""wuss"" -> ""wuss"" is 4 letters.

   ""luser"" -> E and R absent.

   I am considering that the second S might be in position 1, and U in position 3.

   Pattern: S _ U S _

   Example: ""S B U S K"" -> ""SBUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S G U S K"" -> ""SGUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S K"" -> ""SHUSK"" -> valid word! ""husk"" is a word, but ""SHUSK"" is not. ""HUSK"" is 4 letters.

   ""S K U S K"" -> ""SKUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S L U S K"" -> ""SLUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S P U S K"" -> ""SPUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S V U S K"" -> ""SVUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S W U S K"" -> ""SWUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S B U S H"" -> ""SBUSH"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S H"" -> ""SHUSH"" -> valid word! ""SHUSH""

   Let's check ""SHUSH"":
     - S in position 1, H in 2, U in 3, S in 4, H in 5.
     - We know the secret word has S in position 4 -> matches.
     - It has two S's: positions 1 and 4.
     - It has U in position 3 -> which is allowed (U not in position 2).
     - Letters: S, H, U, S, H.
     - Check absent letters: H is not in the absent list, so it's available.
     - The word ""shush"" is a valid English word (meaning: to urge to be quiet).

   Now, does it meet all?
     - Position 4 is S -> correct.
     - It has at least two S's: yes.
     - U is in the word, not in position 2: it's in position 3.
     - Avoids absent letters: S, H, U are not absent.

   But note: we have H in position 2 and 5. We don't know if H is in the word or not. We haven't tested H before.

   Also, the feedback from guess 3: we had F, U, S, S, Y. We know U is present, S is present, F and Y are absent. We don't have information on H.

   So ""SHUSH"" seems to be a valid guess.

   Let's see if there are other possibilities.

   Another word: ""SLUSH"" -> but L is available, and U in position 3. ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: L
        Position 3: U
        Position 4: S
        Position 5: H
        This also has two S's and U in position 3.

   ""SLUSH"" is a word (meaning: partially melted snow).

   So we have at least two candidates: ""SHUSH"" and ""SLUSH"".

   We need to choose one that maximizes information. We want to test new letters.

   In ""SHUSH"", we are using H twice. We haven't tested H before, so we are testing H.

   In ""SLUSH"", we are testing L and H.

   Since we have more letters to test, ""SLUSH"" tests two new letters (L and H) while ""SHUSH"" tests only H (but twice).

   So ""SLUSH"" might be better.

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters. Both are valid.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have H or not. We don't know.

   Given that we have limited guesses, let's go with ""SLUSH"".

   But wait, in ""SLUSH"", the second S is in position 1 and 4. We know position 4 is S, and position 1 is being tested. The feedback for position 1 will tell us if there is an S in position 1 or not.

   Similarly, we test L in position 2 and H in position 5.

   So I think ""SLUSH"" is a good guess.

   Let's output that.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  
2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T absent.  
3. **Guess 3: FUSSY** →  
   - **F(x)**: F absent.  
   - **U(-)**: U present but not in position 2.  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 3 (indicating at least one **additional S** besides position 4).  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - **Y(x)**: Y absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word has**:  
  - **S in position 4**.  
  - **At least two S's** (one fixed at position 4, another elsewhere).  
  - **U present**, but **not in position 2** (so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S for additional positions).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Constraints**:  
  - Must have **S in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  
  - Must include **at least one more S** (positions 1, 2, or 5) and **U** (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Prioritize** words that:  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L).  
  - Avoid redundant guesses (e.g., re-testing position 3 for S).  
- **Selected word: SLUSH**:  
  - **S** in position 1 (tests for additional S).  
  - **L** in position 2 (new consonant).  
  - **U** in position 3 (allowed, since U cannot be in position 2).  
  - **S** in position 4 (fixed).  
  - **H** in position 5 (new consonant).  
- **Why SLUSH?**  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: partially melted snow).  
  - Tests 3 new letters (L, H) and confirms S/U positions.  
  - Aligns with all constraints and feedback.  

<guess>slush</guess>",slush,"We have feedback from the third guess: ""fussy"" -> F(x), U(-), S(-), S(✓), Y(x)

 Interpretation:
   - F(x): F is not in the word at all.
   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S(-): The first S (in position 3) is in the word but not in position 3. But note: we already know S is in position 4 (from guess 2). So this means there is another S in the word? Actually, the feedback for the S in position 3 is that it is present but not in that position. Since we have two S's in the guess, and one of them (position 4) is correct, the other S (position 3) is present but in a different position? But wait, the feedback says S(-) for position 3 and S(✓) for position 4.

   However, note that the secret word might have only one S? But if it has only one S, then the S in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the only S is already correctly placed in position 4? But the feedback for position 3 is S(-), which means it is present but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S's: one in position 4 and at least one more elsewhere.

   But the feedback for the first S (position 3) is a dash (-), meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. And the second S (position 4) is a check (✓), meaning it is correct and in position.

   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has at least two S's: one fixed in position 4, and at least one more in a position that is not 3 (and not 2, because we have U in position 2 and it's not S, and not 1 or 5 because we don't have S there in this guess? Actually, we only have S in positions 3 and 4 in this guess).

   But note: the dash for S in position 3 means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3, 4 (but position 4 is already taken by the correct one). Since we have two S's in the guess, and one is correctly placed at 4, the other S (at 3) is not in the word? Or is it that the secret word has two S's, one at position 4 and one at another position, but not at 3? The dash for position 3 indicates that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3. Since we know there is one at 4, that satisfies? But actually, the feedback for the S at position 3 is that it is present (so there is at least one S that is not at position 4? Or does the dash for position 3 refer to the same S that is at position 4? 

   Let me clarify the rules: 
     - The feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, we get:
         ✓: correct letter in correct position.
         -: the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
         x: the letter is not in the word.

   For ""fussy"":
     - Position 1: F -> x (not in word)
     - Position 2: U -> - (in word, but not in position 2)
     - Position 3: S -> - (in word, but not in position 3)  [This means there is an S in the word that is not at position 3. But note: we also have an S at position 4 that is correct. So the S at position 3 is being considered as a separate occurrence?]

   How does the game handle duplicate letters?
     - Typically, if the secret word has two S's, and you guess two S's, then:
         - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
         - The other S, if it is in a position where the secret has S, then it gets - (if that position is not the same) or ✓ (if same). But if the secret has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked x.

   In this case, we have:
     - Secret must have at least two S's because:
         - The S at position 4 is correct (so one S at position 4).
         - The S at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position. That means there is another S in the secret word (at least one more) that is not at position 3.

   Therefore, the secret word has at least two S's.

   Also, U is present but not in position 2.

   And F and Y are absent.

   So update the absent letters: 
     From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
     From guess 2: M, O, I, T
     From guess 3: F, Y

   So absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.

   Present letters: 
     S (at least two, one fixed at position 4), and U (somewhere, not position 2).

   Also, from the feedback, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2.

   Now, the available letters are: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. And we have U and S (which we already know).

   We need to form a word that:
     - Has S in position 4.
     - Has at least two S's (so one more S in a position that is not 4 and not 3? But we don't know the position of the other S yet).
     - Has U, but not in position 2.
     - Uses only the available letters and the known present letters.

   The word must have the pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
   And it must contain at least one more S and one U.

   Let's think of possible positions for the other S and U.

   The other S can be in position 1, 2, or 5? (since position 3 we already tried and it was not there, and position 4 is fixed).

   Also, U is in the word but not in position 2, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

   We have to avoid the absent letters.

   Let's try to list possible words.

   Pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

   Constraints:
     - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S? but we are going to put S in one of these positions? Actually, we need at least one more S, so one of these positions must be S? Or could there be more? But we know at least two S's total).

   But note: we are allowed to use S in other positions? Yes, because we know it's present multiple times.

   So the letters for positions 1,2,3,5 can be from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S.

   However, we must include at least one more S (besides position 4) and one U.

   Let's consider:

   Option 1: Put the second S in position 1.
      Then the word: S _ _ S _
      And we need a U in one of the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not 2? Actually, U can be in 2? Wait, the feedback for U in guess 3 was that it is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent U from being in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, no: the dash for U in position 2 means that U is in the word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in position 2.

      Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if we put S in position 1, then U cannot be in 1. So U must be in 3 or 5.

      So pattern: S [not U and not S?] [possibly U] S [possibly U]

      But we have to fill position 2 and 3 and 5 with available letters, and one of 3 or 5 must be U? Or we could have U in position 1? But position 1 is S, so not.

      So we need U in position 3 or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""SUSUS"" -> but we have U in position 2? Not allowed because U cannot be in position 2. And also, we have to avoid absent letters. ""SUSUS"" has U in position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is U -> not allowed.

      How about ""S"" in position 1, then position 2 must not be U and not be an absent letter. Then position 3 can be U, and position 5 can be something.

        Example: ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> is that a word? Not really.

      Or ""S H U S P"" -> ""SHUSP"" -> not a word.

   Option 2: Put the second S in position 5.
      Then the word: _ _ _ S S
      And we need U in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is S, so U must be in 1 or 3.

      Example: 
        - ""U B S S S"" -> but we need two S's: we have three? The word would be ""UBSSS"" -> not a valid word? And also, we have to fill with available letters.

      More realistically: 
        - ""B U S S S"" -> ""BUSSS"" -> not a word.
        - ""D U S S S"" -> same.

      How about: ""L U S S S"" -> ""LUSSS"" -> no.

      Or with U in position 1: ""U B L S S"" -> ""UBLSS"" -> not a word.

      Or ""U P S S S"" -> ""UPSSS"" -> no.

   Option 3: Put the second S in position 3? But wait, in guess 3 we had S in position 3 and it was marked as dash, meaning that the secret word does not have an S in position 3. So we cannot put S in position 3? Because the feedback told us that position 3 is not S. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But position 2: we are about to try? 

   However, note: the feedback for position 3 in guess 3 was that S is present but not in position 3. That doesn't prevent us from putting S in position 3 again? Actually, we know it's not there, so we should avoid putting S in position 3. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

   But we just tried position 1 and 5 and didn't find common words.

   Option 4: Put the second S in position 2? 
      Then the word: _ S _ S _
      And U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because position 2 is S now, and U cannot be in 2 anyway).

      So U can be in 1, 3, or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""U S B S K"" -> ""USB SK"" -> not a word.
        - ""B S U S K"" -> ""BSU SK"" -> not a word.

      How about ""ASSUME"" -> but A and E absent.

      ""ISSUE"" -> I and E absent.

      ""ESSUX"" -> E absent.

      ""ASSURE"" -> A, R, E absent.

      ""ISSUED"" -> I, E, D? D is available, but the word is 6 letters.

      We need 5-letter words.

      ""PSSST"" -> not a word.

      ""ESSAY"" -> E and A absent.

      ""ASSET"" -> A, E, T absent.

      ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, Y absent.

      ""GASSY"" -> G? But we have G available? But wait, ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""FUSSY"" we already tried.

      ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> but Y is absent, and we are putting S in position 2? In ""HUSSY"", the S's are in positions 3 and 4. We need S in position 2 and 4.

      How about ""BUSSES"" -> 6 letters.

      ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""LASSY"": L A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""MASSY"": M and Y absent.

      ""PASSY"": P A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""TASSY"": T and Y absent.

      ""WUSSY"": W U S S Y -> but Y is absent.

      ""JUSSI"" -> not a word.

      ""SISSY"": S I S S Y -> I and Y absent.

      ""SUSES"": S U S E S -> E absent.

      ""SUSUS"" -> not a word.

      ""SUSPS"" -> not a word.

   This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the secret word might have more than two S's? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we might have the U in position 1 or 5 and the second S in position 1 or 5.

   Let me try to list words that have S in position 4 and at least one more S, and U somewhere (not position 2), and avoid absent letters.

   We can use a word list? But we don't have one, so we have to think.

   Another idea: the word ""SUDDS"": 
        S U D D S -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: U -> but U cannot be in position 2? Because in guess 3, U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning U is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

   How about ""SUDDS"" has U in position 2 -> not allowed.

   ""SUSUD"" -> not a word.

   ""USURE"" -> E absent.

   ""USURP"" -> R absent.

   ""USUAL"" -> A absent.

   ""USUFS"" -> not a word.

   ""USULU"" -> not a word.

   ""USQUE"" -> E absent.

   ""USNEA"" -> E and A absent.

   ""USARA"" -> A absent.

   ""USAGE"" -> A and E absent.

   ""USHER"" -> E and R absent.

   ""USNIC"" -> C absent.

   ""USENT"" -> E and N and T absent.

   I'm struggling. Let's try a different approach: put U in position 1 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: U _ _ S S

   Then we need to fill position 2 and 3 with available letters (B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and possibly S? But we already have two S's (position 4 and 5), so we don't need more.

   Example: ""U B D S S"" -> ""UBDSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U G G S S"" -> ""UGGSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U P P S S"" -> ""UPPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U L L S S"" -> ""ULLSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S L S S"" -> ""USLSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 1 and S in position 2? But position 2 is not allowed for U? No, U is in position 1, which is allowed. But we are also putting S in position 2? That would be the second S? But we have S in position 4 and 5 and also 2? That's three S's. And the word would be ""USLSS"" -> not a word.

   How about ""U S _ S _"" but then we have S in position 2, which is not allowed for U? But U is in 1. However, we are trying to avoid S in position 2? We don't know if it's allowed or not. We only know that U is not in position 2, but S can be in position 2.

   But in this pattern, if we put S in position 2, then the word is ""U S ? S ?"", and we need to fill the third and fifth.

   Example: ""U S B S S"" -> ""USBSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S P S S"" -> ""USPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S W S S"" -> ""USWSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S G S S"" -> ""USGSS"" -> not a word.

   This is not working.

   What if we put the second S in position 1 and U in position 5?
      Pattern: S _ _ S U

   Then fill position 2 and 3 with available letters.

   Example: ""S B D S U"" -> ""SBDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H D S U"" -> ""SHDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K D S U"" -> ""SKDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P D S U"" -> ""SPDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S L D S U"" -> ""SLDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V D S U"" -> ""SVDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W D S U"" -> ""SWDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S G G S U"" -> ""SGGSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P L S U"" -> ""SPLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K L S U"" -> ""SKLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H L S U"" -> ""SHLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V L S U"" -> ""SVLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W L S U"" -> ""SWLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P P S U"" -> ""SPPSU"" -> not a word.

   I am considering that the secret word might have U in position 3 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: _ _ U S S

   Then position 1 and 2 are to be filled.

   Example: ""B L U S S"" -> ""BLUSS"" -> not a word.

   ""B U U S S"" -> ""BUUSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 2 is not allowed? We can have U in position 2? But the feedback said U is not in position 2, but it can be in other positions. However, this has U in position 2 and 3? But the feedback only said U is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about position 3. So U can be in position 3.

   But in ""BUUSS"", we have U in position 2 and 3. Position 2 is not allowed for U? The feedback from guess 3: U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning that there is a U in the word, but not in position 2. So if the secret word has U in position 2, that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the secret word does not have U in position 2. So we cannot have U in position 2 in our guess either? No, we can, but it would be marked as absent or dash? 

   But in our guess, if we put U in position 2, and the secret word has U but not in position 2, then we would get a dash for that U? Or if the secret word has only one U and it's in position 3, then the U in position 2 would be marked as dash? But that would be inconsistent with the secret word not having U in position 2. 

   Actually, the feedback for a letter in the guess is independent. If we guess U in position 2, and the secret word has U in position 3, then we would get a dash for position 2.

   But in this case, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2. So if we guess U in position 2, we will get a dash (because U is in the word but not in position 2). 

   However, we already know that, so it doesn't give us new information. We want to test new positions.

   So back to pattern _ _ U S S:

   We can try:
     ""B G U S S"" -> ""BGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""D G U S S"" -> ""DGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G G U S S"" -> ""GGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""H G U S S"" -> ""HGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""J G U S S"" -> ""JGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""K G U S S"" -> ""KGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""L G U S S"" -> ""LGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""P G U S S"" -> ""PGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""V G U S S"" -> ""VGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""W G U S S"" -> ""WGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""X G U S S"" -> ""XGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""Z G U S S"" -> ""ZGUSS"" -> not a word.

   Or with different letter in position 1:

     ""G B U S S"" -> ""GBUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G D U S S"" -> ""GDUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G H U S S"" -> ""GHUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""GHUSS"" might be ""ghus"" (a type of wild sheep)? But it's not a standard word. Typically, it's ""ghus"" is not a 5-letter word.

   How about "" issue"" but I and E absent.

   I am considering the word ""truss"" -> T and R absent.

   ""bless"" -> E absent.

   ""dress"" -> E and R absent.

   ""guess"" -> E absent.

   ""jess"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""kiss"" -> not 5.

   ""loss"" -> not 5.

   ""mess"" -> not 5.

   ""press"" -> P R E -> R and E absent.

   ""tress"" -> T, R, E absent.

   ""buss"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""cuss"" -> C absent.

   ""fuss"" -> F absent.

   ""muss"" -> M absent.

   ""puss"" -> ""puss"" is 4 letters.

   ""wuss"" -> ""wuss"" is 4 letters.

   ""luser"" -> E and R absent.

   I am considering that the second S might be in position 1, and U in position 3.

   Pattern: S _ U S _

   Example: ""S B U S K"" -> ""SBUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S G U S K"" -> ""SGUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S K"" -> ""SHUSK"" -> valid word! ""husk"" is a word, but ""SHUSK"" is not. ""HUSK"" is 4 letters.

   ""S K U S K"" -> ""SKUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S L U S K"" -> ""SLUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S P U S K"" -> ""SPUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S V U S K"" -> ""SVUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S W U S K"" -> ""SWUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S B U S H"" -> ""SBUSH"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S H"" -> ""SHUSH"" -> valid word! ""SHUSH""

   Let's check ""SHUSH"":
     - S in position 1, H in 2, U in 3, S in 4, H in 5.
     - We know the secret word has S in position 4 -> matches.
     - It has two S's: positions 1 and 4.
     - It has U in position 3 -> which is allowed (U not in position 2).
     - Letters: S, H, U, S, H.
     - Check absent letters: H is not in the absent list, so it's available.
     - The word ""shush"" is a valid English word (meaning: to urge to be quiet).

   Now, does it meet all?
     - Position 4 is S -> correct.
     - It has at least two S's: yes.
     - U is in the word, not in position 2: it's in position 3.
     - Avoids absent letters: S, H, U are not absent.

   But note: we have H in position 2 and 5. We don't know if H is in the word or not. We haven't tested H before.

   Also, the feedback from guess 3: we had F, U, S, S, Y. We know U is present, S is present, F and Y are absent. We don't have information on H.

   So ""SHUSH"" seems to be a valid guess.

   Let's see if there are other possibilities.

   Another word: ""SLUSH"" -> but L is available, and U in position 3. ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: L
        Position 3: U
        Position 4: S
        Position 5: H
        This also has two S's and U in position 3.

   ""SLUSH"" is a word (meaning: partially melted snow).

   So we have at least two candidates: ""SHUSH"" and ""SLUSH"".

   We need to choose one that maximizes information. We want to test new letters.

   In ""SHUSH"", we are using H twice. We haven't tested H before, so we are testing H.

   In ""SLUSH"", we are testing L and H.

   Since we have more letters to test, ""SLUSH"" tests two new letters (L and H) while ""SHUSH"" tests only H (but twice).

   So ""SLUSH"" might be better.

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters. Both are valid.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have H or not. We don't know.

   Given that we have limited guesses, let's go with ""SLUSH"".

   But wait, in ""SLUSH"", the second S is in position 1 and 4. We know position 4 is S, and position 1 is being tested. The feedback for position 1 will tell us if there is an S in position 1 or not.

   Similarly, we test L in position 2 and H in position 5.

   So I think ""SLUSH"" is a good guess.

   Let's output that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  
2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T absent.  
3. **Guess 3: FUSSY** →  
   - **F(x)**: F absent.  
   - **U(-)**: U present but not in position 2.  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 3 (indicating at least one **additional S** besides position 4).  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - **Y(x)**: Y absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word has**:  
  - **S in position 4**.  
  - **At least two S's** (one fixed at position 4, another elsewhere).  
  - **U present**, but **not in position 2** (so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S for additional positions).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Constraints**:  
  - Must have **S in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  
  - Must include **at least one more S** (positions 1, 2, or 5) and **U** (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Prioritize** words that:  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L).  
  - Avoid redundant guesses (e.g., re-testing position 3 for S).  
- **Selected word: SLUSH**:  
  - **S** in position 1 (tests for additional S).  
  - **L** in position 2 (new consonant).  
  - **U** in position 3 (allowed, since U cannot be in position 2).  
  - **S** in position 4 (fixed).  
  - **H** in position 5 (new consonant).  
- **Why SLUSH?**  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: partially melted snow).  
  - Tests 3 new letters (L, H) and confirms S/U positions.  
  - Aligns with all constraints and feedback.",Guess 4: slush -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,BLUSH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to gather maximum information.
 Some popular starting words in word games are: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc., because they contain common letters and distinct letters.

 I am going to choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three common vowels? Actually, it has one vowel 'A' and one sometimes vowel 'E'. But note: the word CRANE has the letters C, R, A, N, E.
 - It has common consonants: C, R, N.
 - All letters are distinct, which helps in getting more information.

 However, note that the feedback format requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid English word (meaning: a type of bird or a machine for lifting).

 Alternatively, other words like ""SLATE"" are also good. But since the example used in the problem had the letter 'B', I might avoid that for now.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Important: We must output the guess in the specified format.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all).
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.

 Now, since none of these letters are present, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters and uses other common letters.

 Let's think about common letters in 5-letter words: We've ruled out C, R, A, N, E. Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.

 Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Possible choices: 
   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:
   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.

 Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let's try a word with 5 new common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.

 The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let's think of one that has more vowels? We've only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.

 Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.

 The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that's five new letters.

 Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.

 But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven't tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.

 However, we have only 6 tries and we've used one, so let's go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.

 Some options:
 - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.
 - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.

 Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let's include U? Maybe later.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.

 Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.

 Let's prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven't tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.

 We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.

 But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.

 How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.

 Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.

 To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.

 So I choose: ""MOIST""

 Why MOIST?
 - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven't tried any of them.
 - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).

 Now, output the guess.The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  

A strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:
- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  
- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  
- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)
 This means:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.
   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).

 Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 We also know the fourth letter is S.

 Now, we need to make a third guess that:
   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it's correct and in position).
   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 What letters are left? We have the English alphabet minus the absent ones.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
 Remaining vowels: U (and sometimes Y).

 But note: we have used the vowels A, E, I, O (all absent) so the only vowel left is U (and Y, which can be a vowel).

 So the word must contain U or Y as a vowel? Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.

 We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.

 Let's list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):

 Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)
 Position 2: same set
 Position 3: same set
 Position 4: S (fixed)
 Position 5: same set

 We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.

 Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Let's think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.

 Some examples:
   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S's? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don't know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S's. Also, we haven't tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).

   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven't tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.

   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S's, then if we guess a word with two S's and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it's present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn't have a second S, then we get x for the other S.

   However, to keep it simple for now, let's avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don't know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don't use S in the fifth, we won't know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it's not S? 

   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.

   So let's try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _

   Some words that come to mind:
     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.

     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.

     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S

     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.

     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?

     - Examples: 
         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let's index: 
             Position 1: B
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.

         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?

     - Some words: 
         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? 
             Position 1: F
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> that's third
             Position 4: S -> that's fourth -> good.
             But we have two S's. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don't know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.

         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S's. Also, we haven't tested F, U, Y.

         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that's a new position. We might get feedback on that.

     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that's 6 letters, not 5.

     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.

     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> that's the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.

     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.

     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.

     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.

     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.

     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.

     - ""BUMPS"": same.

     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.

     - Let's try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

     - Words with pattern ???S?:

         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> 
             Position 1: D
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.

     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.

     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         Position 5: Y

         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).

     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> 
         Position 1: B
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.

     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.

     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? 

     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.

     - Examples: 
         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.
         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.
         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.
         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> 
             Position 1: L
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: S -> third
             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.
         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.

     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S -> third
         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.
         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.

     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.

     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.

     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.

     - Let's try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn't repeat S? 

     - Words: 
         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? 
         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.

     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.

     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.

     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: G
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: F -> not S.

     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> 
         Position 1: G
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: P -> not S.

     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.

     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.

     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> 
         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don't know if there is another S. 
         However, in this word: 
             Position 1: S
             Position 2: U
             Position 3: L
             Position 4: K -> not S.

     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.

     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn't work.

     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it's not common.

     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.

     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.

     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.

     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.

     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> 
         Position 1: Z
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: L
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? 

     - Let's go with ""GUSSY"": 
         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.
         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.

     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.

     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.

     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.

     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? 

     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": 
         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.

     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.

     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.

     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.

     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.

     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options. Or ""PUSSY"", but let's avoid that.

     - Another word: ""JUSKS"" — not a word.

     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.

     - ""SUSUS"" — not a word.

     - ""WUSSY"" — might be considered offensive? 

     - Let's try ""HUSKS"": H U S K S -> 
         Position 1: H
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: K -> not S.

     - ""MUSKS"" — M absent.

     - ""PUSHY"" — P U S H Y -> S in third.

     - I think we have to use a word with S in the fourth and accept that there might be another S? 

     - How about ""BASKS"" — A absent.

     - ""BESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""BUSTS"" — B U S T S -> T is absent (from second guess: T is x).

     - ""CUSKS"" — C absent.

     - ""DESKS"" — E absent.

     - ""GESTS"" — E absent.

     - ""JUSTS"" — J U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""LUSTS"" — L U S T S -> T absent.

     - ""RESTS"" — R and E absent.

     - ""TRUST"" — T and R absent.

     - ""USAGE"" — A and E absent.

     - ""USHER"" — E and R absent.

     - ""USUAL"" — A absent.

     - ""USURP"" — U S U R P -> R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — U S U R Y -> R absent.

     - ""VESTA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""YESTY"" — E absent.

     - ""ZESTS"" — E absent.

     - I found: ""FUSSY"" and ""GUSSY"" are the only ones that seem to fit? 

     - Let me check ""GUSSY"": 
         It is a valid word. It means to make gaudy or showy.

     - Also, ""PUDUS"" is a word (a type of deer) but it's P U D U S -> 
         Position 1: P
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""PULIS"" — P U L I S -> I absent.

     - ""PUNAS"" — U N A S -> N and A absent.

     - ""PURLS"" — P U R L S -> R absent.

     - ""PUTTS"" — T absent.

     - ""PYXES"" — E absent.

     - ""QUASS"" — Q U A S S -> A absent.

     - ""SUSED"" — E absent.

     - ""TUTUS"" — T absent.

     - ""UNSUN"" — U N S U N -> N absent.

     - ""URUBU"" — U R U B U -> R absent.

     - ""USNEA"" — E and A absent.

     - ""USQUE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURE"" — E absent.

     - ""USURP"" — R absent.

     - ""USURY"" — R absent.

     - ""WUDUS"" — W U D U S -> 
         Position 1: W
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: D
         Position 4: U -> not S.

     - ""YUKOS"" — O absent.

     - ""YULAN"" — A and N absent.

     - ""YUPON"" — O and N absent.

     - ""ZEBUS"" — E absent.

     - ""ZOBUS"" — O absent.

     - ""ZUPAN"" — A and N absent.

     - After this, I think ""GUSSY"" is acceptable.

     - But note: we are using two S's. We know the fourth is S, so we'll get:
         - Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓; if it has S but not in 3, we get -; if no other S, we get x.
         - We also test G, U, Y.

     - Alternatively, we can use ""FUSSY"" (which is more common) but it has F instead of G.

     - Let's choose ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y.

     - Why not ""HUSSY""? It might be sensitive, so let's avoid.

     - ""FUSSY"" is defined as excessively particular or hard to please.

     - So I'll go with ""FUSSY"".

     - But wait, in ""FUSSY"", the fourth letter is S? 
         Position 1: F
         Position 2: U
         Position 3: S
         Position 4: S -> yes, the fourth is S.

     - So the guess is ""FUSSY"".

 However, note that we are using the letter S in position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is correct, so we'll get a ✓ for position 4. For position 3, we don't know.

 But we are also testing F, U, Y.

 If we get feedback that position 3 is ✓, then we know there are two S's and the third is also S. If it's -, then there is an S but not in third. If x, then no other S.

 This is acceptable.

 So let's guess ""FUSSY"".

 But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. F, U, S, S, Y: 
   - F: not in the absent list -> new.
   - U: not in the absent list -> new.
   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).
   - Y: new.

 So it's valid.

 Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S. But we are struggling to find one.

 Another word: ""DUSTS"" -> D U S T S -> T is absent.

 ""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> T is absent.

 ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y -> T absent.

 ""MUSTY"": M and T absent.

 ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> same as before.

 ""RUSHY"": R absent.

 ""TUSHY"": T absent.

 So I think ""FUSSY"" is a reasonable choice.

 Let's go with that.After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Only **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **S is in position 4** of the secret word.  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (cannot be used).  
3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. The word must have **S in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize words with **S fixed at position 4** and new, high-frequency letters (e.g., F, U, Y) to test.  
- After extensive search, **FUSSY** fits:  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: excessively particular).  
  - Uses available letters: F (new), U (new), S (known in position 4), Y (new).  
  - Tests for potential double-S (position 3) and new consonants/vowel (U, Y).

<guess>fussy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: fussy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) S(-) S(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess: ""fussy"" -> F(x), U(-), S(-), S(✓), Y(x)

 Interpretation:
   - F(x): F is not in the word at all.
   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S(-): The first S (in position 3) is in the word but not in position 3. But note: we already know S is in position 4 (from guess 2). So this means there is another S in the word? Actually, the feedback for the S in position 3 is that it is present but not in that position. Since we have two S's in the guess, and one of them (position 4) is correct, the other S (position 3) is present but in a different position? But wait, the feedback says S(-) for position 3 and S(✓) for position 4.

   However, note that the secret word might have only one S? But if it has only one S, then the S in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the only S is already correctly placed in position 4? But the feedback for position 3 is S(-), which means it is present but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S's: one in position 4 and at least one more elsewhere.

   But the feedback for the first S (position 3) is a dash (-), meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. And the second S (position 4) is a check (✓), meaning it is correct and in position.

   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.

 So now we know:
   - The secret word has at least two S's: one fixed in position 4, and at least one more in a position that is not 3 (and not 2, because we have U in position 2 and it's not S, and not 1 or 5 because we don't have S there in this guess? Actually, we only have S in positions 3 and 4 in this guess).

   But note: the dash for S in position 3 means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3, 4 (but position 4 is already taken by the correct one). Since we have two S's in the guess, and one is correctly placed at 4, the other S (at 3) is not in the word? Or is it that the secret word has two S's, one at position 4 and one at another position, but not at 3? The dash for position 3 indicates that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3. Since we know there is one at 4, that satisfies? But actually, the feedback for the S at position 3 is that it is present (so there is at least one S that is not at position 4? Or does the dash for position 3 refer to the same S that is at position 4? 

   Let me clarify the rules: 
     - The feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, we get:
         ✓: correct letter in correct position.
         -: the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
         x: the letter is not in the word.

   For ""fussy"":
     - Position 1: F -> x (not in word)
     - Position 2: U -> - (in word, but not in position 2)
     - Position 3: S -> - (in word, but not in position 3)  [This means there is an S in the word that is not at position 3. But note: we also have an S at position 4 that is correct. So the S at position 3 is being considered as a separate occurrence?]

   How does the game handle duplicate letters?
     - Typically, if the secret word has two S's, and you guess two S's, then:
         - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
         - The other S, if it is in a position where the secret has S, then it gets - (if that position is not the same) or ✓ (if same). But if the secret has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked x.

   In this case, we have:
     - Secret must have at least two S's because:
         - The S at position 4 is correct (so one S at position 4).
         - The S at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position. That means there is another S in the secret word (at least one more) that is not at position 3.

   Therefore, the secret word has at least two S's.

   Also, U is present but not in position 2.

   And F and Y are absent.

   So update the absent letters: 
     From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
     From guess 2: M, O, I, T
     From guess 3: F, Y

   So absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.

   Present letters: 
     S (at least two, one fixed at position 4), and U (somewhere, not position 2).

   Also, from the feedback, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2.

   Now, the available letters are: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. And we have U and S (which we already know).

   We need to form a word that:
     - Has S in position 4.
     - Has at least two S's (so one more S in a position that is not 4 and not 3? But we don't know the position of the other S yet).
     - Has U, but not in position 2.
     - Uses only the available letters and the known present letters.

   The word must have the pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
   And it must contain at least one more S and one U.

   Let's think of possible positions for the other S and U.

   The other S can be in position 1, 2, or 5? (since position 3 we already tried and it was not there, and position 4 is fixed).

   Also, U is in the word but not in position 2, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

   We have to avoid the absent letters.

   Let's try to list possible words.

   Pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]

   Constraints:
     - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S? but we are going to put S in one of these positions? Actually, we need at least one more S, so one of these positions must be S? Or could there be more? But we know at least two S's total).

   But note: we are allowed to use S in other positions? Yes, because we know it's present multiple times.

   So the letters for positions 1,2,3,5 can be from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S.

   However, we must include at least one more S (besides position 4) and one U.

   Let's consider:

   Option 1: Put the second S in position 1.
      Then the word: S _ _ S _
      And we need a U in one of the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not 2? Actually, U can be in 2? Wait, the feedback for U in guess 3 was that it is not in position 2. But that doesn't prevent U from being in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, no: the dash for U in position 2 means that U is in the word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in position 2.

      Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if we put S in position 1, then U cannot be in 1. So U must be in 3 or 5.

      So pattern: S [not U and not S?] [possibly U] S [possibly U]

      But we have to fill position 2 and 3 and 5 with available letters, and one of 3 or 5 must be U? Or we could have U in position 1? But position 1 is S, so not.

      So we need U in position 3 or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""SUSUS"" -> but we have U in position 2? Not allowed because U cannot be in position 2. And also, we have to avoid absent letters. ""SUSUS"" has U in position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is U -> not allowed.

      How about ""S"" in position 1, then position 2 must not be U and not be an absent letter. Then position 3 can be U, and position 5 can be something.

        Example: ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> is that a word? Not really.

      Or ""S H U S P"" -> ""SHUSP"" -> not a word.

   Option 2: Put the second S in position 5.
      Then the word: _ _ _ S S
      And we need U in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is S, so U must be in 1 or 3.

      Example: 
        - ""U B S S S"" -> but we need two S's: we have three? The word would be ""UBSSS"" -> not a valid word? And also, we have to fill with available letters.

      More realistically: 
        - ""B U S S S"" -> ""BUSSS"" -> not a word.
        - ""D U S S S"" -> same.

      How about: ""L U S S S"" -> ""LUSSS"" -> no.

      Or with U in position 1: ""U B L S S"" -> ""UBLSS"" -> not a word.

      Or ""U P S S S"" -> ""UPSSS"" -> no.

   Option 3: Put the second S in position 3? But wait, in guess 3 we had S in position 3 and it was marked as dash, meaning that the secret word does not have an S in position 3. So we cannot put S in position 3? Because the feedback told us that position 3 is not S. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But position 2: we are about to try? 

   However, note: the feedback for position 3 in guess 3 was that S is present but not in position 3. That doesn't prevent us from putting S in position 3 again? Actually, we know it's not there, so we should avoid putting S in position 3. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

   But we just tried position 1 and 5 and didn't find common words.

   Option 4: Put the second S in position 2? 
      Then the word: _ S _ S _
      And U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because position 2 is S now, and U cannot be in 2 anyway).

      So U can be in 1, 3, or 5.

      Example: 
        - ""U S B S K"" -> ""USB SK"" -> not a word.
        - ""B S U S K"" -> ""BSU SK"" -> not a word.

      How about ""ASSUME"" -> but A and E absent.

      ""ISSUE"" -> I and E absent.

      ""ESSUX"" -> E absent.

      ""ASSURE"" -> A, R, E absent.

      ""ISSUED"" -> I, E, D? D is available, but the word is 6 letters.

      We need 5-letter words.

      ""PSSST"" -> not a word.

      ""ESSAY"" -> E and A absent.

      ""ASSET"" -> A, E, T absent.

      ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, Y absent.

      ""GASSY"" -> G? But we have G available? But wait, ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""FUSSY"" we already tried.

      ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> but Y is absent, and we are putting S in position 2? In ""HUSSY"", the S's are in positions 3 and 4. We need S in position 2 and 4.

      How about ""BUSSES"" -> 6 letters.

      ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""LASSY"": L A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""MASSY"": M and Y absent.

      ""PASSY"": P A S S Y -> A and Y absent.

      ""TASSY"": T and Y absent.

      ""WUSSY"": W U S S Y -> but Y is absent.

      ""JUSSI"" -> not a word.

      ""SISSY"": S I S S Y -> I and Y absent.

      ""SUSES"": S U S E S -> E absent.

      ""SUSUS"" -> not a word.

      ""SUSPS"" -> not a word.

   This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the secret word might have more than two S's? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we might have the U in position 1 or 5 and the second S in position 1 or 5.

   Let me try to list words that have S in position 4 and at least one more S, and U somewhere (not position 2), and avoid absent letters.

   We can use a word list? But we don't have one, so we have to think.

   Another idea: the word ""SUDDS"": 
        S U D D S -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: U -> but U cannot be in position 2? Because in guess 3, U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning U is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

   How about ""SUDDS"" has U in position 2 -> not allowed.

   ""SUSUD"" -> not a word.

   ""USURE"" -> E absent.

   ""USURP"" -> R absent.

   ""USUAL"" -> A absent.

   ""USUFS"" -> not a word.

   ""USULU"" -> not a word.

   ""USQUE"" -> E absent.

   ""USNEA"" -> E and A absent.

   ""USARA"" -> A absent.

   ""USAGE"" -> A and E absent.

   ""USHER"" -> E and R absent.

   ""USNIC"" -> C absent.

   ""USENT"" -> E and N and T absent.

   I'm struggling. Let's try a different approach: put U in position 1 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: U _ _ S S

   Then we need to fill position 2 and 3 with available letters (B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and possibly S? But we already have two S's (position 4 and 5), so we don't need more.

   Example: ""U B D S S"" -> ""UBDSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U G G S S"" -> ""UGGSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U P P S S"" -> ""UPPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U L L S S"" -> ""ULLSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S L S S"" -> ""USLSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 1 and S in position 2? But position 2 is not allowed for U? No, U is in position 1, which is allowed. But we are also putting S in position 2? That would be the second S? But we have S in position 4 and 5 and also 2? That's three S's. And the word would be ""USLSS"" -> not a word.

   How about ""U S _ S _"" but then we have S in position 2, which is not allowed for U? But U is in 1. However, we are trying to avoid S in position 2? We don't know if it's allowed or not. We only know that U is not in position 2, but S can be in position 2.

   But in this pattern, if we put S in position 2, then the word is ""U S ? S ?"", and we need to fill the third and fifth.

   Example: ""U S B S S"" -> ""USBSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S P S S"" -> ""USPSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S W S S"" -> ""USWSS"" -> not a word.

   ""U S G S S"" -> ""USGSS"" -> not a word.

   This is not working.

   What if we put the second S in position 1 and U in position 5?
      Pattern: S _ _ S U

   Then fill position 2 and 3 with available letters.

   Example: ""S B D S U"" -> ""SBDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H D S U"" -> ""SHDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K D S U"" -> ""SKDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P D S U"" -> ""SPDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S L D S U"" -> ""SLDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V D S U"" -> ""SVDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W D S U"" -> ""SWDSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S G G S U"" -> ""SGGSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P L S U"" -> ""SPLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S K L S U"" -> ""SKLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S H L S U"" -> ""SHLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S V L S U"" -> ""SVLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S W L S U"" -> ""SWLSU"" -> not a word.

   ""S P P S U"" -> ""SPPSU"" -> not a word.

   I am considering that the secret word might have U in position 3 and the second S in position 5.

   Pattern: _ _ U S S

   Then position 1 and 2 are to be filled.

   Example: ""B L U S S"" -> ""BLUSS"" -> not a word.

   ""B U U S S"" -> ""BUUSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 2 is not allowed? We can have U in position 2? But the feedback said U is not in position 2, but it can be in other positions. However, this has U in position 2 and 3? But the feedback only said U is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about position 3. So U can be in position 3.

   But in ""BUUSS"", we have U in position 2 and 3. Position 2 is not allowed for U? The feedback from guess 3: U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning that there is a U in the word, but not in position 2. So if the secret word has U in position 2, that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the secret word does not have U in position 2. So we cannot have U in position 2 in our guess either? No, we can, but it would be marked as absent or dash? 

   But in our guess, if we put U in position 2, and the secret word has U but not in position 2, then we would get a dash for that U? Or if the secret word has only one U and it's in position 3, then the U in position 2 would be marked as dash? But that would be inconsistent with the secret word not having U in position 2. 

   Actually, the feedback for a letter in the guess is independent. If we guess U in position 2, and the secret word has U in position 3, then we would get a dash for position 2.

   But in this case, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2. So if we guess U in position 2, we will get a dash (because U is in the word but not in position 2). 

   However, we already know that, so it doesn't give us new information. We want to test new positions.

   So back to pattern _ _ U S S:

   We can try:
     ""B G U S S"" -> ""BGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""D G U S S"" -> ""DGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G G U S S"" -> ""GGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""H G U S S"" -> ""HGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""J G U S S"" -> ""JGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""K G U S S"" -> ""KGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""L G U S S"" -> ""LGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""P G U S S"" -> ""PGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""V G U S S"" -> ""VGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""W G U S S"" -> ""WGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""X G U S S"" -> ""XGUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""Z G U S S"" -> ""ZGUSS"" -> not a word.

   Or with different letter in position 1:

     ""G B U S S"" -> ""GBUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G D U S S"" -> ""GDUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""G H U S S"" -> ""GHUSS"" -> not a word.
     ""GHUSS"" might be ""ghus"" (a type of wild sheep)? But it's not a standard word. Typically, it's ""ghus"" is not a 5-letter word.

   How about "" issue"" but I and E absent.

   I am considering the word ""truss"" -> T and R absent.

   ""bless"" -> E absent.

   ""dress"" -> E and R absent.

   ""guess"" -> E absent.

   ""jess"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""kiss"" -> not 5.

   ""loss"" -> not 5.

   ""mess"" -> not 5.

   ""press"" -> P R E -> R and E absent.

   ""tress"" -> T, R, E absent.

   ""buss"" -> not 5 letters.

   ""cuss"" -> C absent.

   ""fuss"" -> F absent.

   ""muss"" -> M absent.

   ""puss"" -> ""puss"" is 4 letters.

   ""wuss"" -> ""wuss"" is 4 letters.

   ""luser"" -> E and R absent.

   I am considering that the second S might be in position 1, and U in position 3.

   Pattern: S _ U S _

   Example: ""S B U S K"" -> ""SBUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S G U S K"" -> ""SGUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S K"" -> ""SHUSK"" -> valid word! ""husk"" is a word, but ""SHUSK"" is not. ""HUSK"" is 4 letters.

   ""S K U S K"" -> ""SKUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S L U S K"" -> ""SLUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S P U S K"" -> ""SPUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S V U S K"" -> ""SVUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S W U S K"" -> ""SWUSK"" -> not a word.

   ""S B U S H"" -> ""SBUSH"" -> not a word.

   ""S H U S H"" -> ""SHUSH"" -> valid word! ""SHUSH""

   Let's check ""SHUSH"":
     - S in position 1, H in 2, U in 3, S in 4, H in 5.
     - We know the secret word has S in position 4 -> matches.
     - It has two S's: positions 1 and 4.
     - It has U in position 3 -> which is allowed (U not in position 2).
     - Letters: S, H, U, S, H.
     - Check absent letters: H is not in the absent list, so it's available.
     - The word ""shush"" is a valid English word (meaning: to urge to be quiet).

   Now, does it meet all?
     - Position 4 is S -> correct.
     - It has at least two S's: yes.
     - U is in the word, not in position 2: it's in position 3.
     - Avoids absent letters: S, H, U are not absent.

   But note: we have H in position 2 and 5. We don't know if H is in the word or not. We haven't tested H before.

   Also, the feedback from guess 3: we had F, U, S, S, Y. We know U is present, S is present, F and Y are absent. We don't have information on H.

   So ""SHUSH"" seems to be a valid guess.

   Let's see if there are other possibilities.

   Another word: ""SLUSH"" -> but L is available, and U in position 3. ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> 
        Position 1: S
        Position 2: L
        Position 3: U
        Position 4: S
        Position 5: H
        This also has two S's and U in position 3.

   ""SLUSH"" is a word (meaning: partially melted snow).

   So we have at least two candidates: ""SHUSH"" and ""SLUSH"".

   We need to choose one that maximizes information. We want to test new letters.

   In ""SHUSH"", we are using H twice. We haven't tested H before, so we are testing H.

   In ""SLUSH"", we are testing L and H.

   Since we have more letters to test, ""SLUSH"" tests two new letters (L and H) while ""SHUSH"" tests only H (but twice).

   So ""SLUSH"" might be better.

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters. Both are valid.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have H or not. We don't know.

   Given that we have limited guesses, let's go with ""SLUSH"".

   But wait, in ""SLUSH"", the second S is in position 1 and 4. We know position 4 is S, and position 1 is being tested. The feedback for position 1 will tell us if there is an S in position 1 or not.

   Similarly, we test L in position 2 and H in position 5.

   So I think ""SLUSH"" is a good guess.

   Let's output that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  
2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T absent.  
3. **Guess 3: FUSSY** →  
   - **F(x)**: F absent.  
   - **U(-)**: U present but not in position 2.  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 3 (indicating at least one **additional S** besides position 4).  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - **Y(x)**: Y absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word has**:  
  - **S in position 4**.  
  - **At least two S's** (one fixed at position 4, another elsewhere).  
  - **U present**, but **not in position 2** (so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S for additional positions).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Constraints**:  
  - Must have **S in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  
  - Must include **at least one more S** (positions 1, 2, or 5) and **U** (positions 1, 3, or 5).  
- **Prioritize** words that:  
  - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., H, L).  
  - Avoid redundant guesses (e.g., re-testing position 3 for S).  
- **Selected word: SLUSH**:  
  - **S** in position 1 (tests for additional S).  
  - **L** in position 2 (new consonant).  
  - **U** in position 3 (allowed, since U cannot be in position 2).  
  - **S** in position 4 (fixed).  
  - **H** in position 5 (new consonant).  
- **Why SLUSH?**  
  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: partially melted snow).  
  - Tests 3 new letters (L, H) and confirms S/U positions.  
  - Aligns with all constraints and feedback.

Actually, it has one vowel \'A\' and one sometimes vowel \'E\'. But note: the word CRANE has the letters C, R, A, N, E.\n - It has common consonants: C, R, N.\n - All letters are distinct, which helps in getting more information.\n\n However, note that the feedback format requires a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid English word (meaning: a type of bird or a machine for lifting).\n\n Alternatively, other words like ""SLATE"" are also good.

Some other common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Our goal is to cover as many new common letters as possible with distinct letters to gather more information.\n\n Avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Possible choices: \n   - We can try words with S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n Example of good starting words after eliminating C,R,A,N,E:\n   Words like ""SLOTH"", ""BUILT"", ""POUTY"", ""QUIET"", etc.\n\n However, we must ensure the word is valid and 5 letters.\n\n Also note: In the example game, the secret word was ""BRISK"", but that had R which we know is absent — so our secret word is different.\n\n Since we have eliminated 5 letters, let\'s try a word with 5 new common letters.\n\n Consider: S, T, L, I, O are common.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" might be an option, but let\'s think of one that has more vowels? We\'ve only used A and E so far? Wait, we eliminated A, E, so vowels left are I, O, U.\n\n Another word: ""OUPHS"" — not very common, might not be ideal.\n\n The word ""LUMPS"": has L, U, M, P, S — that\'s five new letters.\n\n Or ""SPLIT"": has S, P, L, I, T — avoiding E,A,R,N,C. Wait, R is eliminated, so S,P,L,I,T are safe? Yes, because R is not used.\n\n But ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T — all letters we haven\'t tried. However, note that if the secret word has double letters, we might miss that? But for now, we want distinct letters to test.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries and we\'ve used one, so let\'s go with a word that has common letters and avoids the ones we know are not present.\n\n Some options:\n - ""SPLIT"": letters S,P,L,I,T.\n - ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T — includes two vowels (O,I) and three consonants.\n\n Given that we have only vowels I and O left (since A,E are out, and Y might be considered), let\'s include U? Maybe later.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it includes common letters M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S,H,O,U,T — has H and U too, but H and U might be less common? But H is reasonably common.\n\n Another possibility: ""PIOUS"" — P,I,O,U,S — but U is less common than I and O.\n\n Let\'s prioritize letters by frequency in English: The most frequent letters that we haven\'t tried are: S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, etc.\n\n We can use a word that includes S, T, L, O, I? That would be 5 letters. There is ""TOILS"": T,O,I,L,S.\n\n But let me check if ""TOILS"" is valid? Yes. It means to work hard.\n\n How about ""SLIPT"" — an archaic past tense of slip? Not commonly used. Better to stick with common words.\n\n Another word: ""TULIP"" — T,U,L,I,P. That uses U.\n\n To maximize vowel coverage: We have only O,I,U available. So using both O and I might be better.\n\n So I choose: ""MOIST""\n\n Why MOIST?\n - It has M, O, I, S, T — all letters are distinct and we haven\'t tried any of them.\n - It covers two vowels (O,I) and three consonants (M,S,T).\n\n Now, output the guess.The first guess ""CRANE"" was entirely incorrect, meaning the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. Therefore, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters and uses other common English letters to maximize information. Remaining common letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, U, and H.  \n\nA strong second guess should prioritize frequency and vowel coverage since vowels (like O or I) are critical. The word **MOIST** fits well:\n- Uses letters M, O, I, S, T — all distinct and untested.  \n- Covers two high-frequency vowels (O and I) and three consonants.  \n- High information potential, as these letters appear often in 5-letter words.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the second guess: ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(✓), T(x)\n This means:\n   - S is in the word and in the correct position (specifically, the fourth letter, because S is the fourth letter in ""moist"").\n   - M, O, I, T are not in the word at all.\n\n So now we know:\n   - The secret word has the letter S in the fourth position.\n   - The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess).\n\n Therefore, the absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\n We also know the fourth letter is S.\n\n Now, we need to make a third guess that:\n   - Has S as the fourth letter (since we know it\'s correct and in position).\n   - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\n What letters are left?

Not necessarily, because some words have no vowels (like crypt, but that has Y) — but typically we need vowels. However, we have Y available.\n\n We must form a 5-letter word with S in the fourth position and using only the remaining letters.\n\n Let\'s list possible letters for each position (with position 4 fixed as S):\n\n Position 1: can be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but must form a word)\n Position 2: same set\n Position 3: same set\n Position 4: S (fixed)\n Position 5: same set\n\n We need to choose a word that uses these letters and has S in the fourth position.\n\n Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common words that have S in the fourth position and use the available letters.\n\n Some examples:\n   - BUSKS: B U S K S -> but we have two S\'s? The fourth is S, and the fifth is S? But we don\'t know if S can be repeated? The feedback doesn\'t indicate if there are multiple, but we know at least one S is in position 4. However, BUSKS has two S\'s. Also, we haven\'t tested B, U, K yet. But note: the word must be valid. BUSKS is a word (meaning: to prepare flax by beating).\n\n   - However, we have to avoid the absent letters. BUSKS: B, U, S, K, S. The letters are B, U, K, S. We haven\'t tried B, U, K. And S we know is in.\n\n   - But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. For example, if the secret word has two S\'s, then if we guess a word with two S\'s and one is in the correct position, we might get one ✓ and one x? But in our case, we know the fourth is S, so if we put S in the fourth, we get ✓. If we put S in another position and it\'s present but not in that position, we get -. But if the word doesn\'t have a second S, then we get x for the other S.\n\n   However, to keep it simple for now, let\'s avoid using S again in the fifth position? Because we don\'t know if there is a second S. We can use a word with only one S (in the fourth position) to avoid confusion? But if we don\'t use S in the fifth, we won\'t know if there is a second S. But we have limited guesses. Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat S and then if we get a letter in the fifth that is present, we know it\'s not S? \n\n   Since we are trying to maximize information, it might be better to use a word with all new letters and only the known S in the fourth.\n\n   So let\'s try to form a word with 4 new letters and S in the fourth.\n\n   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   We need a word of the form: _ _ _ S _\n\n   Some words that come to mind:\n     - ""PULPS"": P U L P S -> fourth letter is P? No, we need S in fourth. PULPS: positions: P(1), U(2), L(3), P(4) -> but we need S in fourth, so not this.\n\n     - ""FUSED"": but E is absent, so not allowed.\n\n     - ""BULKS"": B U L K S -> positions: B(1), U(2), L(3), K(4) -> no, we need S in fourth. In ""BULKS"", the S is the fifth, so the fourth is K. So we want the fourth to be S, so the word must have the pattern: ...S\n\n     - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word ends with the fourth letter? Actually, the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word, positions: 1,2,3,4,5. So the fourth is the one before the last.\n\n     - Words ending in ""S"" are common? But we need the fourth letter to be S, so the fifth can be any letter. So the pattern is: ???S?\n\n     - Examples: \n         - ""BUSKS"": B U S K S -> but the fourth letter is the third? Let\'s index: \n             Position 1: B\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> that\'s the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S.\n\n         - We need the fourth letter to be S, so the word must have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]\n\n     - So the word is: ? ? ? S ?\n\n     - Some words: \n         - ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y -> but the fourth letter is S? \n             Position 1: F\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> that\'s third\n             Position 4: S -> that\'s fourth -> good.\n             But we have two S\'s. And we know S is in the fourth, but we don\'t know if there is another S. Also, Y is available.\n\n         - However, ""FUSSY"" has U and Y, which are available. But we are using two S\'s. Also, we haven\'t tested F, U, Y.\n\n         - But note: we are forced to use S in the fourth, and if we use S in the third, that\'s a new position. We might get feedback on that.\n\n     - Another word: ""PULSES"" -> but that\'s 6 letters, not 5.\n\n     - ""BULGY"": B U L G Y -> but no S? We must have S in the fourth? So not.\n\n     - ""HUSKY"": H U S K Y -> \n         Position 1: H\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> that\'s the third, not the fourth. We need the fourth to be S? So no.\n\n     - We need the fourth letter to be S. So the word must have the pattern: ...S. meaning the fourth character is S.\n\n     - How about ""FOCUS""? But O and C are absent.\n\n     - ""JUMPS"": J U M P S -> but M is absent.\n\n     - ""LUMPS"": L U M P S -> M is absent.\n\n     - ""PUMPS"": P U M P S -> M absent.\n\n     - ""BUMPS"": same.\n\n     - We must avoid M, O, I, T, etc.\n\n     - Let\'s try with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n     - Words with pattern ???S?:\n\n         - ""DUSKS"": D U S K S -> \n             Position 1: D\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.\n\n         - We need the fourth to be S, so the third must be a different letter and the fourth is S.\n\n     - How about ""FUSED""? But E is absent.\n\n     - ""GUSSY"": G U S S Y -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third\n         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.\n         Position 5: Y\n\n         So ""GUSSY"" is a word (meaning: to make gaudy or showy). It uses G, U, S, S, Y. We know S is in the fourth, and we are also testing G, U, Y, and the third S (which might be present or not).\n\n     - Another word: ""BUSBY"": B U S B Y -> \n         Position 1: B\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third, not fourth.\n\n     - ""PUSHY"": P U S H Y -> again, S in third.\n\n     - It seems hard to find words with S in the fourth position? \n\n     - Let me think: words that end with ""S"" are common, but that would be the fifth position. We need the fourth to be S and then a fifth letter.\n\n     - Examples: \n         - ""TIMES"" -> T and E absent.\n         - ""GASES"" -> G A S E S -> A and E absent.\n         - ""BASSY"": B A S S Y -> A absent.\n         - ""LUSUS"": L U S U S -> \n             Position 1: L\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: S -> third\n             Position 4: U -> fourth is U, not S.\n         - ""FUSEL"": F U S E L -> E absent.\n\n     - How about ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> \n         Position 1: P\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S -> third\n         Position 4: S -> fourth -> good.\n         But note: this word might be sensitive? We should avoid if possible.\n\n     - ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> same pattern.\n\n     - ""JUSKS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.\n\n     - ""WUSHU"" — not common.\n\n     - ""YUKSY"" — not a word.\n\n     - Let\'s try a different approach: use a word that has S in the fourth position and doesn\'t repeat S? \n\n     - Words: \n         - ""GAUSS"" -> G A U S S -> A absent, and S in fifth? \n         - ""FUSEE"" -> E absent.\n\n     - ""BUDAS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""DUKES"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""FUGUS"" — F U G U S -> \n         Position 1: F\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: G\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - ""GULFS"" — G U L F S -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: F -> not S.\n\n     - ""GULPS"" — G U L P S -> \n         Position 1: G\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: P -> not S.\n\n     - ""HULKS"" — H U L K S -> \n         Position 1: H\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: K -> not S.\n\n     - ""JUMPS"" — M absent.\n\n     - ""PUMPS"" — M absent.\n\n     - ""PUNKS"" — P U N K S -> N is absent.\n\n     - ""QUIPS"" — Q U I P S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""SULKS"" — S U L K S -> \n         Position 1: S -> but we are trying to avoid S in other positions? But we don\'t know if there is another S. \n         However, in this word: \n             Position 1: S\n             Position 2: U\n             Position 3: L\n             Position 4: K -> not S.\n\n     - We need the fourth to be S. So the word must have the fourth letter as S.\n\n     - How about ""FUSSY"" again? Or ""HUSKY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n     - Another idea: ""LYSSA"" — but A absent and it\'s not common.\n\n     - ""PASSE"" — A and E absent.\n\n     - ""WASPS"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""WHOSO"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""YOURS"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""YUCKS"" — Y U C K S -> C absent.\n\n     - ""YUGAS"" — Y U G A S -> A absent.\n\n     - ""ZULUS"" — Z U L U S -> \n         Position 1: Z\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: L\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - This is difficult. Maybe we should consider using a word that has S in the fourth and one repeated S? \n\n     - Let\'s go with ""GUSSY"": \n         Letters: G, U, S, S, Y -> but we are using S twice. We know the fourth is S, so we\'ll get:\n            Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓, else if it has an S but not in 3, we get -, else x.\n         But we are testing G, U, Y as well.\n\n     - However, ""GUSSY"" might not be very common. Another word: ""PUDUS"" — not common.\n\n     - ""FUSED"" is out because of E.\n\n     - ""BUSED"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""MUSED"" — M and E absent.\n\n     - ""USUAL"" — U S U A L -> A absent and S is in second position.\n\n     - I found: ""BUSKS"" — but S is in third and fifth? \n\n     - Let me check the pattern for ""BUSKS"": \n         B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so the fourth is K, not S.\n\n     - How about ""DISKS"" — D I S K S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""LISPS"" — L I S P S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""WASMS"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""WHYSY"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""FUSSY"" seems to be one of the few options. Or ""PUSSY"", but let\'s avoid that.\n\n     - Another word: ""JUSKS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""KUSSO"" — not common.\n\n     - ""SUSUS"" — not a word.\n\n     - ""WUSSY"" — might be considered offensive? \n\n     - Let\'s try ""HUSKS"": H U S K S -> \n         Position 1: H\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S\n         Position 4: K -> not S.\n\n     - ""MUSKS"" — M absent.\n\n     - ""PUSHY"" — P U S H Y -> S in third.\n\n     - I think we have to use a word with S in the fourth and accept that there might be another S? \n\n     - How about ""BASKS"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""BESTS"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""BUSTS"" — B U S T S -> T is absent (from second guess: T is x).\n\n     - ""CUSKS"" — C absent.\n\n     - ""DESKS"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""GESTS"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""JUSTS"" — J U S T S -> T absent.\n\n     - ""LUSTS"" — L U S T S -> T absent.\n\n     - ""RESTS"" — R and E absent.\n\n     - ""TRUST"" — T and R absent.\n\n     - ""USAGE"" — A and E absent.\n\n     - ""USHER"" — E and R absent.\n\n     - ""USUAL"" — A absent.\n\n     - ""USURP"" — U S U R P -> R absent.\n\n     - ""USURY"" — U S U R Y -> R absent.\n\n     - ""VESTA"" — E and A absent.\n\n     - ""YESTY"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""ZESTS"" — E absent.\n\n     - I found: ""FUSSY"" and ""GUSSY"" are the only ones that seem to fit? \n\n     - Let me check ""GUSSY"": \n         It is a valid word. It means to make gaudy or showy.\n\n     - Also, ""PUDUS"" is a word (a type of deer) but it\'s P U D U S -> \n         Position 1: P\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: D\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - ""PULIS"" — P U L I S -> I absent.\n\n     - ""PUNAS"" — U N A S -> N and A absent.\n\n     - ""PURLS"" — P U R L S -> R absent.\n\n     - ""PUTTS"" — T absent.\n\n     - ""PYXES"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""QUASS"" — Q U A S S -> A absent.\n\n     - ""SUSED"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""TUTUS"" — T absent.\n\n     - ""UNSUN"" — U N S U N -> N absent.\n\n     - ""URUBU"" — U R U B U -> R absent.\n\n     - ""USNEA"" — E and A absent.\n\n     - ""USQUE"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""USURE"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""USURP"" — R absent.\n\n     - ""USURY"" — R absent.\n\n     - ""WUDUS"" — W U D U S -> \n         Position 1: W\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: D\n         Position 4: U -> not S.\n\n     - ""YUKOS"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""YULAN"" — A and N absent.\n\n     - ""YUPON"" — O and N absent.\n\n     - ""ZEBUS"" — E absent.\n\n     - ""ZOBUS"" — O absent.\n\n     - ""ZUPAN"" — A and N absent.\n\n     - After this, I think ""GUSSY"" is acceptable.\n\n     - But note: we are using two S\'s. We know the fourth is S, so we\'ll get:\n         - Position 3: S -> if the secret word has an S in position 3, we get ✓; if it has S but not in 3, we get -; if no other S, we get x.\n         - We also test G, U, Y.\n\n     - Alternatively, we can use ""FUSSY"" (which is more common) but it has F instead of G.\n\n     - Let\'s choose ""FUSSY"": F U S S Y.\n\n     - Why not ""HUSSY""? It might be sensitive, so let\'s avoid.\n\n     - ""FUSSY"" is defined as excessively particular or hard to please.\n\n     - So I\'ll go with ""FUSSY"".\n\n     - But wait, in ""FUSSY"", the fourth letter is S? \n         Position 1: F\n         Position 2: U\n         Position 3: S\n         Position 4: S -> yes, the fourth is S.\n\n     - So the guess is ""FUSSY"".\n\n However, note that we are using the letter S in position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is correct, so we\'ll get a ✓ for position 4. For position 3, we don\'t know.\n\n But we are also testing F, U, Y.\n\n If we get feedback that position 3 is ✓, then we know there are two S\'s and the third is also S. If it\'s -, then there is an S but not in third. If x, then no other S.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n So let\'s guess ""FUSSY"".\n\n But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. F, U, S, S, Y: \n   - F: not in the absent list -> new.\n   - U: not in the absent list -> new.\n   - S: we know is present (but we are testing if there is another one).\n   - Y: new.\n\n So it\'s valid.\n\n Alternatively, if we want to avoid the double S, we might find a word with S in fourth and no other S. But we are struggling to find one.\n\n Another word: ""DUSTS"" -> D U S T S -> T is absent.\n\n ""GUSTY"": G U S T Y -> T is absent.\n\n ""LUSTY"": L U S T Y -> T absent.\n\n ""MUSTY"": M and T absent.\n\n ""PUSSY"": P U S S Y -> same as before.\n\n ""RUSHY"": R absent.\n\n ""TUSHY"": T absent.\n\n So I think ""FUSSY"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n Let\'s go with that.After analyzing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  \n- **Guess 2: MOIST** → Only **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T are absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **S is in position 4** of the secret word.  \n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T (cannot be used).  \n3. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. The word must have **S in the 4th position** (pattern: `_ _ _ S _`).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize words with **S fixed at position 4** and new, high-frequency letters (e.g., F, U, Y) to test.  \n- After extensive search, **FUSSY** fits:  \n  - Valid 5-letter word (meaning: excessively particular).  \n  - Uses available letters: F (new), U (new), S (known in position 4), Y (new).  \n  - Tests for potential double-S (position 3) and new consonants/vowel (U, Y).\n\n<guess>fussy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: fussy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) S(-) S(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess: ""fussy"" -> F(x), U(-), S(-), S(✓), Y(x)\n\n Interpretation:\n   - F(x): F is not in the word at all.\n   - U(-): U is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - S(-): The first S (in position 3) is in the word but not in position 3. But note: we already know S is in position 4 (from guess 2). So this means there is another S in the word? Actually, the feedback for the S in position 3 is that it is present but not in that position. Since we have two S\'s in the guess, and one of them (position 4) is correct, the other S (position 3) is present but in a different position? But wait, the feedback says S(-) for position 3 and S(✓) for position 4.\n\n   However, note that the secret word might have only one S? But if it has only one S, then the S in position 3 would be marked as absent (x) because the only S is already correctly placed in position 4? But the feedback for position 3 is S(-), which means it is present but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have at least two S\'s: one in position 4 and at least one more elsewhere.\n\n   But the feedback for the first S (position 3) is a dash (-), meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. And the second S (position 4) is a check (✓), meaning it is correct and in position.\n\n   - Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n\n So now we know:\n   - The secret word has at least two S\'s: one fixed in position 4, and at least one more in a position that is not 3 (and not 2, because we have U in position 2 and it\'s not S, and not 1 or 5 because we don\'t have S there in this guess? Actually, we only have S in positions 3 and 4 in this guess).\n\n   But note: the dash for S in position 3 means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3, 4 (but position 4 is already taken by the correct one). Since we have two S\'s in the guess, and one is correctly placed at 4, the other S (at 3) is not in the word? Or is it that the secret word has two S\'s, one at position 4 and one at another position, but not at 3? The dash for position 3 indicates that there is an S in the word that is not in position 3. Since we know there is one at 4, that satisfies? But actually, the feedback for the S at position 3 is that it is present (so there is at least one S that is not at position 4? Or does the dash for position 3 refer to the same S that is at position 4? \n\n   Let me clarify the rules: \n     - The feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, we get:\n         ✓: correct letter in correct position.\n         -: the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.\n         x: the letter is not in the word.\n\n   For ""fussy"":\n     - Position 1: F -> x (not in word)\n     - Position 2: U -> - (in word, but not in position 2)\n     - Position 3: S -> - (in word, but not in position 3)  [This means there is an S in the word that is not at position 3. But note: we also have an S at position 4 that is correct. So the S at position 3 is being considered as a separate occurrence?]\n\n   How does the game handle duplicate letters?\n     - Typically, if the secret word has two S\'s, and you guess two S\'s, then:\n         - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.\n         - The other S, if it is in a position where the secret has S, then it gets - (if that position is not the same) or ✓ (if same). But if the secret has only one S, then the second S in the guess would be marked x.\n\n   In this case, we have:\n     - Secret must have at least two S\'s because:\n         - The S at position 4 is correct (so one S at position 4).\n         - The S at position 3 is marked as present but wrong position. That means there is another S in the secret word (at least one more) that is not at position 3.\n\n   Therefore, the secret word has at least two S\'s.\n\n   Also, U is present but not in position 2.\n\n   And F and Y are absent.\n\n   So update the absent letters: \n     From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E\n     From guess 2: M, O, I, T\n     From guess 3: F, Y\n\n   So absent: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.\n\n   Present letters: \n     S (at least two, one fixed at position 4), and U (somewhere, not position 2).\n\n   Also, from the feedback, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2.\n\n   Now, the available letters are: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. And we have U and S (which we already know).\n\n   We need to form a word that:\n     - Has S in position 4.\n     - Has at least two S\'s (so one more S in a position that is not 4 and not 3? But we don\'t know the position of the other S yet).\n     - Has U, but not in position 2.\n     - Uses only the available letters and the known present letters.\n\n   The word must have the pattern: _ _ _ S _ \n   And it must contain at least one more S and one U.\n\n   Let\'s think of possible positions for the other S and U.\n\n   The other S can be in position 1, 2, or 5? (since position 3 we already tried and it was not there, and position 4 is fixed).\n\n   Also, U is in the word but not in position 2, so U can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\n   We have to avoid the absent letters.\n\n   Let\'s try to list possible words.\n\n   Pattern: [letter1][letter2][letter3] S [letter5]\n\n   Constraints:\n     - letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 are from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and S? but we are going to put S in one of these positions? Actually, we need at least one more S, so one of these positions must be S? Or could there be more? But we know at least two S\'s total).\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use S in other positions? Yes, because we know it\'s present multiple times.\n\n   So the letters for positions 1,2,3,5 can be from: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, S.\n\n   However, we must include at least one more S (besides position 4) and one U.\n\n   Let\'s consider:\n\n   Option 1: Put the second S in position 1.\n      Then the word: S _ _ S _\n      And we need a U in one of the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not 2? Actually, U can be in 2? Wait, the feedback for U in guess 3 was that it is not in position 2. But that doesn\'t prevent U from being in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, no: the dash for U in position 2 means that U is in the word but not in position 2. So U cannot be in position 2.\n\n      Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But if we put S in position 1, then U cannot be in 1. So U must be in 3 or 5.\n\n      So pattern: S [not U and not S?] [possibly U] S [possibly U]\n\n      But we have to fill position 2 and 3 and 5 with available letters, and one of 3 or 5 must be U? Or we could have U in position 1? But position 1 is S, so not.\n\n      So we need U in position 3 or 5.\n\n      Example: \n        - ""SUSUS"" -> but we have U in position 2? Not allowed because U cannot be in position 2. And also, we have to avoid absent letters. ""SUSUS"" has U in position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is U -> not allowed.\n\n      How about ""S"" in position 1, then position 2 must not be U and not be an absent letter. Then position 3 can be U, and position 5 can be something.\n\n        Example: ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> is that a word? Not really.\n\n      Or ""S H U S P"" -> ""SHUSP"" -> not a word.\n\n   Option 2: Put the second S in position 5.\n      Then the word: _ _ _ S S\n      And we need U in position 1, 3, or 5? But position 5 is S, so U must be in 1 or 3.\n\n      Example: \n        - ""U B S S S"" -> but we need two S\'s: we have three? The word would be ""UBSSS"" -> not a valid word? And also, we have to fill with available letters.\n\n      More realistically: \n        - ""B U S S S"" -> ""BUSSS"" -> not a word.\n        - ""D U S S S"" -> same.\n\n      How about: ""L U S S S"" -> ""LUSSS"" -> no.\n\n      Or with U in position 1: ""U B L S S"" -> ""UBLSS"" -> not a word.\n\n      Or ""U P S S S"" -> ""UPSSS"" -> no.\n\n   Option 3: Put the second S in position 3? But wait, in guess 3 we had S in position 3 and it was marked as dash, meaning that the secret word does not have an S in position 3. So we cannot put S in position 3? Because the feedback told us that position 3 is not S. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5? But position 2: we are about to try? \n\n   However, note: the feedback for position 3 in guess 3 was that S is present but not in position 3. That doesn\'t prevent us from putting S in position 3 again? Actually, we know it\'s not there, so we should avoid putting S in position 3. So the second S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\n   But we just tried position 1 and 5 and didn\'t find common words.\n\n   Option 4: Put the second S in position 2? \n      Then the word: _ S _ S _\n      And U must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because position 2 is S now, and U cannot be in 2 anyway).\n\n      So U can be in 1, 3, or 5.\n\n      Example: \n        - ""U S B S K"" -> ""USB SK"" -> not a word.\n        - ""B S U S K"" -> ""BSU SK"" -> not a word.\n\n      How about ""ASSUME"" -> but A and E absent.\n\n      ""ISSUE"" -> I and E absent.\n\n      ""ESSUX"" -> E absent.\n\n      ""ASSURE"" -> A, R, E absent.\n\n      ""ISSUED"" -> I, E, D? D is available, but the word is 6 letters.\n\n      We need 5-letter words.\n\n      ""PSSST"" -> not a word.\n\n      ""ESSAY"" -> E and A absent.\n\n      ""ASSET"" -> A, E, T absent.\n\n      ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, Y absent.\n\n      ""GASSY"" -> G? But we have G available? But wait, ""GASSY"": G A S S Y -> A and Y absent.\n\n      ""FUSSY"" we already tried.\n\n      ""HUSSY"": H U S S Y -> but Y is absent, and we are putting S in position 2? In ""HUSSY"", the S\'s are in positions 3 and 4. We need S in position 2 and 4.\n\n      How about ""BUSSES"" -> 6 letters.\n\n      ""SASSY"": S A S S Y -> A and Y absent.\n\n      ""LASSY"": L A S S Y -> A and Y absent.\n\n      ""MASSY"": M and Y absent.\n\n      ""PASSY"": P A S S Y -> A and Y absent.\n\n      ""TASSY"": T and Y absent.\n\n      ""WUSSY"": W U S S Y -> but Y is absent.\n\n      ""JUSSI"" -> not a word.\n\n      ""SISSY"": S I S S Y -> I and Y absent.\n\n      ""SUSES"": S U S E S -> E absent.\n\n      ""SUSUS"" -> not a word.\n\n      ""SUSPS"" -> not a word.\n\n   This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that the secret word might have more than two S\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we might have the U in position 1 or 5 and the second S in position 1 or 5.\n\n   Let me try to list words that have S in position 4 and at least one more S, and U somewhere (not position 2), and avoid absent letters.\n\n   We can use a word list? But we don\'t have one, so we have to think.\n\n   Another idea: the word ""SUDDS"": \n        S U D D S -> \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: U -> but U cannot be in position 2? Because in guess 3, U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning U is not in position 2. So this is invalid.\n\n   How about ""SUDDS"" has U in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n   ""SUSUD"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""USURE"" -> E absent.\n\n   ""USURP"" -> R absent.\n\n   ""USUAL"" -> A absent.\n\n   ""USUFS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""USULU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""USQUE"" -> E absent.\n\n   ""USNEA"" -> E and A absent.\n\n   ""USARA"" -> A absent.\n\n   ""USAGE"" -> A and E absent.\n\n   ""USHER"" -> E and R absent.\n\n   ""USNIC"" -> C absent.\n\n   ""USENT"" -> E and N and T absent.\n\n   I\'m struggling. Let\'s try a different approach: put U in position 1 and the second S in position 5.\n\n   Pattern: U _ _ S S\n\n   Then we need to fill position 2 and 3 with available letters (B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and possibly S? But we already have two S\'s (position 4 and 5), so we don\'t need more.\n\n   Example: ""U B D S S"" -> ""UBDSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U G G S S"" -> ""UGGSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U P P S S"" -> ""UPPSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U L L S S"" -> ""ULLSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U S L S S"" -> ""USLSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 1 and S in position 2? But position 2 is not allowed for U? No, U is in position 1, which is allowed. But we are also putting S in position 2? That would be the second S? But we have S in position 4 and 5 and also 2? That\'s three S\'s. And the word would be ""USLSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   How about ""U S _ S _"" but then we have S in position 2, which is not allowed for U? But U is in 1. However, we are trying to avoid S in position 2? We don\'t know if it\'s allowed or not. We only know that U is not in position 2, but S can be in position 2.\n\n   But in this pattern, if we put S in position 2, then the word is ""U S ? S ?"", and we need to fill the third and fifth.\n\n   Example: ""U S B S S"" -> ""USBSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U S P S S"" -> ""USPSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U S W S S"" -> ""USWSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""U S G S S"" -> ""USGSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   This is not working.\n\n   What if we put the second S in position 1 and U in position 5?\n      Pattern: S _ _ S U\n\n   Then fill position 2 and 3 with available letters.\n\n   Example: ""S B D S U"" -> ""SBDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S H D S U"" -> ""SHDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S K D S U"" -> ""SKDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S P D S U"" -> ""SPDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S L D S U"" -> ""SLDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S V D S U"" -> ""SVDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S W D S U"" -> ""SWDSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S G G S U"" -> ""SGGSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S P L S U"" -> ""SPLSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S K L S U"" -> ""SKLSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S H L S U"" -> ""SHLSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S V L S U"" -> ""SVLSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S W L S U"" -> ""SWLSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S P P S U"" -> ""SPPSU"" -> not a word.\n\n   I am considering that the secret word might have U in position 3 and the second S in position 5.\n\n   Pattern: _ _ U S S\n\n   Then position 1 and 2 are to be filled.\n\n   Example: ""B L U S S"" -> ""BLUSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""B U U S S"" -> ""BUUSS"" -> not a word. Also, U in position 2 is not allowed? We can have U in position 2? But the feedback said U is not in position 2, but it can be in other positions. However, this has U in position 2 and 3? But the feedback only said U is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn\'t say anything about position 3. So U can be in position 3.\n\n   But in ""BUUSS"", we have U in position 2 and 3. Position 2 is not allowed for U? The feedback from guess 3: U was in position 2 and got dash, meaning that there is a U in the word, but not in position 2. So if the secret word has U in position 2, that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the secret word does not have U in position 2. So we cannot have U in position 2 in our guess either? No, we can, but it would be marked as absent or dash? \n\n   But in our guess, if we put U in position 2, and the secret word has U but not in position 2, then we would get a dash for that U? Or if the secret word has only one U and it\'s in position 3, then the U in position 2 would be marked as dash? But that would be inconsistent with the secret word not having U in position 2. \n\n   Actually, the feedback for a letter in the guess is independent. If we guess U in position 2, and the secret word has U in position 3, then we would get a dash for position 2.\n\n   But in this case, we know the secret word has U, but not in position 2. So if we guess U in position 2, we will get a dash (because U is in the word but not in position 2). \n\n   However, we already know that, so it doesn\'t give us new information. We want to test new positions.\n\n   So back to pattern _ _ U S S:\n\n   We can try:\n     ""B G U S S"" -> ""BGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""D G U S S"" -> ""DGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""G G U S S"" -> ""GGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""H G U S S"" -> ""HGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""J G U S S"" -> ""JGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""K G U S S"" -> ""KGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""L G U S S"" -> ""LGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""P G U S S"" -> ""PGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""V G U S S"" -> ""VGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""W G U S S"" -> ""WGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""X G U S S"" -> ""XGUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""Z G U S S"" -> ""ZGUSS"" -> not a word.\n\n   Or with different letter in position 1:\n\n     ""G B U S S"" -> ""GBUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""G D U S S"" -> ""GDUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""G H U S S"" -> ""GHUSS"" -> not a word.\n     ""GHUSS"" might be ""ghus"" (a type of wild sheep)? But it\'s not a standard word. Typically, it\'s ""ghus"" is not a 5-letter word.\n\n   How about "" issue"" but I and E absent.\n\n   I am considering the word ""truss"" -> T and R absent.\n\n   ""bless"" -> E absent.\n\n   ""dress"" -> E and R absent.\n\n   ""guess"" -> E absent.\n\n   ""jess"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n   ""kiss"" -> not 5.\n\n   ""loss"" -> not 5.\n\n   ""mess"" -> not 5.\n\n   ""press"" -> P R E -> R and E absent.\n\n   ""tress"" -> T, R, E absent.\n\n   ""buss"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n   ""cuss"" -> C absent.\n\n   ""fuss"" -> F absent.\n\n   ""muss"" -> M absent.\n\n   ""puss"" -> ""puss"" is 4 letters.\n\n   ""wuss"" -> ""wuss"" is 4 letters.\n\n   ""luser"" -> E and R absent.\n\n   I am considering that the second S might be in position 1, and U in position 3.\n\n   Pattern: S _ U S _\n\n   Example: ""S B U S K"" -> ""SBUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S D U S K"" -> ""SDUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S G U S K"" -> ""SGUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S H U S K"" -> ""SHUSK"" -> valid word! ""husk"" is a word, but ""SHUSK"" is not. ""HUSK"" is 4 letters.\n\n   ""S K U S K"" -> ""SKUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S L U S K"" -> ""SLUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S P U S K"" -> ""SPUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S V U S K"" -> ""SVUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S W U S K"" -> ""SWUSK"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S B U S H"" -> ""SBUSH"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""S H U S H"" -> ""SHUSH"" -> valid word! ""SHUSH""\n\n   Let\'s check ""SHUSH"":\n     - S in position 1, H in 2, U in 3, S in 4, H in 5.\n     - We know the secret word has S in position 4 -> matches.\n     - It has two S\'s: positions 1 and 4.\n     - It has U in position 3 -> which is allowed (U not in position 2).\n     - Letters: S, H, U, S, H.\n     - Check absent letters: H is not in the absent list, so it\'s available.\n     - The word ""shush"" is a valid English word (meaning: to urge to be quiet).\n\n   Now, does it meet all?\n     - Position 4 is S -> correct.\n     - It has at least two S\'s: yes.\n     - U is in the word, not in position 2: it\'s in position 3.\n     - Avoids absent letters: S, H, U are not absent.\n\n   But note: we have H in position 2 and 5. We don\'t know if H is in the word or not. We haven\'t tested H before.\n\n   Also, the feedback from guess 3: we had F, U, S, S, Y. We know U is present, S is present, F and Y are absent. We don\'t have information on H.\n\n   So ""SHUSH"" seems to be a valid guess.\n\n   Let\'s see if there are other possibilities.\n\n   Another word: ""SLUSH"" -> but L is available, and U in position 3. ""SLUSH"": S L U S H -> \n        Position 1: S\n        Position 2: L\n        Position 3: U\n        Position 4: S\n        Position 5: H\n        This also has two S\'s and U in position 3.\n\n   ""SLUSH"" is a word (meaning: partially melted snow).\n\n   So we have at least two candidates: ""SHUSH"" and ""SLUSH"".\n\n   We need to choose one that maximizes information. We want to test new letters.\n\n   In ""SHUSH"", we are using H twice. We haven\'t tested H before, so we are testing H.\n\n   In ""SLUSH"", we are testing L and H.\n\n   Since we have more letters to test, ""SLUSH"" tests two new letters (L and H) while ""SHUSH"" tests only H (but twice).\n\n   So ""SLUSH"" might be better.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid absent letters. Both are valid.\n\n   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have H or not. We don\'t know.\n\n   Given that we have limited guesses, let\'s go with ""SLUSH"".\n\n   But wait, in ""SLUSH"", the second S is in position 1 and 4. We know position 4 is S, and position 1 is being tested. The feedback for position 1 will tell us if there is an S in position 1 or not.\n\n   Similarly, we test L in position 2 and H in position 5.\n\n   So I think ""SLUSH"" is a good guess.\n\n   Let\'s output that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  \n2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4.

We have the feedback for the fourth guess: ""slush"" -> S(-), L(✓), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓)

Interpretation:
- S in position 1: dash (-) -> this S is present in the word but not in position 1.
- L in position 2: check (✓) -> L is correct and in position 2.
- U in position 3: check (✓) -> U is correct and in position 3.
- S in position 4: check (✓) -> we already knew S is in position 4.
- H in position 5: check (✓) -> H is correct and in position 5.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: H

And it has an additional S that is not in position 1 (because of the dash for position 1). Since positions 2,3,4,5 are already fixed (L, U, S, H), the only position left is position 1. But the feedback says the S in position 1 is not in the word at position 1, but it is present elsewhere. However, the only other positions are 2,3,4,5 and they are fixed to L, U, S, H. Position 4 is S, so that accounts for one S. The dash for position 1 means there is another S in the word? But we have only five positions.

Wait, this implies that the secret word has at least two S's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the other positions are fixed: 2 is L, 3 is U, 5 is H. So the only possibility is that the secret word has S in position 1? But the feedback says the S in position 1 is not in position 1? That's a contradiction.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word has:
  Position 2: L (from L(✓))
  Position 3: U (from U(✓))
  Position 4: S (from S(✓))
  Position 5: H (from H(✓))

So the word is: ? L U S H

Now, the first letter (position 1) is unknown.

In our guess ""slush"", we put S in position 1. The feedback for that S was dash (-), meaning that S is in the word but not in position 1. But we already have an S in position 4. So the dash for position 1 indicates that there is an additional S in the word? But the secret word only has 5 letters. If position 1 is not S, and positions 2,3,4,5 are L,U,S,H, then the secret word has only one S (at position 4). But then the S in position 1 of the guess should be marked as absent (x) because there is no other S besides the one in position 4? But it was marked as dash (-), which means there is an S in the secret word that is not in position 1. Since position 4 is already S, that S is accounted for by the correct position 4. So why is the S in position 1 marked as dash?

This suggests that the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the other positions are 1,2,3,5. We know position 2 is L, position 3 is U, position 5 is H. So the only possibility is that position 1 is also S? But then the feedback for position 1 should be a check (✓) if it is S, not a dash. But it's a dash.

Alternatively, the feedback system might be that the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 1, and it doesn't necessarily mean an additional S. But in this case, the S in position 4 is already matched. The S in position 1 of the guess is not matching the secret's position 1 (which is not S) and there is no other S to match it? So it should be x.

But it was given as dash. This is confusing.

Let me recall the rules: 
  - A dash (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
  - A check (✓) means the letter is in the correct position.
  - An x means the letter is not in the word.

In the guess ""slush"", we have two S's. The secret word is ? L U S H.

Case 1: If the secret word has exactly one S (at position 4), then:
  - The S in position 4 of the guess is correct -> ✓.
  - The S in position 1 of the guess: since there is no other S in the secret, it should be marked as x.

But the feedback was S(-) for position 1, which is dash, not x.

Case 2: If the secret word has two S's, then one is at position 4 and the other must be at position 1? But then the S in position 1 should be ✓, but we got dash.

This is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1 and not 4? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know 2 is L, 3 is U, 4 is S, 5 is H. So position 1 must be the only one left. If position 1 is S, then we have two S's: position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, but we got dash.

Alternatively, the secret word might have an S in position 1 and also in position 4? Then the guess has S in position 1 and 4. The secret has S in position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓ and for position 4 ✓. But we got dash for position 1 and ✓ for position 4. That doesn't match.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of how duplicate letters are handled.

Standard Wordle rules for duplicate letters:
  - If the secret word has one S, and you guess two S's, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x.
  - If the secret word has two S's, and you guess two S's, then:
        - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
        - The other might get - if it is in a position where the secret has an unmatched S.

In this case, for ""slush"" (guess) and secret ""? L U S H"":

  - If the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then:
        Position 1: S -> should be x (because there's no extra S)
        Position 4: S -> ✓

  - But we got position 1: - (dash), which would require that there is an extra S in the secret word that is not in position 1.

  - So the secret word must have two S's: one at position 4 and one at position ?. The only position available is position 1? But then position 1 should be S, and then the guess has S at position 1, so it should be ✓, not dash.

This is a paradox.

The only resolution is that the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? But that's impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for duplicate letters is that the first occurrence of a letter in the guess that matches a letter in the secret gets the feedback, and extras are marked x. But that doesn't seem to be the case because in guess 3 we had two S's and one was dash and one was check.

Another possibility: the secret word is ""SLUSH"" itself? But then the feedback would be:
  Position 1: S -> ✓ (because secret has S at 1)
  Position 2: L -> ✓
  Position 3: U -> ✓
  Position 4: S -> ✓
  Position 5: H -> ✓

But we got S(-) for position 1, which is not ✓.

So the secret word is not ""SLUSH"".

Let me re-read the feedback for guess 4: ""S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)""

This means:
  - The first letter S is not in the correct position but is in the word (so there is an S elsewhere).
  - The second letter L is correct.
  - The third letter U is correct.
  - The fourth letter S is correct.
  - The fifth letter H is correct.

So the secret word has L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5, and also has an S that is not in position 1.

But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We have fixed 2,3,4,5. So the only position left is 1. But if position 1 is not S, then where is the extra S? It must be in position 1? But then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, not dash.

This suggests that the secret word has three S's? Then:
  - One in position 4 (matched by the fourth S in the guess, so ✓)
  - One in position 1: but then the guess has S in position 1, so it should be ✓, not dash.
  - And one in another position? But positions 2,3,5 are fixed to L,U,H, which are not S.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in position 1, but then the guess has S in position 1 and 4. The secret has S in position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, not dash.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or in our understanding.

Perhaps the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 1, and it is not the S that is in position 4? But that would require a second S in the secret word in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has an S in position 5? But position 5 is H, and we have H(✓), so position 5 is H, not S.

Similarly, position 2 is L, position 3 is U, position 4 is S, position 5 is H.

So the only possibility is that the secret word has an extra S in position 1, but then the guess has S in position 1, so it should be correct.

Given the feedback, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has the letter S in a position that is not 1, and since positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed to L,U,S,H, the only way is if there is a duplicate in one of these positions? For example, if the secret word has two S's in position 4? But that's not possible because it's the same position.

Or if the secret word is ""SLUSH"" but with an extra S somewhere? But it's 5 letters.

I think there is a flaw in our earlier deduction.

Let me double-check the feedback for guess 4: ""S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)""

This means:
  - The first letter of the guess (S) is not in the correct position but is in the word elsewhere.
  - The second letter (L) is correct.
  - The third letter (U) is correct.
  - The fourth letter (S) is correct.
  - The fifth letter (H) is correct.

So the secret word must contain an S that is not in position 1. But it also must have L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has at least two S's: one in position 4 and one in a different position. The different position cannot be 1 (because then the guess would have it and it would be ✓ if it's in 1, but it's not), and cannot be 2,3,5 because they are fixed to L,U,H. This is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three S's: one in position 4, one in position 1 (but then the guess has S in 1 and it should be ✓), and one in another position? But no other position.

I think the only possibility is that the secret word is not 5 letters? But it is.

Perhaps the feedback for the first S is dash because there is an S in the secret word in a position that is not 1, and that S is not the one in position 4? But that would require two S's in the secret: one in position 4 and one in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

I recall that in some Wordle implementations, for duplicate letters, the feedback might not count the same instance twice. For example, if the secret has one S, and you guess two S's, the first S (in position 1) might be marked as dash (if there is an S in the secret not in position 1) and the second S (in position 4) might be marked as dash or x? But in this case, the secret has S in position 4, so the second S in the guess (position 4) is correctly placed, so it should be ✓, and the first S (position 1) should be x because there's only one S.

But we got dash for the first S.

This suggests that the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in a position that is not 1 and not 4. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know 2,3,5 are L,U,H. So the only possibility is that the secret word has S in position 1 and position 4. But then the guess has S in position 1 and 4, so position 1 should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps the secret word is ""LUSHS"" or something, but then position 2 would be U, not L.

Let's list what we know for sure from feedback:
- Position 2: L (from guess 4: L(✓))
- Position 3: U (from guess 4: U(✓))
- Position 4: S (from guess 2: S(✓) and guess 4: S(✓))
- Position 5: H (from guess 4: H(✓))

So the secret word is: ? L U S H

The first position is unknown.

From guess 4, the first letter S is not in position 1 but is in the word. Since the only other S we know is in position 4, and it's already matched, this implies that the secret word must have another S somewhere. The only place is position 1. So the secret word must be ""SLUSH"", but then the first letter S should be correct, but the feedback says dash for position 1.

This is a contradiction.

Unless the feedback is given per letter without considering the multiplicity in the secret? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the secret word that is not in position 1, and it is not necessarily an additional S. But in this case, the S in position 4 is that S. So the first S in the guess (position 1) is not in the secret in position 1, but there is an S in position 4, so it is in the word, hence dash.

But then the secret word has only one S, at position 4. Then the first S in the guess should not be marked as dash because dash means ""present but wrong position"", but if there's only one S and it's already matched by the fourth S in the guess, then the first S should be marked as absent (x).

This is the core of the issue.

In standard Wordle, if the secret has one S, and you guess a word with two S's, and one of them is in the correct position (position 4), then the correct one gets ✓, and the other S (position 1) gets x, because there's only one S in the secret and it's already used.

But in this feedback, the first S got dash, which means the algorithm is not that.

Perhaps the algorithm is that it doesn't reuse letters. But that doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1 and not 4, but we know positions 2,3,5 are L,U,H, so they can't be S.

I think there might be a mistake in the initial setup or in the feedback.

Given the time, perhaps we should assume that the secret word is ""SLUSH"" and the feedback for position 1 is a mistake, or we should guess ""SLUSH"" for the next guess.

But we have only two guesses left.

Perhaps the secret word is ""BLUSH"", but then position 4 is S, but ""BLUSH"" has S in position 4? B L U S H. Then in guess 4 ""slush"", we have:
  Position 1: S (guess) vs B (secret) -> S is not in the secret? But secret has no S except position 4, which is matched by position 4 of guess. So S in position 1 should be x. But we got dash.

And for ""BLUSH"", there is only one S, so it should be x for position 1.

But we got dash, so it can't be ""BLUSH"".

Similarly, ""FLUSH"": F is absent, and also only one S.

""PLUSH"": P is available, and only one S. Then position 1: S in guess vs P in secret -> S is not in the secret, so x. But we got dash.

So it must have two S's.

The only 5-letter word that has L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5, and another S somewhere is if position 1 is S, i.e., ""SLUSH"".

So I think the feedback might have a typo, or we should guess ""SLUSH"" as the next guess.

But we already guessed ""SLUSH"" and it's not the secret, according to the feedback.

Perhaps the secret is ""SLUSh"" with lowercase, but that's the same.

Another idea: the secret word might have the letters but we have to consider that the dash for position 1 means that there is an S in the secret in a position that is not 1, and it is not position 4 because that's already matched? But then it must be in position 2,3, or 5, but they are L,U,H.

Unless one of them is S? But the feedback says L is correct, so position 2 is L, not S. Similarly, position 3 is U, position 5 is H.

So no.

Perhaps the feedback for position 1 is for the letter S, but in the secret, there is a letter that is not S in position 1, but there is an S in the word (at position 4), so it is marked as dash. But then the guess has S in position 1, and the secret has non-S in position 1 and S in position 4, so the S in position 1 should be marked as dash because it is in the word (at position 4) but not in position 1.

This is the key: in this interpretation, even if there is only one S in the secret, if it is not in the position guessed, it gets a dash. But in this case, for guess ""slush"":
  - Position 1: S -> the secret has an S, but not in position 1 ( it is in position 4), so dash.
  - Position 4: S -> correct position, so ✓.

This is consistent with the secret word having only one S.

For example, the secret word is ""BLUSH"" (B L U S H). Then:
  - Position 1: S (guess) vs B (secret) -> S is in the word (at position 4) but not in position 1, so dash.
  - Position 2: L vs L -> ✓
  - Position 3: U vs U -> ✓
  - Position 4: S vs S -> ✓
  - Position 5: H vs H -> ✓

So the feedback would be: S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

This is exactly what we have.

Therefore, the secret word is ""BLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" etc., but we know F is absent from guess 3, so not ""FLUSH"". Also, from guess 1, R, A, N, E are absent, and from guess 2, M, O, I, T are absent, and from guess 3, F and Y are absent.

So the first letter must be from the available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And the secret word is ? L U S H, and it must be a valid English word.

Common words: BLUSH, PLUSH, SLUSH (but we already guessed SLUSH and it's not, because if it were, the first letter would be S and we got dash, so it's not S).

Other possibilities:
  - ""BLUSH"": B is available.
  - ""PLUSH"": P is available.
  - ""ULUSH"" -> not a word.
  - ""aLUSH"" -> not.
  - ""WLUSH"" -> not.
  - ""KLUSH"" -> not.
  - etc.

So likely ""BLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"".

We have not tested B or P yet.

So for the next guess, we can guess ""BLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"".

Since we have two guesses left, we can try one.

Let's try ""BLUSH"".

But note: if we guess ""BLUSH"", and the secret is ""BLUSH"", then we win.

If not, then it must be ""PLUSH"".

So we can guess ""BLUSH"".

Alternatively, to be safe, we could guess a word that tests the first letter, but we have to have S in position 4, etc., but we know the last four letters are LUSH.

So we can guess ""BLUSH"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  
2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T absent.  
3. **Guess 3: FUSSY** →  
   - **F(x)**: F absent.  
   - **U(-)**: U present but not in position 2.  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 3 (indicating at least one additional S besides position 4).  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - **Y(x)**: Y absent.  
4. **Guess 4: SLUSH** →  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 1.  
   - **L(✓)**: L correct in position 2.  
   - **U(✓)**: U correct in position 3.  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4.  
   - **H(✓)**: H correct in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  - **Position 2**: L (fixed).  
  - **Position 3**: U (fixed).  
  - **Position 4**: S (fixed).  
  - **Position 5**: H (fixed).  
  - **Position 1**: Unknown letter (must be a letter not yet eliminated).  
- **S in position 1 is not correct** (feedback: S(-)), but S is present elsewhere (position 4).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.  
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Given the fixed ""LUSH"" in positions 2-5, valid options are:  
  - **BLUSH** (meaning: to become red in the face).  
  - **PLUSH** (meaning: made of thick soft fabric).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **BLUSH** is selected because:  
  - It tests the high-frequency consonant **B** for position 1.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved. If incorrect, **PLUSH** is the only remaining option.  
- **Why not PLUSH?** Guessing **BLUSH** first maximizes efficiency (solves if B is correct, or confirms P if not).

<guess>blush</guess>",blush,"We have the feedback for the fourth guess: ""slush"" -> S(-), L(✓), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓)

Interpretation:
- S in position 1: dash (-) -> this S is present in the word but not in position 1.
- L in position 2: check (✓) -> L is correct and in position 2.
- U in position 3: check (✓) -> U is correct and in position 3.
- S in position 4: check (✓) -> we already knew S is in position 4.
- H in position 5: check (✓) -> H is correct and in position 5.

So the secret word has:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: H

And it has an additional S that is not in position 1 (because of the dash for position 1). Since positions 2,3,4,5 are already fixed (L, U, S, H), the only position left is position 1. But the feedback says the S in position 1 is not in the word at position 1, but it is present elsewhere. However, the only other positions are 2,3,4,5 and they are fixed to L, U, S, H. Position 4 is S, so that accounts for one S. The dash for position 1 means there is another S in the word? But we have only five positions.

Wait, this implies that the secret word has at least two S's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the other positions are fixed: 2 is L, 3 is U, 5 is H. So the only possibility is that the secret word has S in position 1? But the feedback says the S in position 1 is not in position 1? That's a contradiction.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word has:
  Position 2: L (from L(✓))
  Position 3: U (from U(✓))
  Position 4: S (from S(✓))
  Position 5: H (from H(✓))

So the word is: ? L U S H

Now, the first letter (position 1) is unknown.

In our guess ""slush"", we put S in position 1. The feedback for that S was dash (-), meaning that S is in the word but not in position 1. But we already have an S in position 4. So the dash for position 1 indicates that there is an additional S in the word? But the secret word only has 5 letters. If position 1 is not S, and positions 2,3,4,5 are L,U,S,H, then the secret word has only one S (at position 4). But then the S in position 1 of the guess should be marked as absent (x) because there is no other S besides the one in position 4? But it was marked as dash (-), which means there is an S in the secret word that is not in position 1. Since position 4 is already S, that S is accounted for by the correct position 4. So why is the S in position 1 marked as dash?

This suggests that the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the other positions are 1,2,3,5. We know position 2 is L, position 3 is U, position 5 is H. So the only possibility is that position 1 is also S? But then the feedback for position 1 should be a check (✓) if it is S, not a dash. But it's a dash.

Alternatively, the feedback system might be that the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 1, and it doesn't necessarily mean an additional S. But in this case, the S in position 4 is already matched. The S in position 1 of the guess is not matching the secret's position 1 (which is not S) and there is no other S to match it? So it should be x.

But it was given as dash. This is confusing.

Let me recall the rules: 
  - A dash (-) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
  - A check (✓) means the letter is in the correct position.
  - An x means the letter is not in the word.

In the guess ""slush"", we have two S's. The secret word is ? L U S H.

Case 1: If the secret word has exactly one S (at position 4), then:
  - The S in position 4 of the guess is correct -> ✓.
  - The S in position 1 of the guess: since there is no other S in the secret, it should be marked as x.

But the feedback was S(-) for position 1, which is dash, not x.

Case 2: If the secret word has two S's, then one is at position 4 and the other must be at position 1? But then the S in position 1 should be ✓, but we got dash.

This is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1 and not 4? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know 2 is L, 3 is U, 4 is S, 5 is H. So position 1 must be the only one left. If position 1 is S, then we have two S's: position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, but we got dash.

Alternatively, the secret word might have an S in position 1 and also in position 4? Then the guess has S in position 1 and 4. The secret has S in position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓ and for position 4 ✓. But we got dash for position 1 and ✓ for position 4. That doesn't match.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of how duplicate letters are handled.

Standard Wordle rules for duplicate letters:
  - If the secret word has one S, and you guess two S's, then one of them (if in the correct position) gets ✓, and the other gets x.
  - If the secret word has two S's, and you guess two S's, then:
        - If one is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
        - The other might get - if it is in a position where the secret has an unmatched S.

In this case, for ""slush"" (guess) and secret ""? L U S H"":

  - If the secret word has only one S (at position 4), then:
        Position 1: S -> should be x (because there's no extra S)
        Position 4: S -> ✓

  - But we got position 1: - (dash), which would require that there is an extra S in the secret word that is not in position 1.

  - So the secret word must have two S's: one at position 4 and one at position ?. The only position available is position 1? But then position 1 should be S, and then the guess has S at position 1, so it should be ✓, not dash.

This is a paradox.

The only resolution is that the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? But that's impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for duplicate letters is that the first occurrence of a letter in the guess that matches a letter in the secret gets the feedback, and extras are marked x. But that doesn't seem to be the case because in guess 3 we had two S's and one was dash and one was check.

Another possibility: the secret word is ""SLUSH"" itself? But then the feedback would be:
  Position 1: S -> ✓ (because secret has S at 1)
  Position 2: L -> ✓
  Position 3: U -> ✓
  Position 4: S -> ✓
  Position 5: H -> ✓

But we got S(-) for position 1, which is not ✓.

So the secret word is not ""SLUSH"".

Let me re-read the feedback for guess 4: ""S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)""

This means:
  - The first letter S is not in the correct position but is in the word (so there is an S elsewhere).
  - The second letter L is correct.
  - The third letter U is correct.
  - The fourth letter S is correct.
  - The fifth letter H is correct.

So the secret word has L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5, and also has an S that is not in position 1.

But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We have fixed 2,3,4,5. So the only position left is 1. But if position 1 is not S, then where is the extra S? It must be in position 1? But then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, not dash.

This suggests that the secret word has three S's? Then:
  - One in position 4 (matched by the fourth S in the guess, so ✓)
  - One in position 1: but then the guess has S in position 1, so it should be ✓, not dash.
  - And one in another position? But positions 2,3,5 are fixed to L,U,H, which are not S.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in position 1, but then the guess has S in position 1 and 4. The secret has S in position 1 and 4. Then the feedback for position 1 should be ✓, not dash.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or in our understanding.

Perhaps the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the word that is not in position 1, and it is not the S that is in position 4? But that would require a second S in the secret word in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has an S in position 5? But position 5 is H, and we have H(✓), so position 5 is H, not S.

Similarly, position 2 is L, position 3 is U, position 4 is S, position 5 is H.

So the only possibility is that the secret word has an extra S in position 1, but then the guess has S in position 1, so it should be correct.

Given the feedback, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has the letter S in a position that is not 1, and since positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed to L,U,S,H, the only way is if there is a duplicate in one of these positions? For example, if the secret word has two S's in position 4? But that's not possible because it's the same position.

Or if the secret word is ""SLUSH"" but with an extra S somewhere? But it's 5 letters.

I think there is a flaw in our earlier deduction.

Let me double-check the feedback for guess 4: ""S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)""

This means:
  - The first letter of the guess (S) is not in the correct position but is in the word elsewhere.
  - The second letter (L) is correct.
  - The third letter (U) is correct.
  - The fourth letter (S) is correct.
  - The fifth letter (H) is correct.

So the secret word must contain an S that is not in position 1. But it also must have L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has at least two S's: one in position 4 and one in a different position. The different position cannot be 1 (because then the guess would have it and it would be ✓ if it's in 1, but it's not), and cannot be 2,3,5 because they are fixed to L,U,H. This is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three S's: one in position 4, one in position 1 (but then the guess has S in 1 and it should be ✓), and one in another position? But no other position.

I think the only possibility is that the secret word is not 5 letters? But it is.

Perhaps the feedback for the first S is dash because there is an S in the secret word in a position that is not 1, and that S is not the one in position 4? But that would require two S's in the secret: one in position 4 and one in a position that is not 1,2,3,4,5? Impossible.

I recall that in some Wordle implementations, for duplicate letters, the feedback might not count the same instance twice. For example, if the secret has one S, and you guess two S's, the first S (in position 1) might be marked as dash (if there is an S in the secret not in position 1) and the second S (in position 4) might be marked as dash or x? But in this case, the secret has S in position 4, so the second S in the guess (position 4) is correctly placed, so it should be ✓, and the first S (position 1) should be x because there's only one S.

But we got dash for the first S.

This suggests that the secret word has two S's: one in position 4 and one in a position that is not 1 and not 4. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know 2,3,5 are L,U,H. So the only possibility is that the secret word has S in position 1 and position 4. But then the guess has S in position 1 and 4, so position 1 should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps the secret word is ""LUSHS"" or something, but then position 2 would be U, not L.

Let's list what we know for sure from feedback:
- Position 2: L (from guess 4: L(✓))
- Position 3: U (from guess 4: U(✓))
- Position 4: S (from guess 2: S(✓) and guess 4: S(✓))
- Position 5: H (from guess 4: H(✓))

So the secret word is: ? L U S H

The first position is unknown.

From guess 4, the first letter S is not in position 1 but is in the word. Since the only other S we know is in position 4, and it's already matched, this implies that the secret word must have another S somewhere. The only place is position 1. So the secret word must be ""SLUSH"", but then the first letter S should be correct, but the feedback says dash for position 1.

This is a contradiction.

Unless the feedback is given per letter without considering the multiplicity in the secret? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps the dash for the first S means that there is an S in the secret word that is not in position 1, and it is not necessarily an additional S. But in this case, the S in position 4 is that S. So the first S in the guess (position 1) is not in the secret in position 1, but there is an S in position 4, so it is in the word, hence dash.

But then the secret word has only one S, at position 4. Then the first S in the guess should not be marked as dash because dash means ""present but wrong position"", but if there's only one S and it's already matched by the fourth S in the guess, then the first S should be marked as absent (x).

This is the core of the issue.

In standard Wordle, if the secret has one S, and you guess a word with two S's, and one of them is in the correct position (position 4), then the correct one gets ✓, and the other S (position 1) gets x, because there's only one S in the secret and it's already used.

But in this feedback, the first S got dash, which means the algorithm is not that.

Perhaps the algorithm is that it doesn't reuse letters. But that doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the secret word has an S in a position that is not 1 and not 4, but we know positions 2,3,5 are L,U,H, so they can't be S.

I think there might be a mistake in the initial setup or in the feedback.

Given the time, perhaps we should assume that the secret word is ""SLUSH"" and the feedback for position 1 is a mistake, or we should guess ""SLUSH"" for the next guess.

But we have only two guesses left.

Perhaps the secret word is ""BLUSH"", but then position 4 is S, but ""BLUSH"" has S in position 4? B L U S H. Then in guess 4 ""slush"", we have:
  Position 1: S (guess) vs B (secret) -> S is not in the secret? But secret has no S except position 4, which is matched by position 4 of guess. So S in position 1 should be x. But we got dash.

And for ""BLUSH"", there is only one S, so it should be x for position 1.

But we got dash, so it can't be ""BLUSH"".

Similarly, ""FLUSH"": F is absent, and also only one S.

""PLUSH"": P is available, and only one S. Then position 1: S in guess vs P in secret -> S is not in the secret, so x. But we got dash.

So it must have two S's.

The only 5-letter word that has L in position 2, U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5, and another S somewhere is if position 1 is S, i.e., ""SLUSH"".

So I think the feedback might have a typo, or we should guess ""SLUSH"" as the next guess.

But we already guessed ""SLUSH"" and it's not the secret, according to the feedback.

Perhaps the secret is ""SLUSh"" with lowercase, but that's the same.

Another idea: the secret word might have the letters but we have to consider that the dash for position 1 means that there is an S in the secret in a position that is not 1, and it is not position 4 because that's already matched? But then it must be in position 2,3, or 5, but they are L,U,H.

Unless one of them is S? But the feedback says L is correct, so position 2 is L, not S. Similarly, position 3 is U, position 5 is H.

So no.

Perhaps the feedback for position 1 is for the letter S, but in the secret, there is a letter that is not S in position 1, but there is an S in the word (at position 4), so it is marked as dash. But then the guess has S in position 1, and the secret has non-S in position 1 and S in position 4, so the S in position 1 should be marked as dash because it is in the word (at position 4) but not in position 1.

This is the key: in this interpretation, even if there is only one S in the secret, if it is not in the position guessed, it gets a dash. But in this case, for guess ""slush"":
  - Position 1: S -> the secret has an S, but not in position 1 ( it is in position 4), so dash.
  - Position 4: S -> correct position, so ✓.

This is consistent with the secret word having only one S.

For example, the secret word is ""BLUSH"" (B L U S H). Then:
  - Position 1: S (guess) vs B (secret) -> S is in the word (at position 4) but not in position 1, so dash.
  - Position 2: L vs L -> ✓
  - Position 3: U vs U -> ✓
  - Position 4: S vs S -> ✓
  - Position 5: H vs H -> ✓

So the feedback would be: S(-) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓)

This is exactly what we have.

Therefore, the secret word is ""BLUSH"" or ""FLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"" etc., but we know F is absent from guess 3, so not ""FLUSH"". Also, from guess 1, R, A, N, E are absent, and from guess 2, M, O, I, T are absent, and from guess 3, F and Y are absent.

So the first letter must be from the available letters: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And the secret word is ? L U S H, and it must be a valid English word.

Common words: BLUSH, PLUSH, SLUSH (but we already guessed SLUSH and it's not, because if it were, the first letter would be S and we got dash, so it's not S).

Other possibilities:
  - ""BLUSH"": B is available.
  - ""PLUSH"": P is available.
  - ""ULUSH"" -> not a word.
  - ""aLUSH"" -> not.
  - ""WLUSH"" -> not.
  - ""KLUSH"" -> not.
  - etc.

So likely ""BLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"".

We have not tested B or P yet.

So for the next guess, we can guess ""BLUSH"" or ""PLUSH"".

Since we have two guesses left, we can try one.

Let's try ""BLUSH"".

But note: if we guess ""BLUSH"", and the secret is ""BLUSH"", then we win.

If not, then it must be ""PLUSH"".

So we can guess ""BLUSH"".

Alternatively, to be safe, we could guess a word that tests the first letter, but we have to have S in position 4, etc., but we know the last four letters are LUSH.

So we can guess ""BLUSH"".

<guess>blush</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: CRANE** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent.  
2. **Guess 2: MOIST** → **S** is correct and in position 4. Letters M, O, I, T absent.  
3. **Guess 3: FUSSY** →  
   - **F(x)**: F absent.  
   - **U(-)**: U present but not in position 2.  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 3 (indicating at least one additional S besides position 4).  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4 (confirmed).  
   - **Y(x)**: Y absent.  
4. **Guess 4: SLUSH** →  
   - **S(-)**: S present but not in position 1.  
   - **L(✓)**: L correct in position 2.  
   - **U(✓)**: U correct in position 3.  
   - **S(✓)**: S correct in position 4.  
   - **H(✓)**: H correct in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  - **Position 2**: L (fixed).  
  - **Position 3**: U (fixed).  
  - **Position 4**: S (fixed).  
  - **Position 5**: H (fixed).  
  - **Position 1**: Unknown letter (must be a letter not yet eliminated).  
- **S in position 1 is not correct** (feedback: S(-)), but S is present elsewhere (position 4).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, F, Y.  
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, D, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Possible words**: Given the fixed ""LUSH"" in positions 2-5, valid options are:  
  - **BLUSH** (meaning: to become red in the face).  
  - **PLUSH** (meaning: made of thick soft fabric).  

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **BLUSH** is selected because:  
  - It tests the high-frequency consonant **B** for position 1.  
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved. If incorrect, **PLUSH** is the only remaining option.  
- **Why not PLUSH?** Guessing **BLUSH** first maximizes efficiency (solves if B is correct, or confirms P if not).",Guess 5: blush -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
