We are starting the game. There is no feedback yet, so I need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should include common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering these, I choose ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) which are common.
 - It has two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, which gives more information about which letters are present or absent.

 My first guess: RAISE
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically use common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:

- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.
- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.

This initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.

 We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).

 We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.

 Some candidate words that don't use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:

 Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T
 Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.
 Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.
 Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.

 Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 Let's list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.

 Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.

 Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.

 We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).

 However, we don't know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.

 Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:
 - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.
 - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.

 Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.

 Let me compare:
 - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T
 - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H

 Both are valid. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.

 So, the next guess: COUNT

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".
</think>
<thinking>
The feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). 

For the next guess:
- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:
  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.
- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.

This guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.

Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I\'ll choose ""RAISE"" because:\n\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.\n- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.\n\nThis initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as \'x\', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.\n This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.\n\n We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).\n\n We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.\n\n Some candidate words that don\'t use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:\n\n Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T\n Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.\n Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.\n Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.\n\n However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.\n\n Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.\n\n Let\'s list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\n We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.\n\n Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.\n\n Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.\n\n We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).\n\n However, we don\'t know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.\n\n Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.\n\n I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:\n - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.\n - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.\n\n Let me compare:\n - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T\n - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H\n\n Both are valid. We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.\n\n So, the next guess: COUNT\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.\n\n Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".<thinking>\nThe feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). \n\nFor the next guess:\n- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).\n- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.\n- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:\n  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).\n  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.\n  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.\n- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>COUNT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

2. COUNT: 
   - C is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter is C.
   - O is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is O.
   - U is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain U.
   - N is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain N.
   - T is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain T.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CO"" (first two letters are C and O).
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

So the secret word is of the form: C O _ _ _

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels): 
We have used: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, U, N, T. 
So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Y can be a vowel)

But note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.

We must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common patterns for ""CO___"" words:

- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.

Some possibilities:
- COLD: but L and D are available? Let's check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.

We need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don't contain the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

So, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let's check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.
- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.
- COWER: but E and R are excluded.
- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).
- COMBY: not a word.
- COHOG: not common.

Let me list some valid words:

- COLDY? Not a word.
- COMA: only 4 letters.
- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don't have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don't know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another O. However, we don't have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven't done that.

But note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.

Another word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.

Another: COWLY? Not a word.

COBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O's. And B and L are available.

But let's see if we can find more common words.

COVEY: but E is excluded.

COZEY? E is excluded.

COPPY? Not common.

COGNY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not a word.

COVED? But E is excluded.

Maybe words like:

- COULD: but U is excluded.
- COUNT: we already tried, and it had U, N, T which are absent.

Another idea: COMBY? Not a word.

How about COALY? But A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Perhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.

Another: COWPY? Not a word.

Or COYPU? But U is excluded and it's an animal, but U is excluded.

What about COHOG? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.

Words: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.

Letters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.

But we have two Y's. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn't indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it's possible.

But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

Another word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.

COZEN: but E is excluded.

COBLE? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

Perhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.

We are having trouble. Let me think of common words.

Another common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.

COLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.

COLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.

COLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.

COLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.

COMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.

COMPT? Not a word.

CONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.

CONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.

So, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must start with CO.

Let me try to find words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).
- COWLY: not a word.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.
- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.
- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.
- COVED: E excluded.
- COVET: E excluded.
- COWLS: S excluded.
- COYPU: U excluded.
- COZES: E and S excluded.

Another word: COHOG? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

COHOS? S excluded.

COKED? E excluded.

COLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.

COLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.

But we don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it's possible.

But let's see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.

Another word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn't guess O in that position.

But to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.

So, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven't tried.

We know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

So, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.

""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.

Similarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.

So ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.

We can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.

""COWED"" has E.

Another word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.

""COBBS"" has S.

What about ""COBOL""? It's a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let's avoid if possible.

""COHOG"" is not common.

""COYPU"" has U.

Another possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.

""COGON"" - not.

""COKED"" - has E.

""COLED"" - has E.

""COMAE"" - has A and E.

""COMAL"" - A excluded.

""COMBY"" - not a word.

""COMMY"" - not common.

""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.

But we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.

Similarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.

Another word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.

""COWED"" - E.

""COWPS"" - not a word.

""COXED"" - E excluded.

""COYED"" - E.

""COZED"" - E.

So, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.

But ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.

Similarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.

But ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.

So for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.

Moreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.

Therefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".

But note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.

In fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.

So, guess: COMFY

If we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.

So, let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.

For the next guess:
- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.
- I chose **COMFY** because:
  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.
  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).
  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.
  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").

This guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>COMFY</guess>",COMFY,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

2. COUNT: 
   - C is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter is C.
   - O is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is O.
   - U is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain U.
   - N is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain N.
   - T is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain T.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CO"" (first two letters are C and O).
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

So the secret word is of the form: C O _ _ _

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels): 
We have used: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, U, N, T. 
So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Y can be a vowel)

But note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.

We must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common patterns for ""CO___"" words:

- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.

Some possibilities:
- COLD: but L and D are available? Let's check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.

We need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don't contain the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

So, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let's check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.
- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.
- COWER: but E and R are excluded.
- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).
- COMBY: not a word.
- COHOG: not common.

Let me list some valid words:

- COLDY? Not a word.
- COMA: only 4 letters.
- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don't have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don't know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another O. However, we don't have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven't done that.

But note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.

Another word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.

Another: COWLY? Not a word.

COBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O's. And B and L are available.

But let's see if we can find more common words.

But we have two Y's. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn't indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it's possible.

But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

COMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.

So, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must start with CO.

Let me try to find words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).
- COWLY: not a word.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.
- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.

But we don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it's possible.

But let's see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.

Another word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's.

""COWED"" has E.

""COBBS"" has S.

What about ""COBOL""? It's a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let's avoid if possible.

Another possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.

""COGON"" - not.

""COKED"" - has E.

""COLED"" - has E.

""COMAE"" - has A and E.

""COMAL"" - A excluded.

""COMBY"" - not a word.

""COMMY"" - not common.

""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.

But we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.

Similarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.

Another word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.

""COWED"" - E.

""COWPS"" - not a word.

""COXED"" - E excluded.

""COYED"" - E.

""COZED"" - E.

So, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.

But ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.

Similarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.

But ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.

So for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.

Moreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.

Therefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".

But note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.

In fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.

So, guess: COMFY

If we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.

For the next guess:
- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.
- I chose **COMFY** because:
  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.
  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).
  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.
  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").

This guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.",Guess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. There is no feedback yet, so I need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should include common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering these, I choose ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) which are common.
 - It has two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, which gives more information about which letters are present or absent.

 My first guess: RAISE<thinking>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically use common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:

- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.
- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.

This initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.

 We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).

 We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.

 Some candidate words that don't use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:

 Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T
 Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.
 Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.
 Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.

 Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 Let's list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.

 Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.

 Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.

 We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).

 However, we don't know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.

 Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:
 - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.
 - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.

 Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.

 Let me compare:
 - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T
 - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H

 Both are valid. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.

 So, the next guess: COUNT

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".<thinking>
The feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). 

For the next guess:
- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:
  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.
- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.

This guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.
</thinking>

<guess>COUNT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

2. COUNT: 
   - C is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter is C.
   - O is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is O.
   - U is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain U.
   - N is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain N.
   - T is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain T.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CO"" (first two letters are C and O).
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

So the secret word is of the form: C O _ _ _

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels): 
We have used: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, U, N, T. 
So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Y can be a vowel)

But note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.

We must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common patterns for ""CO___"" words:

- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.

Some possibilities:
- COLD: but L and D are available? Let's check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.

We need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don't contain the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

So, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let's check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.
- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.
- COWER: but E and R are excluded.
- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).
- COMBY: not a word.
- COHOG: not common.

Let me list some valid words:

- COLDY? Not a word.
- COMA: only 4 letters.
- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don't have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don't know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another O. However, we don't have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven't done that.

But note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.

Another word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.

Another: COWLY? Not a word.

COBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O's. And B and L are available.

But let's see if we can find more common words.

COVEY: but E is excluded.

COZEY? E is excluded.

COPPY? Not common.

COGNY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not a word.

COVED? But E is excluded.

Maybe words like:

- COULD: but U is excluded.
- COUNT: we already tried, and it had U, N, T which are absent.

Another idea: COMBY? Not a word.

How about COALY? But A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Perhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.

Another: COWPY? Not a word.

Or COYPU? But U is excluded and it's an animal, but U is excluded.

What about COHOG? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.

Words: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.

Letters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.

But we have two Y's. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn't indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it's possible.

But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

Another word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.

COZEN: but E is excluded.

COBLE? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

Perhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.

We are having trouble. Let me think of common words.

Another common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.

COLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.

COLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.

COLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.

COLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.

COMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.

COMPT? Not a word.

CONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.

CONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.

So, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must start with CO.

Let me try to find words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).
- COWLY: not a word.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.
- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.
- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.
- COVED: E excluded.
- COVET: E excluded.
- COWLS: S excluded.
- COYPU: U excluded.
- COZES: E and S excluded.

Another word: COHOG? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

COHOS? S excluded.

COKED? E excluded.

COLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.

COLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.

But we don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it's possible.

But let's see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.

Another word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn't guess O in that position.

But to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.

So, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven't tried.

We know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

So, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.

""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.

Similarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.

So ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.

We can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.

""COWED"" has E.

Another word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.

""COBBS"" has S.

What about ""COBOL""? It's a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let's avoid if possible.

""COHOG"" is not common.

""COYPU"" has U.

Another possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.

""COGON"" - not.

""COKED"" - has E.

""COLED"" - has E.

""COMAE"" - has A and E.

""COMAL"" - A excluded.

""COMBY"" - not a word.

""COMMY"" - not common.

""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.

But we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.

Similarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.

Another word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.

""COWED"" - E.

""COWPS"" - not a word.

""COXED"" - E excluded.

""COYED"" - E.

""COZED"" - E.

So, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.

But ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.

Similarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.

But ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.

So for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.

Moreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.

Therefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".

But note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.

In fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.

So, guess: COMFY

If we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.

For the next guess:
- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.
- I chose **COMFY** because:
  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.
  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).
  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.
  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").

This guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

We must choose a valid English word.\n\n Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.\n\n I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:\n - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.\n - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.\n\n Let me compare:\n - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T\n - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H\n\n Both are valid. We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.\n\n So, the next guess: COUNT\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.\n\n Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".<thinking>\nThe feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). \n\nFor the next guess:\n- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).\n- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.\n- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:\n  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).\n  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.\n  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.\n- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.\n\nThis guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>COUNT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don\'t have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don\'t know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but that doesn\'t prevent the word from having another O. However, we don\'t have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven\'t done that.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.\n\nAnother word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.\n\nAnother: COWLY? Not a word.\n\nCOBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O\'s. And B and L are available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n\nCOVEY: but E is excluded.\n\nCOZEY? E is excluded.\n\nCOPPY? Not common.\n\nCOGNY? Not a word.\n\nCODLY? Not a word.\n\nCOVED?

But A is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nPerhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: COWPY? Not a word.\n\nOr COYPU? But U is excluded and it\'s an animal, but U is excluded.\n\nWhat about COHOG? Not common.\n\nPerhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.\n\nWords: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.\n\nLetters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.\n\nBut we have two Y\'s. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn\'t indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters.\n\nAnother word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.\n\nCOZEN: but E is excluded.\n\nCOBLE? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.\n\nWe are having trouble. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.\n\nCOLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.\n\nCOLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.\n\nCOLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.\n\nCOMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.\n\nCOMPT? Not a word.\n\nCONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.\n\nCONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.\n\nSo, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must start with CO.\n\nLet me try to find words:\n\n- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).\n- COWLY: not a word.\n- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.\n- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.\n- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.\n- COVED: E excluded.\n- COVET: E excluded.\n- COWLS: S excluded.\n- COYPU: U excluded.\n- COZES: E and S excluded.\n\nAnother word: COHOG? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nCOHOS? S excluded.\n\nCOKED? E excluded.\n\nCOLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.\n\nBut we don\'t know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess O in that position.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.\n\nSo, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSo, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.\n\n""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.\n\nSimilarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.\n\nSo ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.\n\n""COWED"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.\n\n""COBBS"" has S.\n\nWhat about ""COBOL""? It\'s a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let\'s avoid if possible.\n\n""COHOG"" is not common.\n\n""COYPU"" has U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.\n\n""COGON"" - not.\n\n""COKED"" - has E.\n\n""COLED"" - has E.\n\n""COMAE"" - has A and E.\n\n""COMAL"" - A excluded.\n\n""COMBY"" - not a word.\n\n""COMMY"" - not common.\n\n""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.\n\nBut we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.\n\nAnother word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COWED"" - E.\n\n""COWPS"" - not a word.\n\n""COXED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COYED"" - E.\n\n""COZED"" - E.\n\nSo, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.\n\nSo for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.\n\nMoreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".\n\nBut note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.\n\nIn fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.\n\nSo, guess: COMFY\n\nIf we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.\n\nSo, let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.\n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.\n- I chose **COMFY** because:\n  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.\n  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).\n  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.\n  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").\n\nThis guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>COMFY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:
1. RAISE: All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position, U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in the last position.

From this, we know:
- The word starts with ""CO"" and ends with ""Y"", so it is ""CO??Y"".
- Excluded letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F. (All marked absent in previous guesses)
- Thus, the third and fourth letters must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is in the word but already placed at the end)

Now, the word is in the form: C O _ _ Y

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern and uses letters only from the available set (avoiding excluded ones).

Possible letters for the 3rd and 4th positions: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common words fitting ""CO??Y"":
- COWY (not a word)
- COPY: But O is already in position 2, and P is available, but COPY would be C,O,P,Y - but it's only 4 letters? No, COPY is 4 letters. We need 5.
- CODLY: Contains D and L, but we need 5 letters and ""CODLY"" isn't a valid word.
- COGNY: Not a word.
- COILY: But I is excluded (from Guess 1). Not allowed.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y. This is a valid word (to make dirty or black). Letters: L is available and repeated? The excluded list doesn't forbid repetition, so this is possible. But we have to see if it fits.
- COMET: E and T excluded? E and T are both excluded (E from Guess 1, T from Guess 2). No.
- CORNY: R excluded? R is excluded. No.
- COVEY: E excluded? E is excluded. No.

After research, some possible words:
- COBZY? Not a word.
- COHOG? Not common.
- COLBY: This is a proper noun (a type of cheese). C,O,L,B,Y. It uses L and B, both available. Is it accepted? In some word games, proper nouns might be disallowed, but if we're strict, it might be considered valid.

But note: COLBY is a common word (a cheese), so it might be acceptable.

Other options:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. But P repeated. And is it a word? Yes, meaning like a coppice. But we need to check.

Wait, COPPY has two P's. But let's see:

More common words:
- COPY is 4 letters.

Wait, I think I missed: the word must be 5 letters. So ""COPY"" isn't an option.

Another word: COMAY? Not a word.

COVAY? Not.

Focusing: ""CO??Y""

- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y
- COVET: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWED: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWLS: S excluded? S is excluded. No.
- COYPU: U excluded? U is excluded. No.

How about:
- COLLY: As mentioned, C,O,L,L,Y (with repeated L). It's valid.
- CODLY: Not a word.
- COGON: Not a word.

Another possibility: COOEY? But O repeated? And E? E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O's? Not matching.

Wait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.

Let me think: 
- COLBY: seems acceptable.
- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.

Words ending with ""Y"":
- Probably an adjective or adverb.

Common patterns:
- COWY: not a word.
- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B's.

But in the available letters, B is allowed.

Other words:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.
- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.

So contenders:
- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)

Since COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.

But note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.

But to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.

Alternatively, we might consider words that don't repeat letters to get more coverage.

Another word: COVAY? Not valid.

COWHY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not.

Is there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.

COLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.

COLLY and COLBY seem primary options.

Let's choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.

So, guess COLBY.

If we get feedback:
- If L is correct/partial, we know.
- Similarly for B.

This will help narrow down.

Another option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.

Hence, the next guess: COLBY

Note: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.

Let me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?
Letters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Suppose:
- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY
- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.
- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.
- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.
- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.
- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.

Similarly:
- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.
- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.

Another common one: BURLY? Doesn't start with CO.

So COLBY seems the best bet.

Therefore, we'll go with COLBY.
</think>
We have feedback from three guesses:  
1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  
2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  
3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  
- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  
- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  
- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  
  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  
  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  
  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  
- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  
- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  
- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don't fit the `?Y` ending requirement.  

<guess>COLBY</guess>",COLBY,"We have feedback from three guesses:
1. RAISE: All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position, U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in the last position.

From this, we know:
- The word starts with ""CO"" and ends with ""Y"", so it is ""CO??Y"".
- Excluded letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F. (All marked absent in previous guesses)
- Thus, the third and fourth letters must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is in the word but already placed at the end)

Now, the word is in the form: C O _ _ Y

- COGNY: Not a word.
- COILY: But I is excluded (from Guess 1). Not allowed.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y. This is a valid word (to make dirty or black). Letters: L is available and repeated? The excluded list doesn't forbid repetition, so this is possible. But we have to see if it fits.
- COMET: E and T excluded? E and T are both excluded (E from Guess 1, T from Guess 2). No.
- CORNY: R excluded? R is excluded. No.
- COVEY: E excluded? E is excluded. No.

After research, some possible words:
- COBZY? Not a word.

Wait, COPPY has two P's. But let's see:

More common words:

- COGON: Not a word.

Another possibility: COOEY? But O repeated? And E? E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O's? Not matching.

Wait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.

Let me think: 
- COLBY: seems acceptable.
- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.

Words ending with ""Y"":
- Probably an adjective or adverb.

Common patterns:
- COWY: not a word.
- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B's.

But in the available letters, B is allowed.

Other words:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.
- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.

So contenders:
- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)

Since COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.

But note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.

But to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.

Alternatively, we might consider words that don't repeat letters to get more coverage.

Another word: COVAY? Not valid.

COWHY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not.

Is there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.

COLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.

COLLY and COLBY seem primary options.

Let's choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.

So, guess COLBY.

If we get feedback:
- If L is correct/partial, we know.
- Similarly for B.

This will help narrow down.

Another option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.

Hence, the next guess: COLBY

Note: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.

Let me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?
Letters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Suppose:
- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY
- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.
- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.
- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.
- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.
- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.

Similarly:
- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.
- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.

Another common one: BURLY? Doesn't start with CO.

So COLBY seems the best bet.

Therefore, we'll go with COLBY.We have feedback from three guesses:  
1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  
2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  
3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  
- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  
- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  
- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  
  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  
  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  
  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  
- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  
- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  
- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don't fit the `?Y` ending requirement.",Guess 4: COLBY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. There is no feedback yet, so I need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should include common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering these, I choose ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) which are common.
 - It has two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, which gives more information about which letters are present or absent.

 My first guess: RAISE<thinking>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically use common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:

- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.
- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.

This initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.

 We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).

 We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.

 Some candidate words that don't use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:

 Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T
 Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.
 Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.
 Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.

 Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 Let's list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.

 Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.

 Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.

 We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).

 However, we don't know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.

 Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:
 - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.
 - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.

 Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.

 Let me compare:
 - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T
 - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H

 Both are valid. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.

 So, the next guess: COUNT

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".<thinking>
The feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). 

For the next guess:
- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:
  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.
- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.

This guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.
</thinking>

<guess>COUNT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

2. COUNT: 
   - C is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter is C.
   - O is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is O.
   - U is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain U.
   - N is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain N.
   - T is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain T.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CO"" (first two letters are C and O).
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

So the secret word is of the form: C O _ _ _

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels): 
We have used: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, U, N, T. 
So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Y can be a vowel)

But note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.

We must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common patterns for ""CO___"" words:

- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.

Some possibilities:
- COLD: but L and D are available? Let's check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.

We need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don't contain the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

So, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let's check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.
- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.
- COWER: but E and R are excluded.
- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).
- COMBY: not a word.
- COHOG: not common.

Let me list some valid words:

- COLDY? Not a word.
- COMA: only 4 letters.
- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don't have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don't know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another O. However, we don't have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven't done that.

But note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.

Another word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.

Another: COWLY? Not a word.

COBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O's. And B and L are available.

But let's see if we can find more common words.

COVEY: but E is excluded.

COZEY? E is excluded.

COPPY? Not common.

COGNY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not a word.

COVED? But E is excluded.

Maybe words like:

- COULD: but U is excluded.
- COUNT: we already tried, and it had U, N, T which are absent.

Another idea: COMBY? Not a word.

How about COALY? But A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Perhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.

Another: COWPY? Not a word.

Or COYPU? But U is excluded and it's an animal, but U is excluded.

What about COHOG? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.

Words: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.

Letters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.

But we have two Y's. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn't indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it's possible.

But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

Another word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.

COZEN: but E is excluded.

COBLE? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

Perhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.

We are having trouble. Let me think of common words.

Another common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.

COLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.

COLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.

COLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.

COLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.

COMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.

COMPT? Not a word.

CONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.

CONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.

So, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must start with CO.

Let me try to find words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).
- COWLY: not a word.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.
- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.
- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.
- COVED: E excluded.
- COVET: E excluded.
- COWLS: S excluded.
- COYPU: U excluded.
- COZES: E and S excluded.

Another word: COHOG? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

COHOS? S excluded.

COKED? E excluded.

COLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.

COLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.

But we don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it's possible.

But let's see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.

Another word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn't guess O in that position.

But to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.

So, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven't tried.

We know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

So, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.

""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.

Similarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.

So ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.

We can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.

""COWED"" has E.

Another word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.

""COBBS"" has S.

What about ""COBOL""? It's a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let's avoid if possible.

""COHOG"" is not common.

""COYPU"" has U.

Another possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.

""COGON"" - not.

""COKED"" - has E.

""COLED"" - has E.

""COMAE"" - has A and E.

""COMAL"" - A excluded.

""COMBY"" - not a word.

""COMMY"" - not common.

""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.

But we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.

Similarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.

Another word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.

""COWED"" - E.

""COWPS"" - not a word.

""COXED"" - E excluded.

""COYED"" - E.

""COZED"" - E.

So, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.

But ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.

Similarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.

But ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.

So for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.

Moreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.

Therefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".

But note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.

In fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.

So, guess: COMFY

If we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.

For the next guess:
- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.
- I chose **COMFY** because:
  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.
  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).
  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.
  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").

This guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>COMFY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:
1. RAISE: All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position, U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in the last position.

From this, we know:
- The word starts with ""CO"" and ends with ""Y"", so it is ""CO??Y"".
- Excluded letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F. (All marked absent in previous guesses)
- Thus, the third and fourth letters must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is in the word but already placed at the end)

Now, the word is in the form: C O _ _ Y

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern and uses letters only from the available set (avoiding excluded ones).

Possible letters for the 3rd and 4th positions: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common words fitting ""CO??Y"":
- COWY (not a word)
- COPY: But O is already in position 2, and P is available, but COPY would be C,O,P,Y - but it's only 4 letters? No, COPY is 4 letters. We need 5.
- CODLY: Contains D and L, but we need 5 letters and ""CODLY"" isn't a valid word.
- COGNY: Not a word.
- COILY: But I is excluded (from Guess 1). Not allowed.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y. This is a valid word (to make dirty or black). Letters: L is available and repeated? The excluded list doesn't forbid repetition, so this is possible. But we have to see if it fits.
- COMET: E and T excluded? E and T are both excluded (E from Guess 1, T from Guess 2). No.
- CORNY: R excluded? R is excluded. No.
- COVEY: E excluded? E is excluded. No.

After research, some possible words:
- COBZY? Not a word.
- COHOG? Not common.
- COLBY: This is a proper noun (a type of cheese). C,O,L,B,Y. It uses L and B, both available. Is it accepted? In some word games, proper nouns might be disallowed, but if we're strict, it might be considered valid.

But note: COLBY is a common word (a cheese), so it might be acceptable.

Other options:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. But P repeated. And is it a word? Yes, meaning like a coppice. But we need to check.

Wait, COPPY has two P's. But let's see:

More common words:
- COPY is 4 letters.

Wait, I think I missed: the word must be 5 letters. So ""COPY"" isn't an option.

Another word: COMAY? Not a word.

COVAY? Not.

Focusing: ""CO??Y""

- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y
- COVET: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWED: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWLS: S excluded? S is excluded. No.
- COYPU: U excluded? U is excluded. No.

How about:
- COLLY: As mentioned, C,O,L,L,Y (with repeated L). It's valid.
- CODLY: Not a word.
- COGON: Not a word.

Another possibility: COOEY? But O repeated? And E? E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O's? Not matching.

Wait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.

Let me think: 
- COLBY: seems acceptable.
- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.

Words ending with ""Y"":
- Probably an adjective or adverb.

Common patterns:
- COWY: not a word.
- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B's.

But in the available letters, B is allowed.

Other words:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.
- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.

So contenders:
- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)

Since COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.

But note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.

But to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.

Alternatively, we might consider words that don't repeat letters to get more coverage.

Another word: COVAY? Not valid.

COWHY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not.

Is there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.

COLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.

COLLY and COLBY seem primary options.

Let's choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.

So, guess COLBY.

If we get feedback:
- If L is correct/partial, we know.
- Similarly for B.

This will help narrow down.

Another option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.

Hence, the next guess: COLBY

Note: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.

Let me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?
Letters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Suppose:
- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY
- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.
- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.
- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.
- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.
- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.

Similarly:
- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.
- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.

Another common one: BURLY? Doesn't start with CO.

So COLBY seems the best bet.

Therefore, we'll go with COLBY.We have feedback from three guesses:  
1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  
2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  
3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  
- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  
- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  
- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  
  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  
  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  
  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  
- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  
- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  
- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don't fit the `?Y` ending requirement.

There is no feedback yet, so I need to make an initial guess.\n A good starting word should include common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.\n Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.\n Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.\n\n Considering these, I choose ""RAISE"" because:\n - It has three vowels (A, I, E) which are common.\n - It has two common consonants (R, S).\n - All letters are distinct, which gives more information about which letters are present or absent.\n\n My first guess: RAISE<thinking>\nFor the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically use common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I\'ll choose ""RAISE"" because:\n\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.\n- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.\n\nThis initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as \'x\', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.\n This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.\n\n We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).\n\n We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.\n\n Some candidate words that don\'t use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:\n\n Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T\n Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.\n Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.\n Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.\n\n However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.\n\n Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.\n\n Let\'s list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\n We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.\n\n Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.\n\n Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.\n\n We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).\n\n However, we don\'t know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.\n\n Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.\n\n I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:\n - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.\n - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.\n\n Let me compare:\n - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T\n - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H\n\n Both are valid. We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.\n\n So, the next guess: COUNT\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid.

Not a word.\n- COMA: only 4 letters.\n- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don\'t know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don\'t have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don\'t know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but that doesn\'t prevent the word from having another O. However, we don\'t have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven\'t done that.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.\n\nAnother word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.\n\nAnother: COWLY? Not a word.\n\nCOBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O\'s. And B and L are available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n\nCOVEY: but E is excluded.\n\nCOZEY? E is excluded.\n\nCOPPY? Not common.\n\nCOGNY? Not a word.\n\nCODLY? Not a word.\n\nCOVED?

But A is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nPerhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: COWPY? Not a word.\n\nOr COYPU? But U is excluded and it\'s an animal, but U is excluded.\n\nWhat about COHOG? Not common.\n\nPerhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.\n\nWords: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.\n\nLetters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.\n\nBut we have two Y\'s. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn\'t indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters.\n\nAnother word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.\n\nCOZEN: but E is excluded.\n\nCOBLE? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.\n\nWe are having trouble. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.\n\nCOLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.\n\nCOLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.\n\nCOLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.\n\nCOMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.\n\nCOMPT? Not a word.\n\nCONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.\n\nCONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.\n\nSo, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must start with CO.\n\nLet me try to find words:\n\n- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).\n- COWLY: not a word.\n- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.\n- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.\n- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.\n- COVED: E excluded.\n- COVET: E excluded.\n- COWLS: S excluded.\n- COYPU: U excluded.\n- COZES: E and S excluded.\n\nAnother word: COHOG? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nCOHOS? S excluded.\n\nCOKED? E excluded.\n\nCOLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.\n\nBut we don\'t know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess O in that position.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.\n\nSo, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSo, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.\n\n""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.\n\nSimilarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.\n\nSo ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.\n\n""COWED"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.\n\n""COBBS"" has S.\n\nWhat about ""COBOL""? It\'s a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let\'s avoid if possible.\n\n""COHOG"" is not common.\n\n""COYPU"" has U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.\n\n""COGON"" - not.\n\n""COKED"" - has E.\n\n""COLED"" - has E.\n\n""COMAE"" - has A and E.\n\n""COMAL"" - A excluded.\n\n""COMBY"" - not a word.\n\n""COMMY"" - not common.\n\n""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.\n\nBut we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.\n\nAnother word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COWED"" - E.\n\n""COWPS"" - not a word.\n\n""COXED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COYED"" - E.\n\n""COZED"" - E.\n\nSo, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.\n\nSo for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.\n\nMoreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".\n\nBut note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.\n\nIn fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.\n\nSo, guess: COMFY\n\nIf we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.\n\nSo, let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.\n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.\n- I chose **COMFY** because:\n  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.\n  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).\n  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.\n  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").\n\nThis guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>COMFY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n1.

(Y is in the word but already placed at the end)\n\nNow, the word is in the form: C O _ _ Y\n\nWe need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern and uses letters only from the available set (avoiding excluded ones).\n\nPossible letters for the 3rd and 4th positions: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nCommon words fitting ""CO??Y"":\n- COWY (not a word)\n- COPY: But O is already in position 2, and P is available, but COPY would be C,O,P,Y - but it\'s only 4 letters? No, COPY is 4 letters. We need 5.\n- CODLY: Contains D and L, but we need 5 letters and ""CODLY"" isn\'t a valid word.\n- COGNY: Not a word.\n- COILY: But I is excluded (from Guess 1). Not allowed.\n- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y. This is a valid word (to make dirty or black). Letters: L is available and repeated? The excluded list doesn\'t forbid repetition, so this is possible. But we have to see if it fits.\n- COMET: E and T excluded? E and T are both excluded (E from Guess 1, T from Guess 2). No.\n- CORNY: R excluded? R is excluded. No.\n- COVEY: E excluded? E is excluded. No.\n\nAfter research, some possible words:\n- COBZY? Not a word.\n- COHOG? Not common.\n- COLBY: This is a proper noun (a type of cheese). C,O,L,B,Y. It uses L and B, both available. Is it accepted? In some word games, proper nouns might be disallowed, but if we\'re strict, it might be considered valid.\n\nBut note: COLBY is a common word (a cheese), so it might be acceptable.\n\nOther options:\n- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. But P repeated. And is it a word? Yes, meaning like a coppice. But we need to check.\n\nWait, COPPY has two P\'s. But let\'s see:\n\nMore common words:\n- COPY is 4 letters.\n\nWait, I think I missed: the word must be 5 letters. So ""COPY"" isn\'t an option.\n\nAnother word: COMAY? Not a word.\n\nCOVAY? Not.\n\nFocusing: ""CO??Y""\n\n- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y\n- COVET: E excluded? E is excluded. No.\n- COWED: E excluded? E is excluded. No.\n- COWLS: S excluded? S is excluded. No.\n- COYPU: U excluded? U is excluded. No.\n\nHow about:\n- COLLY: As mentioned, C,O,L,L,Y (with repeated L). It\'s valid.\n- CODLY: Not a word.\n- COGON: Not a word.\n\nAnother possibility: COOEY? But O repeated? And E? E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O\'s? Not matching.\n\nWait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.\n\nLet me think: \n- COLBY: seems acceptable.\n- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.\n\nWords ending with ""Y"":\n- Probably an adjective or adverb.\n\nCommon patterns:\n- COWY: not a word.\n- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.\n- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B\'s.\n\nBut in the available letters, B is allowed.\n\nOther words:\n- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.\n- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.\n\nSo contenders:\n- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.\n- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)\n- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)\n- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)\n\nSince COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.\n\nBut note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.\n\nBut to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider words that don\'t repeat letters to get more coverage.\n\nAnother word: COVAY? Not valid.\n\nCOWHY? Not a word.\n\nCODLY? Not.\n\nIs there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.\n\nCOLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.\n\nCOLLY and COLBY seem primary options.\n\nLet\'s choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.\n\nSo, guess COLBY.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If L is correct/partial, we know.\n- Similarly for B.\n\nThis will help narrow down.\n\nAnother option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.\n\nHence, the next guess: COLBY\n\nNote: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.\n\nLet me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?\nLetters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nSuppose:\n- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY\n- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.\n\nSimilarly:\n- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.\n\nAnother common one: BURLY? Doesn\'t start with CO.\n\nSo COLBY seems the best bet.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll go with COLBY.We have feedback from three guesses:  \n1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  \n2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  \n3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  \n\n### Key Insights:  \n- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  \n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  \n- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  \n- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  \n\n### Next Guess Strategy:  \n- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  \n- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  \n  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  \n  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  \n  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  \n- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  \n- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  \n- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don\'t fit the `?Y` ending requirement.\n\n<guess>COLBY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: COLBY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:
1. RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> all absent (x). So none of these letters are in the word.
2. COUNT: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), U(x), N(x), T(x) -> so U, N, T are absent. Secret word starts with ""CO"".
3. COMFY: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), M(x), F(x), Y(✓ position 5). So M and F absent, and the word ends with Y. Thus the secret word is ""CO??Y"".
4. COLBY: C(✓), O(✓), L(- meaning present but wrong position), B(x), Y(✓). So B is absent, and L is in the word but not in position 3.

From the feedback:
- The secret word is ""CO??Y"".
- Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from guesses 1,2,3,4). Also, from COUNT and COMFY we have more, but let's compile all exclusions.
  Total absent: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- Present letters: From feedback, we know C, O, Y are in and in correct positions (1,2,5). Also, L is present but not in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).
- The word has five letters: position 1=C, 2=O, 5=Y, and we need positions 3 and 4.

Because L is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are occupied and fixed). So L should be in position 4.

Let me confirm: the only positions available are 3 and 4. Position 3 cannot be L (because feedback for L in position 3 was 'wrong position' meaning it's not there), and positions 1,2,5 are taken. So L must be in position 4.

Thus, we deduce that the fourth letter is L.

Therefore, the secret word is ""CO"" + ? + L + ""Y"" -> ""CO?LY"".

Now, we need to find the third letter. It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.

Also, it cannot be C, O, Y, or L because:
- C and O are already used in positions 1 and 2. But could they repeat? The feedback hasn't shown repeated letters, but we must consider the possibility. However, from COLBY, we have L in the word and it was in position 3 but marked as wrong, meaning if there was another L, it might have been marked differently? But the feedback for position 4 wasn't given because we didn't guess a letter there in COLBY? In COLBY: position 4 was B, which was absent. So we don't know about position 4 until now.

But logically: since L is in the word and not in position 3, and the only open spot is position 4, it must be there. There is no other position. Therefore, position 4 is L.

So the word is ""CO?LY"".

Now, for position 3, we need a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- And is available. The available letters are from the alphabet minus the absent letters and minus the known present letters? We know we have C, O, L, Y. But since positions are fixed, we only need one more letter for position 3.

Available letters (not absent and not fixed): From a-z, remove absent and used letters? But we haven't used all present letters because we might have more.

Actually, the word has five letters. We have four: C,O,L,Y. So the fifth letter is at position 3.

And that letter must not be absent. So available letters: all letters not in the absent list.

Absent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B (11 letters). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining: 15 letters.

But we don't know which ones, but we don't need to list all. We also know that the letter hasn't appeared in any guess? Not necessarily, but we can infer.

Common vowels? But many vowels were excluded: A,E,I,U are absent. O is already used (position 2). So vowels: O is in, but available vowels? O might repeat? Other vowels: only Y? Y is also in position 5.

But Y is already at the end. So position 3 must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but with the vowels excluded, the possible letters are consonants and perhaps Y (but Y is fixed at end).

Available letters: include D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and perhaps others.

Now, we need a valid English word ""CO?LY"".

What words are formed? Let me think of English words that match ""CO?LY"":

- COWLY: not common, and W available? But let's see if valid.
- COGLE: but E excluded? E is excluded.
- COMET: excluded letters (M,E).
- Any others?
- COLLY: But we already guessed COL?Y, and in COLBY we guessed L in position 3 and B in 4, but L was wrong position. Now we think L is in position 4. But COLLY would be C,O,L,L,Y? So position 3: L and position 4: L? That is, repeated L. But in COLBY, we had L at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (-), which confirms L is present but not in 3. So in COLLY, it would have L at positions 3 and 4? But we think position 3 shouldn't be L? So it would contradict? Moreover, COLLY has two L's. But the secret word must have L in position 4, and position 3 could be something else.

Words:
- GODLY: doesn't start with CO.
- HOTLY: starts with H.

Common words: 
- COOLY: But O repeated? And L? C,O,O,L,Y. This word exists (variant of coolie, but meaning a plain or a valley). It has two O's? Position 1:C,2:O, position 3 would be O? Then positions 4:L,5:Y -> COOLY? But in COUNT, O is in position 2, and if we have another O in position 3, it was not tested? In COUNT we had O only in position 2. And in COMFY we had M and F absent, but O was at 2. So repeated O is possible? But in the secret word, if it is COOLY, then position 3: O? And position 4:L, position 5:Y.

But let's see: the letter O for position 3. Was O excluded? No, we know O is present in the word, but only in position 2 so far. Could there be another O? Possibly.

So COOLY is a candidate: C, O, O, L, Y.

But we have to check: if we guess COOLY, the feedback: position 1:C (✓), 2:O (✓), 3:O? Since O is in the word and position 3? There might be two O's. The feedback might mark position 3 O as ""correct"" if the secret word has O at 3, or as ""present"" if it has another O? But rules: if it's in the word and correct position, it's ✓; if present but wrong position, then -; if absent, x.

If the secret word has O only in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 would be marked as absent or present? Since only one O exists? But we don't know the letter frequency.

Similarly, in COOLY, if the secret word is COOLY, then all positions correct: ✓,✓,✓,✓,✓.

But if it has only one O, then position 3 O would be absent? But we don't know.

But in our case, we have no feedback preventing O in position 3.

However, we have very few remaining letters. Other candidates?

COULD: excluded letters? U and L? But U is excluded? In COUNT: U absent.

COMBY: M and F? M excluded? In COMFY: M absent? Yes.

Another word: COVIN: but I excluded and doesn't end with Y.

Let me list possible letters for position 3.

Available: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Words:
- Only?LY: e.g., COWLY: C,O,W,L,Y. Is ""cowly"" a word? Meaning like a cow? Not standard, but possible.

Other options:
- COALLY: too long.
- COGLY? Not a word.
- COHOS: S excluded? S excluded.

Perhaps:
- CODLY: D? But ""codly"" not common and might not be valid? Or COD LY as separate? Not a word.
- COPAL: A excluded? A excluded and ends with L? We need Y.
- COVED: E excluded.

Another: COOED: E excluded.

So COOLY seems the most plausible: C,O,O,L,Y.

But it does have repeated O? And we have not eliminated O as a possibility for position 3.

Moreover, in the feedback, we never had any indication of multiple O's? So it's possible.

Other words: 
- COVARY: V? But A excluded? And ends with Y? C,O,V,A,R,Y? Too long? No, 6 letters? COVARY? Actually, ""covary"" might be 6 letters? Varied.

Perhaps: COZLY? Not a word.

After research, COOLY is a valid word.

But let's see if there are others:

- COLDLY: too long? 6 letters.
- COWLY: Some dictionaries accept ""cowly"" as an adjective meaning cow-like? But rare.

But COOLY is better.

Moreover, we have used L in position 4 and O in 3? In COOLY, O is position 3 and L is position 4? Yes.

Now, an alternative: let's see the word DOILY? Doesn't start with CO.

Therefore, COOLY is a candidate.

But we need to confirm: we have guessed before? No, we have not used O in position 3.

Another possibility: LOWLY? Doesn't start with CO.

CO-W something? Not.

So, COOLY seems the most likely.

Perhaps: COILY? But I is excluded? Yes, I excluded.

Therefore, I will guess COOLY.

But note: we have only two tries left? Guesses: 4 already done, so we have two more? The game has 6 tries, we are on the fifth guess.

Possible outcome: if COOLY is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But there might be other words? Such as COWLY? Let me try:

COWLY: W available? But we haven't tested W.

With so few letters left, we might need to use this guess to test? But since we deduced that position 4 must be L, and position 3 must be one letter from the available set, and COOLY is a word, it is a strong candidate.

Another word: COPLY? Not a word.

COHOG? Does not end with Y.

Hence, guess COOLY.

So, the fifth guess: COOLY

<thinking>
Recap:  
- The secret word pattern is **`CO?LY`** (positions 1:C, 2:O, 4:L, 5:Y).  
- **L** must be in position 4 because it was present but incorrectly placed in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).  
- The missing letter must not be excluded: Absent letters = R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from previous feedback).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **COOLY** (valid word, meaning a small valley): C,O,O,L,Y → O repeated in position 3?  
  - Other options like COWLY (rarely used) or CODLY (invalid) are weaker.

Why COOLY?  
- Position 3 candidate = **O** (among others). Since O is already confirmed in the word (position 2), we can't rule out repetition.  
- If COOLY is correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If not, feedback will reveal if O is absent (x), misplaced (-), or correct (✓) in position 3, or confirm L/Y positions.  

This guess decisively tests the only plausible common word fitting the pattern.  
</thinking>  

<guess>COOLY</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in word).  
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  
- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  
- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **`CO?LY`**:  
  - Position 1: **C** (fixed)  
  - Position 2: **O** (fixed)  
  - Position 4: **L** (deduced from misplacement in position 3 and no other open positions).  
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed)  
- Position 3 requires a letter not excluded and not yet tested: Available letters are **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z** (absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B).  
- **COOLY** (a valid English word meaning a small valley or an alternative form of ""coolie"") fits the pattern:  
  - It tests position 3 with **O** (a repeat of position 2's letter, which is allowed).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O in position 3 will clarify if repetition is valid or if we need to target other letters (e.g., H, P, W) for position 3.  

<guess>COOLY</guess>",COOLY,"We have feedback from four guesses:
1. RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> all absent (x). So none of these letters are in the word.
2. COUNT: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), U(x), N(x), T(x) -> so U, N, T are absent. Secret word starts with ""CO"".
3. COMFY: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), M(x), F(x), Y(✓ position 5). So M and F absent, and the word ends with Y. Thus the secret word is ""CO??Y"".
4. COLBY: C(✓), O(✓), L(- meaning present but wrong position), B(x), Y(✓). So B is absent, and L is in the word but not in position 3.

From the feedback:
- The secret word is ""CO??Y"".
- Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from guesses 1,2,3,4). Also, from COUNT and COMFY we have more, but let's compile all exclusions.
  Total absent: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- Present letters: From feedback, we know C, O, Y are in and in correct positions (1,2,5). Also, L is present but not in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).
- The word has five letters: position 1=C, 2=O, 5=Y, and we need positions 3 and 4.

Because L is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are occupied and fixed). So L should be in position 4.

Let me confirm: the only positions available are 3 and 4. Position 3 cannot be L (because feedback for L in position 3 was 'wrong position' meaning it's not there), and positions 1,2,5 are taken. So L must be in position 4.

Thus, we deduce that the fourth letter is L.

Therefore, the secret word is ""CO"" + ? + L + ""Y"" -> ""CO?LY"".

Now, we need to find the third letter. It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.

Also, it cannot be C, O, Y, or L because:
- C and O are already used in positions 1 and 2. But could they repeat? The feedback hasn't shown repeated letters, but we must consider the possibility. However, from COLBY, we have L in the word and it was in position 3 but marked as wrong, meaning if there was another L, it might have been marked differently? But the feedback for position 4 wasn't given because we didn't guess a letter there in COLBY? In COLBY: position 4 was B, which was absent. So we don't know about position 4 until now.

But logically: since L is in the word and not in position 3, and the only open spot is position 4, it must be there. There is no other position. Therefore, position 4 is L.

So the word is ""CO?LY"".

Now, for position 3, we need a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- And is available. The available letters are from the alphabet minus the absent letters and minus the known present letters? We know we have C, O, L, Y. But since positions are fixed, we only need one more letter for position 3.

Available letters (not absent and not fixed): From a-z, remove absent and used letters? But we haven't used all present letters because we might have more.

Actually, the word has five letters. We have four: C,O,L,Y. So the fifth letter is at position 3.

And that letter must not be absent. So available letters: all letters not in the absent list.

Absent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B (11 letters). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining: 15 letters.

But we don't know which ones, but we don't need to list all. We also know that the letter hasn't appeared in any guess? Not necessarily, but we can infer.

Common vowels? But many vowels were excluded: A,E,I,U are absent. O is already used (position 2). So vowels: O is in, but available vowels? O might repeat? Other vowels: only Y? Y is also in position 5.

But Y is already at the end. So position 3 must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but with the vowels excluded, the possible letters are consonants and perhaps Y (but Y is fixed at end).

Available letters: include D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and perhaps others.

Now, we need a valid English word ""CO?LY"".

What words are formed? Let me think of English words that match ""CO?LY"":

- COWLY: not common, and W available? But let's see if valid.
- COGLE: but E excluded? E is excluded.
- COMET: excluded letters (M,E).
- Any others?
- COLLY: But we already guessed COL?Y, and in COLBY we guessed L in position 3 and B in 4, but L was wrong position. Now we think L is in position 4. But COLLY would be C,O,L,L,Y? So position 3: L and position 4: L? That is, repeated L. But in COLBY, we had L at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (-), which confirms L is present but not in 3. So in COLLY, it would have L at positions 3 and 4? But we think position 3 shouldn't be L? So it would contradict? Moreover, COLLY has two L's. But the secret word must have L in position 4, and position 3 could be something else.

Words:
- GODLY: doesn't start with CO.
- HOTLY: starts with H.

Common words: 
- COOLY: But O repeated? And L? C,O,O,L,Y. This word exists (variant of coolie, but meaning a plain or a valley). It has two O's? Position 1:C,2:O, position 3 would be O? Then positions 4:L,5:Y -> COOLY? But in COUNT, O is in position 2, and if we have another O in position 3, it was not tested? In COUNT we had O only in position 2. And in COMFY we had M and F absent, but O was at 2. So repeated O is possible? But in the secret word, if it is COOLY, then position 3: O? And position 4:L, position 5:Y.

But let's see: the letter O for position 3. Was O excluded? No, we know O is present in the word, but only in position 2 so far. Could there be another O? Possibly.

So COOLY is a candidate: C, O, O, L, Y.

But we have to check: if we guess COOLY, the feedback: position 1:C (✓), 2:O (✓), 3:O? Since O is in the word and position 3? There might be two O's. The feedback might mark position 3 O as ""correct"" if the secret word has O at 3, or as ""present"" if it has another O? But rules: if it's in the word and correct position, it's ✓; if present but wrong position, then -; if absent, x.

If the secret word has O only in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 would be marked as absent or present? Since only one O exists? But we don't know the letter frequency.

Similarly, in COOLY, if the secret word is COOLY, then all positions correct: ✓,✓,✓,✓,✓.

But if it has only one O, then position 3 O would be absent? But we don't know.

But in our case, we have no feedback preventing O in position 3.

However, we have very few remaining letters. Other candidates?

COULD: excluded letters? U and L? But U is excluded? In COUNT: U absent.

COMBY: M and F? M excluded? In COMFY: M absent? Yes.

Another word: COVIN: but I excluded and doesn't end with Y.

Let me list possible letters for position 3.

Available: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Words:
- Only?LY: e.g., COWLY: C,O,W,L,Y. Is ""cowly"" a word? Meaning like a cow? Not standard, but possible.

Other options:
- COALLY: too long.
- COGLY? Not a word.
- COHOS: S excluded? S excluded.

Perhaps:
- CODLY: D? But ""codly"" not common and might not be valid? Or COD LY as separate? Not a word.
- COPAL: A excluded? A excluded and ends with L? We need Y.
- COVED: E excluded.

Another: COOED: E excluded.

So COOLY seems the most plausible: C,O,O,L,Y.

But it does have repeated O? And we have not eliminated O as a possibility for position 3.

Moreover, in the feedback, we never had any indication of multiple O's? So it's possible.

Other words: 
- COVARY: V? But A excluded? And ends with Y? C,O,V,A,R,Y? Too long? No, 6 letters? COVARY? Actually, ""covary"" might be 6 letters? Varied.

Perhaps: COZLY? Not a word.

After research, COOLY is a valid word.

But let's see if there are others:

- COLDLY: too long? 6 letters.
- COWLY: Some dictionaries accept ""cowly"" as an adjective meaning cow-like? But rare.

But COOLY is better.

Moreover, we have used L in position 4 and O in 3? In COOLY, O is position 3 and L is position 4? Yes.

Now, an alternative: let's see the word DOILY? Doesn't start with CO.

Therefore, COOLY is a candidate.

But we need to confirm: we have guessed before? No, we have not used O in position 3.

Another possibility: LOWLY? Doesn't start with CO.

CO-W something? Not.

So, COOLY seems the most likely.

Perhaps: COILY? But I is excluded? Yes, I excluded.

Therefore, I will guess COOLY.

But note: we have only two tries left? Guesses: 4 already done, so we have two more? The game has 6 tries, we are on the fifth guess.

Possible outcome: if COOLY is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But there might be other words? Such as COWLY? Let me try:

COWLY: W available? But we haven't tested W.

With so few letters left, we might need to use this guess to test? But since we deduced that position 4 must be L, and position 3 must be one letter from the available set, and COOLY is a word, it is a strong candidate.

Another word: COPLY? Not a word.

COHOG? Does not end with Y.

Hence, guess COOLY.

So, the fifth guess: COOLY

<thinking>
Recap:  
- The secret word pattern is **`CO?LY`** (positions 1:C, 2:O, 4:L, 5:Y).  
- **L** must be in position 4 because it was present but incorrectly placed in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).  
- The missing letter must not be excluded: Absent letters = R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from previous feedback).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **COOLY** (valid word, meaning a small valley): C,O,O,L,Y → O repeated in position 3?  
  - Other options like COWLY (rarely used) or CODLY (invalid) are weaker.

Why COOLY?  
- Position 3 candidate = **O** (among others). Since O is already confirmed in the word (position 2), we can't rule out repetition.  
- If COOLY is correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If not, feedback will reveal if O is absent (x), misplaced (-), or correct (✓) in position 3, or confirm L/Y positions.  

This guess decisively tests the only plausible common word fitting the pattern.  
</thinking>  

<guess>COOLY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in word).  
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  
- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  
- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **`CO?LY`**:  
  - Position 1: **C** (fixed)  
  - Position 2: **O** (fixed)  
  - Position 4: **L** (deduced from misplacement in position 3 and no other open positions).  
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed)  
- Position 3 requires a letter not excluded and not yet tested: Available letters are **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z** (absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B).  
- **COOLY** (a valid English word meaning a small valley or an alternative form of ""coolie"") fits the pattern:  
  - It tests position 3 with **O** (a repeat of position 2's letter, which is allowed).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O in position 3 will clarify if repetition is valid or if we need to target other letters (e.g., H, P, W) for position 3.",Guess 5: COOLY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. There is no feedback yet, so I need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should include common letters and have a balanced letter distribution to maximize information gain.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Considering these, I choose ""RAISE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, I, E) which are common.
 - It has two common consonants (R, S).
 - All letters are distinct, which gives more information about which letters are present or absent.

 My first guess: RAISE<thinking>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starting words typically use common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities. Common vowels and consonants in English include A, E, R, S, T, etc. Words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRATE"" are often recommended, but I'll choose ""RAISE"" because:

- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- All letters are unique, allowing efficient feedback about letter presence/absence.
- It historically performs well by covering a broad portion of the solution space.

This initial guess will clarify which of these frequent letters appear in the secret word and their approximate positions, setting up a strong second guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters R, A, I, S, E are in the secret word.
 This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word contains none of these five letters.

 Therefore, we must choose a new word that does not contain any of the letters R, A, I, S, E.

 We need to pick a word from the remaining letters of the alphabet. We should aim for common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Common consonants that are left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, W, Y (and less common ones like K, V, but we can focus on high frequency).

 We also have vowels left: O, U, Y (as A, E, I are excluded). Note that Y can sometimes act as a vowel.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible. We should avoid repeating the same letters and choose a word with 5 new letters.

 Some candidate words that don't use R, A, I, S, E and use common letters:

 Option 1: ""CLOUT"" - letters: C, L, O, U, T
 Option 2: ""NYMPH"" - but it has Y and is less common, and also has H and P which are less frequent.
 Option 3: ""THUMB"" - has B and M, but we have only 5 letters? Actually, ""THUMB"" is 5 letters: T,H,U,M,B.
 Option 4: ""DOUGH"" - D, O, U, G, H.

 However, we want to maximize the use of common letters and also cover vowels. We have O and U as vowels available.

 Another popular choice: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to be systematic.

 Let's list the most common remaining letters: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can consider ""POULT"" (but not common) or ""COUNT"" (C, O, U, N, T) which has common letters.

 Actually, ""COUNT"" seems good: C, O, U, N, T. It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""MOUNT"" (M, O, U, N, T) is also good.

 Another candidate: ""LYNCH"" but has Y and is less common.

 We might also consider ""BOUND"" (B, O, U, N, D) or ""FOUND"" (F, O, U, N, D).

 However, we don't know which of these are valid words. We must choose a valid English word.

 Since we have no constraints from the first guess, we can choose any word without R,A,I,S,E.

 I think ""COUNT"" is a good choice because:
 - It has the common consonants C, N, T and vowels O, U.
 - It is a common word and will give us information about these letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters R,A,I,S,E, and ""COUNT"" does that.

 Alternatively, ""MOUTH"" (M, O, U, T, H) is also a good candidate because it covers M, T, H and vowels O, U.

 Let me compare:
 - ""COUNT"": C, O, U, N, T
 - ""MOUTH"": M, O, U, T, H

 Both are valid. We can choose either.

 I'll go with ""COUNT"" because it includes the letter N which is very common.

 So, the next guess: COUNT

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. Since the game requires a valid 5-letter English word, and ""COUNT"" is valid, we can use it.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""COUNT"".<thinking>
The feedback for ""RAISE"" shows that none of the letters R, A, I, S, or E are in the secret word. This means the secret word is composed entirely of letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). 

For the next guess:
- I must avoid using any of the excluded letters (R, A, I, S, E).
- I should prioritize common letters not yet tested, such as T, O, U, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
- A strong candidate is ""COUNT"" because:
  - It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (C, O, U, N, T).
  - It covers two vowels (O, U) and three common consonants.
  - If any letters match, their positions will provide valuable clues.
- Alternatives like ""MOUTH"" or ""DOUGH"" were considered, but ""COUNT"" offers slightly better letter frequency coverage.

This guess maximizes information gain while adhering to the constraints.
</thinking>

<guess>COUNT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: R, A, I, S, E.

2. COUNT: 
   - C is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the first letter is C.
   - O is correct and in the correct position (✓) -> so the second letter is O.
   - U is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain U.
   - N is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain N.
   - T is absent (x) -> so the secret word does not contain T.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CO"" (first two letters are C and O).
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.

So the secret word is of the form: C O _ _ _

Now, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters (consonants and vowels): 
We have used: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, U, N, T. 
So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: Y can be a vowel)

But note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.

We must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Common patterns for ""CO___"" words:

- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.

Some possibilities:
- COLD: but L and D are available? Let's check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.

We need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don't contain the excluded letters.

Excluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.

So, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let's check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.
- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.
- COWER: but E and R are excluded.
- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).
- COMBY: not a word.
- COHOG: not common.

Let me list some valid words:

- COLDY? Not a word.
- COMA: only 4 letters.
- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don't have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don't know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it's correct, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another O. However, we don't have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven't done that.

But note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.

Another word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.

Another: COWLY? Not a word.

COBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O's. And B and L are available.

But let's see if we can find more common words.

COVEY: but E is excluded.

COZEY? E is excluded.

COPPY? Not common.

COGNY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not a word.

COVED? But E is excluded.

Maybe words like:

- COULD: but U is excluded.
- COUNT: we already tried, and it had U, N, T which are absent.

Another idea: COMBY? Not a word.

How about COALY? But A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Perhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.

Another: COWPY? Not a word.

Or COYPU? But U is excluded and it's an animal, but U is excluded.

What about COHOG? Not common.

Perhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.

Words: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.

Letters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.

But we have two Y's. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn't indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it's possible.

But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters.

Another word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.

COZEN: but E is excluded.

COBLE? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

Perhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.

We are having trouble. Let me think of common words.

Another common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.

COLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.

COLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.

COLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.

COLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.

COMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.

COMPT? Not a word.

CONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.

CONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.

So, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must start with CO.

Let me try to find words:

- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).
- COWLY: not a word.
- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.
- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.
- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.
- COVED: E excluded.
- COVET: E excluded.
- COWLS: S excluded.
- COYPU: U excluded.
- COZES: E and S excluded.

Another word: COHOG? Not common.

COGON? Not a word.

COHOS? S excluded.

COKED? E excluded.

COLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.

COLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.

But we don't know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it's possible.

But let's see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.

Another word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn't guess O in that position.

But to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.

So, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven't tried.

We know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.

But we must avoid the excluded letters.

So, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.

""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.

Similarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.

So ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.

We can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.

""COWED"" has E.

Another word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.

""COBBS"" has S.

What about ""COBOL""? It's a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let's avoid if possible.

""COHOG"" is not common.

""COYPU"" has U.

Another possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.

""COGON"" - not.

""COKED"" - has E.

""COLED"" - has E.

""COMAE"" - has A and E.

""COMAL"" - A excluded.

""COMBY"" - not a word.

""COMMY"" - not common.

""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.

But we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.

Similarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.

Another word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.

""COWED"" - E.

""COWPS"" - not a word.

""COXED"" - E excluded.

""COYED"" - E.

""COZED"" - E.

So, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.

But ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.

Similarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.

But ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.

So for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.

Moreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.

Therefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".

But note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.

In fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.

So, guess: COMFY

If we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.

For the next guess:
- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.
- I chose **COMFY** because:
  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.
  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).
  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.
  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").

This guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

<guess>COMFY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:
1. RAISE: All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position, U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in the last position.

From this, we know:
- The word starts with ""CO"" and ends with ""Y"", so it is ""CO??Y"".
- Excluded letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F. (All marked absent in previous guesses)
- Thus, the third and fourth letters must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is in the word but already placed at the end)

Now, the word is in the form: C O _ _ Y

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern and uses letters only from the available set (avoiding excluded ones).

Possible letters for the 3rd and 4th positions: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common words fitting ""CO??Y"":
- COWY (not a word)
- COPY: But O is already in position 2, and P is available, but COPY would be C,O,P,Y - but it's only 4 letters? No, COPY is 4 letters. We need 5.
- CODLY: Contains D and L, but we need 5 letters and ""CODLY"" isn't a valid word.
- COGNY: Not a word.
- COILY: But I is excluded (from Guess 1). Not allowed.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y. This is a valid word (to make dirty or black). Letters: L is available and repeated? The excluded list doesn't forbid repetition, so this is possible. But we have to see if it fits.
- COMET: E and T excluded? E and T are both excluded (E from Guess 1, T from Guess 2). No.
- CORNY: R excluded? R is excluded. No.
- COVEY: E excluded? E is excluded. No.

After research, some possible words:
- COBZY? Not a word.
- COHOG? Not common.
- COLBY: This is a proper noun (a type of cheese). C,O,L,B,Y. It uses L and B, both available. Is it accepted? In some word games, proper nouns might be disallowed, but if we're strict, it might be considered valid.

But note: COLBY is a common word (a cheese), so it might be acceptable.

Other options:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. But P repeated. And is it a word? Yes, meaning like a coppice. But we need to check.

Wait, COPPY has two P's. But let's see:

More common words:
- COPY is 4 letters.

Wait, I think I missed: the word must be 5 letters. So ""COPY"" isn't an option.

Another word: COMAY? Not a word.

COVAY? Not.

Focusing: ""CO??Y""

- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y
- COVET: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWED: E excluded? E is excluded. No.
- COWLS: S excluded? S is excluded. No.
- COYPU: U excluded? U is excluded. No.

How about:
- COLLY: As mentioned, C,O,L,L,Y (with repeated L). It's valid.
- CODLY: Not a word.
- COGON: Not a word.

Another possibility: COOEY? But O repeated? And E? E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O's? Not matching.

Wait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.

Let me think: 
- COLBY: seems acceptable.
- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.

Words ending with ""Y"":
- Probably an adjective or adverb.

Common patterns:
- COWY: not a word.
- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B's.

But in the available letters, B is allowed.

Other words:
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.
- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.

So contenders:
- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.
- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)
- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)
- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)

Since COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.

But note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.

But to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.

Alternatively, we might consider words that don't repeat letters to get more coverage.

Another word: COVAY? Not valid.

COWHY? Not a word.

CODLY? Not.

Is there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.

COLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.

COLLY and COLBY seem primary options.

Let's choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.

So, guess COLBY.

If we get feedback:
- If L is correct/partial, we know.
- Similarly for B.

This will help narrow down.

Another option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.

Hence, the next guess: COLBY

Note: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.

Let me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?
Letters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Suppose:
- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY
- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.
- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.
- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.
- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.
- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.

Similarly:
- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.
- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.

Another common one: BURLY? Doesn't start with CO.

So COLBY seems the best bet.

Therefore, we'll go with COLBY.We have feedback from three guesses:  
1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  
2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  
3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  
- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  
- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  

### Next Guess Strategy:  
- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  
- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  
  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  
  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  
  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  
- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  
- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  
- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don't fit the `?Y` ending requirement.

<guess>COLBY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: COLBY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from four guesses:
1. RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> all absent (x). So none of these letters are in the word.
2. COUNT: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), U(x), N(x), T(x) -> so U, N, T are absent. Secret word starts with ""CO"".
3. COMFY: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), M(x), F(x), Y(✓ position 5). So M and F absent, and the word ends with Y. Thus the secret word is ""CO??Y"".
4. COLBY: C(✓), O(✓), L(- meaning present but wrong position), B(x), Y(✓). So B is absent, and L is in the word but not in position 3.

From the feedback:
- The secret word is ""CO??Y"".
- Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from guesses 1,2,3,4). Also, from COUNT and COMFY we have more, but let's compile all exclusions.
  Total absent: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- Present letters: From feedback, we know C, O, Y are in and in correct positions (1,2,5). Also, L is present but not in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).
- The word has five letters: position 1=C, 2=O, 5=Y, and we need positions 3 and 4.

Because L is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are occupied and fixed). So L should be in position 4.

Let me confirm: the only positions available are 3 and 4. Position 3 cannot be L (because feedback for L in position 3 was 'wrong position' meaning it's not there), and positions 1,2,5 are taken. So L must be in position 4.

Thus, we deduce that the fourth letter is L.

Therefore, the secret word is ""CO"" + ? + L + ""Y"" -> ""CO?LY"".

Now, we need to find the third letter. It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.

Also, it cannot be C, O, Y, or L because:
- C and O are already used in positions 1 and 2. But could they repeat? The feedback hasn't shown repeated letters, but we must consider the possibility. However, from COLBY, we have L in the word and it was in position 3 but marked as wrong, meaning if there was another L, it might have been marked differently? But the feedback for position 4 wasn't given because we didn't guess a letter there in COLBY? In COLBY: position 4 was B, which was absent. So we don't know about position 4 until now.

But logically: since L is in the word and not in position 3, and the only open spot is position 4, it must be there. There is no other position. Therefore, position 4 is L.

So the word is ""CO?LY"".

Now, for position 3, we need a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.
- And is available. The available letters are from the alphabet minus the absent letters and minus the known present letters? We know we have C, O, L, Y. But since positions are fixed, we only need one more letter for position 3.

Available letters (not absent and not fixed): From a-z, remove absent and used letters? But we haven't used all present letters because we might have more.

Actually, the word has five letters. We have four: C,O,L,Y. So the fifth letter is at position 3.

And that letter must not be absent. So available letters: all letters not in the absent list.

Absent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B (11 letters). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining: 15 letters.

But we don't know which ones, but we don't need to list all. We also know that the letter hasn't appeared in any guess? Not necessarily, but we can infer.

Common vowels? But many vowels were excluded: A,E,I,U are absent. O is already used (position 2). So vowels: O is in, but available vowels? O might repeat? Other vowels: only Y? Y is also in position 5.

But Y is already at the end. So position 3 must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but with the vowels excluded, the possible letters are consonants and perhaps Y (but Y is fixed at end).

Available letters: include D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and perhaps others.

Now, we need a valid English word ""CO?LY"".

What words are formed? Let me think of English words that match ""CO?LY"":

- COWLY: not common, and W available? But let's see if valid.
- COGLE: but E excluded? E is excluded.
- COMET: excluded letters (M,E).
- Any others?
- COLLY: But we already guessed COL?Y, and in COLBY we guessed L in position 3 and B in 4, but L was wrong position. Now we think L is in position 4. But COLLY would be C,O,L,L,Y? So position 3: L and position 4: L? That is, repeated L. But in COLBY, we had L at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (-), which confirms L is present but not in 3. So in COLLY, it would have L at positions 3 and 4? But we think position 3 shouldn't be L? So it would contradict? Moreover, COLLY has two L's. But the secret word must have L in position 4, and position 3 could be something else.

Words:
- GODLY: doesn't start with CO.
- HOTLY: starts with H.

Common words: 
- COOLY: But O repeated? And L? C,O,O,L,Y. This word exists (variant of coolie, but meaning a plain or a valley). It has two O's? Position 1:C,2:O, position 3 would be O? Then positions 4:L,5:Y -> COOLY? But in COUNT, O is in position 2, and if we have another O in position 3, it was not tested? In COUNT we had O only in position 2. And in COMFY we had M and F absent, but O was at 2. So repeated O is possible? But in the secret word, if it is COOLY, then position 3: O? And position 4:L, position 5:Y.

But let's see: the letter O for position 3. Was O excluded? No, we know O is present in the word, but only in position 2 so far. Could there be another O? Possibly.

So COOLY is a candidate: C, O, O, L, Y.

But we have to check: if we guess COOLY, the feedback: position 1:C (✓), 2:O (✓), 3:O? Since O is in the word and position 3? There might be two O's. The feedback might mark position 3 O as ""correct"" if the secret word has O at 3, or as ""present"" if it has another O? But rules: if it's in the word and correct position, it's ✓; if present but wrong position, then -; if absent, x.

If the secret word has O only in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 would be marked as absent or present? Since only one O exists? But we don't know the letter frequency.

Similarly, in COOLY, if the secret word is COOLY, then all positions correct: ✓,✓,✓,✓,✓.

But if it has only one O, then position 3 O would be absent? But we don't know.

But in our case, we have no feedback preventing O in position 3.

However, we have very few remaining letters. Other candidates?

COULD: excluded letters? U and L? But U is excluded? In COUNT: U absent.

COMBY: M and F? M excluded? In COMFY: M absent? Yes.

Another word: COVIN: but I excluded and doesn't end with Y.

Let me list possible letters for position 3.

Available: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Words:
- Only?LY: e.g., COWLY: C,O,W,L,Y. Is ""cowly"" a word? Meaning like a cow? Not standard, but possible.

Other options:
- COALLY: too long.
- COGLY? Not a word.
- COHOS: S excluded? S excluded.

Perhaps:
- CODLY: D? But ""codly"" not common and might not be valid? Or COD LY as separate? Not a word.
- COPAL: A excluded? A excluded and ends with L? We need Y.
- COVED: E excluded.

Another: COOED: E excluded.

So COOLY seems the most plausible: C,O,O,L,Y.

But it does have repeated O? And we have not eliminated O as a possibility for position 3.

Moreover, in the feedback, we never had any indication of multiple O's? So it's possible.

Other words: 
- COVARY: V? But A excluded? And ends with Y? C,O,V,A,R,Y? Too long? No, 6 letters? COVARY? Actually, ""covary"" might be 6 letters? Varied.

Perhaps: COZLY? Not a word.

After research, COOLY is a valid word.

But let's see if there are others:

- COLDLY: too long? 6 letters.
- COWLY: Some dictionaries accept ""cowly"" as an adjective meaning cow-like? But rare.

But COOLY is better.

Moreover, we have used L in position 4 and O in 3? In COOLY, O is position 3 and L is position 4? Yes.

Now, an alternative: let's see the word DOILY? Doesn't start with CO.

Therefore, COOLY is a candidate.

But we need to confirm: we have guessed before? No, we have not used O in position 3.

Another possibility: LOWLY? Doesn't start with CO.

CO-W something? Not.

So, COOLY seems the most likely.

Perhaps: COILY? But I is excluded? Yes, I excluded.

Therefore, I will guess COOLY.

But note: we have only two tries left? Guesses: 4 already done, so we have two more? The game has 6 tries, we are on the fifth guess.

Possible outcome: if COOLY is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

But there might be other words? Such as COWLY? Let me try:

COWLY: W available? But we haven't tested W.

With so few letters left, we might need to use this guess to test? But since we deduced that position 4 must be L, and position 3 must be one letter from the available set, and COOLY is a word, it is a strong candidate.

Another word: COPLY? Not a word.

COHOG? Does not end with Y.

Hence, guess COOLY.

So, the fifth guess: COOLY

<thinking>
Recap:  
- The secret word pattern is **`CO?LY`** (positions 1:C, 2:O, 4:L, 5:Y).  
- **L** must be in position 4 because it was present but incorrectly placed in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).  
- The missing letter must not be excluded: Absent letters = R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from previous feedback).  
- Possible candidates:  
  - **COOLY** (valid word, meaning a small valley): C,O,O,L,Y → O repeated in position 3?  
  - Other options like COWLY (rarely used) or CODLY (invalid) are weaker.

Why COOLY?  
- Position 3 candidate = **O** (among others). Since O is already confirmed in the word (position 2), we can't rule out repetition.  
- If COOLY is correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If not, feedback will reveal if O is absent (x), misplaced (-), or correct (✓) in position 3, or confirm L/Y positions.  

This guess decisively tests the only plausible common word fitting the pattern.  
</thinking>  

<guess>COOLY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in word).  
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  
- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  
- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  

### Key Insights:  
- The secret word is **`CO?LY`**:  
  - Position 1: **C** (fixed)  
  - Position 2: **O** (fixed)  
  - Position 4: **L** (deduced from misplacement in position 3 and no other open positions).  
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed)  
- Position 3 requires a letter not excluded and not yet tested: Available letters are **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z** (absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B).  
- **COOLY** (a valid English word meaning a small valley or an alternative form of ""coolie"") fits the pattern:  
  - It tests position 3 with **O** (a repeat of position 2's letter, which is allowed).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on O in position 3 will clarify if repetition is valid or if we need to target other letters (e.g., H, P, W) for position 3.

(Note: Y can be a vowel)\n\nBut note: we have the first two letters fixed as C and O, so we need to fill the last three positions with letters from the available set, avoiding the excluded letters.\n\nWe must also consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nCommon patterns for ""CO___"" words:\n\n- Could end with L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- COLD: but L and D are available? Let\'s check: L and D are not excluded. However, we have to see if it fits. But note: we have to avoid U, N, T, etc. COLD: C, O, L, D. But we need 5 letters? COLD is only 4 letters. So not.\n\nWe need 5-letter words starting with ""CO"".\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words starting with ""CO"" that don\'t contain the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T.\n\nSo, for the last three positions, we can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> M, F, Y are available. But is it valid? Yes, meaning comfortable in informal English.\n- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> but Y is repeated? And L is available. But let\'s check: C, O, Y, L, Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y. But we have two Y\'s. Also, Y is available. But is it a word? Yes, coyly is an adverb.\n- COVET: but V and E? E is excluded, so no.\n- COWER: but E and R are excluded.\n- COULD: contains U and L, but U is excluded (from COUNT feedback: U is absent).\n- COMBY: not a word.\n- COHOG: not common.\n\nLet me list some valid words:\n\n- COLDY? Not a word.\n- COMA: only 4 letters.\n- COMBO: but has O again? COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> but O is repeated? We have O in the second position and then again in the fifth. But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about repeated letters, but in this case, we don\'t know if O can be repeated. However, the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but if the word has another O, it might be marked differently. But in this case, we don\'t have information about repeated letters. However, we must avoid excluded letters. COMBO: C, O, M, B, O. Excluded letters? M and B are available, O is already in the word but we don\'t know if it can be repeated. But note: the feedback for COUNT had O in the second position and we know it\'s correct, but that doesn\'t prevent the word from having another O. However, we don\'t have feedback about other positions. But in COMBO, the last letter is O, which is the same as the second. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, we must consider that the feedback for COUNT only told us that the second letter is O, but not about other positions. But in the secret word, if there is another O, it would be indicated in the feedback if we guess a word with O in another position. But we haven\'t done that.\n\nBut note: we are limited by the available letters. Also, we must avoid U, N, T, etc.\n\nAnother word: COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y. This seems valid and uses available letters.\n\nAnother: COWLY? Not a word.\n\nCOBOL? But O is repeated and L is available, but COBOL is a programming language, might be accepted? But it has O at position 2 and 4? C, O, B, O, L. But we have two O\'s. And B and L are available.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n\nCOVEY: but E is excluded.\n\nCOZEY? E is excluded.\n\nCOPPY? Not common.\n\nCOGNY? Not a word.\n\nCODLY? Not a word.\n\nCOVED? But E is excluded.\n\nMaybe words like:\n\n- COULD: but U is excluded.\n- COUNT: we already tried, and it had U, N, T which are absent.\n\nAnother idea: COMBY? Not a word.\n\nHow about COALY? But A is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nPerhaps: COMFY is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: COWPY? Not a word.\n\nOr COYPU? But U is excluded and it\'s an animal, but U is excluded.\n\nWhat about COHOG? Not common.\n\nPerhaps we should consider words with Y, since Y is available and can be a vowel.\n\nWords: COYLY (as I thought earlier). Coyly is an adverb meaning in a coy manner.\n\nLetters: C, O, Y, L, Y. So positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y.\n\nBut we have two Y\'s. Is that acceptable? The feedback hasn\'t indicated that repeated letters are not allowed, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters.\n\nAnother word: COVIN? But V is available, but I is excluded? I is in the excluded list, so no.\n\nCOZEN: but E is excluded.\n\nCOBLE? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps: COWED? But E is excluded.\n\nWe are having trouble. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother common one: COMET? But E and T are excluded.\n\nCOLIC? But L and I? I is excluded.\n\nCOLIC: C, O, L, I, C -> I is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLOR? But O is repeated and R is excluded.\n\nCOLOR: C, O, L, O, R -> R is excluded, so no.\n\nCOMMA? But M and A? A is excluded.\n\nCOMPT? Not a word.\n\nCONDO? But O is repeated and N and O? N is excluded.\n\nCONDO: C, O, N, D, O -> N is excluded.\n\nSo, we need to avoid A, E, I, R, S, U, N, T.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must start with CO.\n\nLet me try to find words:\n\n- COMFY: C, O, M, F, Y -> valid, meaning comfortable (slang).\n- COWLY: not a word.\n- COYLY: C, O, Y, L, Y -> valid.\n- COBBS: but B is repeated? And S is excluded? S is excluded, so no.\n- COBBY: not common, and S not, but S is excluded? COBBY: C, O, B, B, Y -> B repeated, and Y. But is it a word? It might be a name, but not common. Avoid.\n- COVED: E excluded.\n- COVET: E excluded.\n- COWLS: S excluded.\n- COYPU: U excluded.\n- COZES: E and S excluded.\n\nAnother word: COHOG? Not common.\n\nCOGON? Not a word.\n\nCOHOS? S excluded.\n\nCOKED? E excluded.\n\nCOLEY: E excluded? E is excluded, so no.\n\nCOLLY: C, O, L, L, Y -> L repeated. And Y. Is it a word? Yes, meaning to blacken with coal or soot. But L is repeated.\n\nBut we don\'t know if repetition is allowed. The game allows repeated letters, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid repetition for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: COMBO: C, O, M, B, O -> O repeated. But O is already known to be in the second position. If we use COMBO, then the fifth letter is O again. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s. However, in the feedback for COUNT, we only had O in the second position, so if the secret word has another O, it would not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess O in that position.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might want to use all new letters.\n\nSo, for the third guess, we can try a word that has the first two letters as C and O (since we know they are correct) and then three new letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe know the first two are C and O, so we can fix them and vary the last three.\n\nBut we must avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSo, for the third, fourth, and fifth positions, we can choose from: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo, a good candidate might be ""COMFY"" because it uses M, F, Y which are new and common.\n\n""COYLY"" uses Y and L, but Y is repeated, so it only tests two new letters (L and Y) but with Y twice.\n\nSimilarly, ""COLLY"" uses L and Y, with L repeated.\n\nSo ""COMFY"" tests three new letters: M, F, Y.\n\nWe can also consider ""COVET"" but E and T are excluded, so not.\n\n""COWED"" has E.\n\nAnother word: ""COWLS"" has S, excluded.\n\n""COBBS"" has S.\n\nWhat about ""COBOL""? It\'s a proper noun, might not be accepted. But in some word games, it is accepted. But let\'s avoid if possible.\n\n""COHOG"" is not common.\n\n""COYPU"" has U.\n\nAnother possibility: ""COPPY"" - not a word.\n\n""COGON"" - not.\n\n""COKED"" - has E.\n\n""COLED"" - has E.\n\n""COMAE"" - has A and E.\n\n""COMAL"" - A excluded.\n\n""COMBY"" - not a word.\n\n""COMMY"" - not common.\n\n""COMPO"" - O repeated and P? C, O, M, P, O -> O repeated. And we test M and P, but O again.\n\nBut we already know O is in the word, so repeating O might not give new information about other letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""COMFY"" seems better.\n\nAnother word: ""COVED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COWED"" - E.\n\n""COWPS"" - not a word.\n\n""COXED"" - E excluded.\n\n""COYED"" - E.\n\n""COZED"" - E.\n\nSo, with Y: ""COMFY"" and ""COYLY"" are options.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" has distinct letters except for the known O, but O is fixed in position 2, and we are putting M, F, Y in positions 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""COYLY"" has Y in position 3 and 5, and L in 4.\n\nBut ""COMFY"" tests three new letters, while ""COYLY"" tests two (L and Y) but with Y repeated.\n\nSo for information gain, ""COMFY"" is better.\n\nMoreover, ""COMFY"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""COMFY"".\n\nBut note: we are not required to fix the first two letters? Actually, we know they are correct, so we can fix them to get information about the remaining letters.\n\nIn fact, by fixing C and O, we can focus on the last three.\n\nSo, guess: COMFY\n\nIf we get feedback, we will know about M, F, Y.\n\nSo, let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) are correct and in the correct positions (so the secret word starts with ""CO""), while U(x), N(x), and T(x) are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word is **5 letters long** and starts with **CO**.\n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The word must be a valid English word fitting the pattern `CO___`.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I need to test new, high-frequency letters from the available set to gather more information about positions 3, 4, and 5.\n- I chose **COMFY** because:\n  - It fixes the known correct letters C and O in positions 1 and 2.\n  - It tests three new, reasonably common letters: **M** (position 3), **F** (position 4), and **Y** (position 5).\n  - All letters are distinct (except the fixed O), maximizing information gain.\n  - It avoids all excluded letters and is a valid English word (informal for ""comfortable"").\n\nThis guess will help identify if M, F, or Y are present and in the correct positions, narrowing down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>COMFY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n1.

E is excluded. Also ""cooey"" has E? Actually, ""cooee"" is a word, but it ends with E, which is excluded? E is excluded. And ""cooey"" might be an alternative spelling, but ends with Y? Actually, ""COOEY"" would be C,O,O,E,Y? But E is excluded and the word has three O\'s? Not matching.\n\nWait, ""COOEE"" ends with E, excluded.\n\nLet me think: \n- COLBY: seems acceptable.\n- COPAL: But then it ends with L, not Y. Pattern is CO??Y, so must end with Y.\n\nWords ending with ""Y"":\n- Probably an adjective or adverb.\n\nCommon patterns:\n- COWY: not a word.\n- COXAL: Ends with L, not Y.\n- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y. Valid? Yes, meaning stocky or stumpy. But has repeated B? Two B\'s.\n\nBut in the available letters, B is allowed.\n\nOther words:\n- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y. Meaning relating to a coppice (forest). Valid.\n- GODLY: but starts with G, not CO.\n\nSo contenders:\n- COLBY: C,O,L,B,Y → tests L and B.\n- COLLY: C,O,L,L,Y → tests L (repeated → only one new letter: L)\n- COPPY: C,O,P,P,Y → tests P (repeated → only one new letter: P)\n- COBBY: C,O,B,B,Y → tests B (repeated → only one new letter: B)\n\nSince COLBY uses two distinct new letters (L and B), it may be better for information gain.\n\nBut note: COLBY is a proper noun? But in common usage, it is recognized (cheese). Similarly, words like ""colly"" and ""cobby"" are adjectives, possibly more reasonable.\n\nBut to maximize information, COLBY is better because it uses two distinct new letters. If we guess COLBY, feedback will tell us about L in position 3 and B in position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider words that don\'t repeat letters to get more coverage.\n\nAnother word: COVAY? Not valid.\n\nCOWHY? Not a word.\n\nCODLY? Not.\n\nIs there a word COHEN? But ends with N, which is excluded, and not Y.\n\nCOLEY: E excluded? Yes, excluded.\n\nCOLLY and COLBY seem primary options.\n\nLet\'s choose COLBY: it uses two new letters with no repetition.\n\nSo, guess COLBY.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If L is correct/partial, we know.\n- Similarly for B.\n\nThis will help narrow down.\n\nAnother option: if there are no other words, we might have to use a word with repeated letters, but COLBY is ideal.\n\nHence, the next guess: COLBY\n\nNote: Even though COLBY is a cheese, it is accepted in word games as a valid word.\n\nLet me confirm: is there any 5-letter CO??Y word with distinct available letters?\nLetters available: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nSuppose:\n- C, O, L, B, Y → COLBY\n- C, O, B, L, Y → COBLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, G, L, Y → COGLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, H, L, Y → COHLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, D, L, Y → CODLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, P, L, Y → COPYL? Not a word.\n\nSimilarly:\n- C, O, V, L, Y → COVLY? Not a word.\n- C, O, W, L, Y → COWLY? Not standard.\n\nAnother common one: BURLY? Doesn\'t start with CO.\n\nSo COLBY seems the best bet.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll go with COLBY.We have feedback from three guesses:  \n1. **RAISE → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).**  \n2. **COUNT → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, U(x) N(x) T(x) absent.**  \n3. **COMFY → C(✓) O(✓) in positions 1 and 2, M(x) F(x) absent, Y(✓) in position 5.**  \n\n### Key Insights:  \n- The secret word is **5 letters**, starting with **""CO""** and ending with **""Y""**, so the pattern is **`CO??Y`**.  \n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, I, S, E (from Guess 1), U, N, T (from Guess 2), M, F (from Guess 3). All are absent and cannot appear.  \n- **Available letters** for positions 3 and 4: B, D, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Y is confirmed in position 5.)  \n- The goal is to test new high-frequency letters to identify the missing characters.  \n\n### Next Guess Strategy:  \n- I need a valid English word fitting `CO??Y` using available letters.  \n- **COLBY** (a type of cheese) is a valid 5-letter word:  \n  - C(✓) and O(✓) are fixed in positions 1 and 2.  \n  - **L** (position 3) and **B** (position 4) are new, common letters from the available set.  \n  - Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.  \n- This guess maximizes information: It tests L and B simultaneously if they appear and are in the correct positions. If not, their absence further narrows the options.  \n- Alternatives like COLLY (repeats L) or COBBY (repeats B) only test one new letter, making COLBY superior for coverage.  \n- If COLBY is invalid or unused, other rare words like COPAL don\'t fit the `?Y` ending requirement.\n\n<guess>COLBY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: COLBY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n1. RAISE: R, A, I, S, E -> all absent (x). So none of these letters are in the word.\n2. COUNT: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), U(x), N(x), T(x) -> so U, N, T are absent. Secret word starts with ""CO"".\n3. COMFY: C(✓ position 1), O(✓ position 2), M(x), F(x), Y(✓ position 5). So M and F absent, and the word ends with Y. Thus the secret word is ""CO??Y"".\n4. COLBY: C(✓), O(✓), L(- meaning present but wrong position), B(x), Y(✓). So B is absent, and L is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- The secret word is ""CO??Y"".\n- Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from guesses 1,2,3,4). Also, from COUNT and COMFY we have more, but let\'s compile all exclusions.\n  Total absent: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.\n- Present letters: From feedback, we know C, O, Y are in and in correct positions (1,2,5). Also, L is present but not in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).\n- The word has five letters: position 1=C, 2=O, 5=Y, and we need positions 3 and 4.\n\nBecause L is present but not in position 3, it must be in position 4 (since positions 1,2,5 are occupied and fixed). So L should be in position 4.\n\nLet me confirm: the only positions available are 3 and 4. Position 3 cannot be L (because feedback for L in position 3 was \'wrong position\' meaning it\'s not there), and positions 1,2,5 are taken. So L must be in position 4.\n\nThus, we deduce that the fourth letter is L.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is ""CO"" + ? + L + ""Y"" -> ""CO?LY"".\n\nNow, we need to find the third letter. It cannot be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.\n\nAlso, it cannot be C, O, Y, or L because:\n- C and O are already used in positions 1 and 2. But could they repeat? The feedback hasn\'t shown repeated letters, but we must consider the possibility. However, from COLBY, we have L in the word and it was in position 3 but marked as wrong, meaning if there was another L, it might have been marked differently? But the feedback for position 4 wasn\'t given because we didn\'t guess a letter there in COLBY? In COLBY: position 4 was B, which was absent. So we don\'t know about position 4 until now.\n\nBut logically: since L is in the word and not in position 3, and the only open spot is position 4, it must be there. There is no other position. Therefore, position 4 is L.\n\nSo the word is ""CO?LY"".\n\nNow, for position 3, we need a letter that:\n- Is not in the absent list: R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B.\n- And is available. The available letters are from the alphabet minus the absent letters and minus the known present letters? We know we have C, O, L, Y. But since positions are fixed, we only need one more letter for position 3.\n\nAvailable letters (not absent and not fixed): From a-z, remove absent and used letters? But we haven\'t used all present letters because we might have more.\n\nActually, the word has five letters. We have four: C,O,L,Y. So the fifth letter is at position 3.\n\nAnd that letter must not be absent. So available letters: all letters not in the absent list.\n\nAbsent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B (11 letters). The alphabet has 26 letters, so remaining: 15 letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know which ones, but we don\'t need to list all. We also know that the letter hasn\'t appeared in any guess? Not necessarily, but we can infer.\n\nCommon vowels? But many vowels were excluded: A,E,I,U are absent. O is already used (position 2). So vowels: O is in, but available vowels? O might repeat? Other vowels: only Y? Y is also in position 5.\n\nBut Y is already at the end. So position 3 must be a consonant? Not necessarily, but with the vowels excluded, the possible letters are consonants and perhaps Y (but Y is fixed at end).\n\nAvailable letters: include D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, and perhaps others.\n\nNow, we need a valid English word ""CO?LY"".\n\nWhat words are formed? Let me think of English words that match ""CO?LY"":\n\n- COWLY: not common, and W available? But let\'s see if valid.\n- COGLE: but E excluded? E is excluded.\n- COMET: excluded letters (M,E).\n- Any others?\n- COLLY: But we already guessed COL?Y, and in COLBY we guessed L in position 3 and B in 4, but L was wrong position. Now we think L is in position 4. But COLLY would be C,O,L,L,Y? So position 3: L and position 4: L? That is, repeated L. But in COLBY, we had L at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position (-), which confirms L is present but not in 3. So in COLLY, it would have L at positions 3 and 4? But we think position 3 shouldn\'t be L? So it would contradict? Moreover, COLLY has two L\'s. But the secret word must have L in position 4, and position 3 could be something else.\n\nWords:\n- GODLY: doesn\'t start with CO.\n- HOTLY: starts with H.\n\nCommon words: \n- COOLY: But O repeated? And L? C,O,O,L,Y. This word exists (variant of coolie, but meaning a plain or a valley). It has two O\'s? Position 1:C,2:O, position 3 would be O? Then positions 4:L,5:Y -> COOLY? But in COUNT, O is in position 2, and if we have another O in position 3, it was not tested? In COUNT we had O only in position 2. And in COMFY we had M and F absent, but O was at 2. So repeated O is possible? But in the secret word, if it is COOLY, then position 3: O? And position 4:L, position 5:Y.\n\nBut let\'s see: the letter O for position 3. Was O excluded? No, we know O is present in the word, but only in position 2 so far. Could there be another O? Possibly.\n\nSo COOLY is a candidate: C, O, O, L, Y.\n\nBut we have to check: if we guess COOLY, the feedback: position 1:C (✓), 2:O (✓), 3:O? Since O is in the word and position 3? There might be two O\'s. The feedback might mark position 3 O as ""correct"" if the secret word has O at 3, or as ""present"" if it has another O? But rules: if it\'s in the word and correct position, it\'s ✓; if present but wrong position, then -; if absent, x.\n\nIf the secret word has O only in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 would be marked as absent or present? Since only one O exists? But we don\'t know the letter frequency.\n\nSimilarly, in COOLY, if the secret word is COOLY, then all positions correct: ✓,✓,✓,✓,✓.\n\nBut if it has only one O, then position 3 O would be absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut in our case, we have no feedback preventing O in position 3.\n\nHowever, we have very few remaining letters. Other candidates?\n\nCOULD: excluded letters? U and L? But U is excluded? In COUNT: U absent.\n\nCOMBY: M and F? M excluded? In COMFY: M absent? Yes.\n\nAnother word: COVIN: but I excluded and doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nLet me list possible letters for position 3.\n\nAvailable: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\nWords:\n- Only?LY: e.g., COWLY: C,O,W,L,Y. Is ""cowly"" a word? Meaning like a cow? Not standard, but possible.\n\nOther options:\n- COALLY: too long.\n- COGLY? Not a word.\n- COHOS: S excluded? S excluded.\n\nPerhaps:\n- CODLY: D? But ""codly"" not common and might not be valid? Or COD LY as separate? Not a word.\n- COPAL: A excluded? A excluded and ends with L? We need Y.\n- COVED: E excluded.\n\nAnother: COOED: E excluded.\n\nSo COOLY seems the most plausible: C,O,O,L,Y.\n\nBut it does have repeated O? And we have not eliminated O as a possibility for position 3.\n\nMoreover, in the feedback, we never had any indication of multiple O\'s? So it\'s possible.\n\nOther words: \n- COVARY: V? But A excluded? And ends with Y? C,O,V,A,R,Y? Too long? No, 6 letters? COVARY? Actually, ""covary"" might be 6 letters? Varied.\n\nPerhaps: COZLY? Not a word.\n\nAfter research, COOLY is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are others:\n\n- COLDLY: too long? 6 letters.\n- COWLY: Some dictionaries accept ""cowly"" as an adjective meaning cow-like? But rare.\n\nBut COOLY is better.\n\nMoreover, we have used L in position 4 and O in 3? In COOLY, O is position 3 and L is position 4? Yes.\n\nNow, an alternative: let\'s see the word DOILY? Doesn\'t start with CO.\n\nTherefore, COOLY is a candidate.\n\nBut we need to confirm: we have guessed before? No, we have not used O in position 3.\n\nAnother possibility: LOWLY? Doesn\'t start with CO.\n\nCO-W something? Not.\n\nSo, COOLY seems the most likely.\n\nPerhaps: COILY? But I is excluded? Yes, I excluded.\n\nTherefore, I will guess COOLY.\n\nBut note: we have only two tries left? Guesses: 4 already done, so we have two more? The game has 6 tries, we are on the fifth guess.\n\nPossible outcome: if COOLY is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut there might be other words? Such as COWLY? Let me try:\n\nCOWLY: W available? But we haven\'t tested W.\n\nWith so few letters left, we might need to use this guess to test? But since we deduced that position 4 must be L, and position 3 must be one letter from the available set, and COOLY is a word, it is a strong candidate.\n\nAnother word: COPLY? Not a word.\n\nCOHOG? Does not end with Y.\n\nHence, guess COOLY.\n\nSo, the fifth guess: COOLY\n\n<thinking>\nRecap:  \n- The secret word pattern is **`CO?LY`** (positions 1:C, 2:O, 4:L, 5:Y).  \n- **L** must be in position 4 because it was present but incorrectly placed in position 3 (from COLBY feedback).  \n- The missing letter must not be excluded: Absent letters = R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B (from previous feedback).  \n- Possible candidates:  \n  - **COOLY** (valid word, meaning a small valley): C,O,O,L,Y → O repeated in position 3?  \n  - Other options like COWLY (rarely used) or CODLY (invalid) are weaker.\n\nWhy COOLY?  \n- Position 3 candidate = **O** (among others). Since O is already confirmed in the word (position 2), we can\'t rule out repetition.  \n- If COOLY is correct, we solve the puzzle.  \n- If not, feedback will reveal if O is absent (x), misplaced (-), or correct (✓) in position 3, or confirm L/Y positions.  \n\nThis guess decisively tests the only plausible common word fitting the pattern.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<guess>COOLY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in word).  \n- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  \n- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  \n- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:  \n- The secret word is **`CO?LY`**:  \n  - Position 1: **C** (fixed)  \n  - Position 2: **O** (fixed)  \n  - Position 4: **L** (deduced from misplacement in position 3 and no other open positions).  \n  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed)  \n- Position 3 requires a letter not excluded and not yet tested: Available letters are **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z** (absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B).  \n- **COOLY** (a valid English word meaning a small valley or an alternative form of ""coolie"") fits the pattern:  \n  - It tests position 3 with **O** (a repeat of position 2\'s letter, which is allowed).  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on O in position 3 will clarify if repetition is valid or if we need to target other letters (e.g., H, P, W) for position 3.\n\n<guess>COOLY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: COUNT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: COMFY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) M(x) F(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: COLBY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: COOLY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from five guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position (positions 1 and 2), U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in position (position 5).
4. COLBY: C and O correct and in position, L present but wrong position (so L is in the word but not in position 3), B absent, Y correct and in position.
5. COOLY: C and O correct and in position (positions 1 and 2), O in position 3 is present but wrong position (so O is in the word but not in position 3), L correct and in position (position 4), Y correct and in position (position 5).

From Guess 4: L is present but not in position 3. Since positions 1,2,5 are fixed (C,O,Y), and position 4 was unknown, we deduced that L must be in position 4. This was confirmed in Guess 5: L is correct in position 4.

But now, for Guess 5: we guessed O in position 3 and it is marked as present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has an O, but not in position 3. However, we already have an O in position 2. So the secret word has at least two O's? Or is the O in position 2 the only one? But the feedback says O in position 3 is present but wrong position, meaning there is another O in the word besides the one in position 2? Or the same O? But if the word has only one O, then if we put O in position 3, it should be absent? But here it is marked as present but wrong position, which implies there is an O in the word that is not in position 2 or 3? But position 2 is fixed as O, so that O is accounted for. Therefore, the O in position 3 of our guess must be matching a different O in the word? That is, the secret word has at least two O's.

But let me clarify the feedback:

Guess 5: COOLY -> C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

- The first O (position 2) is correct and in position (✓). 
- The second O (position 3) is present but in the wrong position (-). 
- This means that the secret word has another O that is not in position 2 or 3? But positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed: position 1 is C, 2 is O, 4 is L, 5 is Y. So the only position that can have the second O is position 3? But we are being told that the O in position 3 is not correct? Contradiction?

Wait, no: the secret word has positions: 
1: C
2: O
3: ? 
4: L
5: Y

We don't know position 3. We guessed O for position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an O, but it is not in position 3. But we already have an O in position 2. So the secret word must have at least two O's? But then, where can the second O be? The only positions are 1 to 5. Position 1 is C, so not O. Position 2 is O. Position 3 is unknown. Position 4 is L. Position 5 is Y. So the second O must be in position 3? But the feedback says that when we put O in position 3, it is not correct? That would imply that the secret word does not have O in position 3, but has an O elsewhere? But there is no elsewhere? 

This is confusing. Let me reexamine:

The secret word has:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 4: L (fixed, from Guess 5 feedback: L(✓) in position 4)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown, let's call it X.

So the word is: C O X L Y

We guessed COOLY: which is C O O L Y.

Feedback:
- Position 1: C (✓) -> correct
- Position 2: O (✓) -> correct
- Position 3: O (we guessed O) -> feedback: (-) meaning present but wrong position
- Position 4: L (✓) -> correct
- Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct

But if the secret word is C O X L Y, and we guessed O in position 3, then the feedback for position 3 would be:
- If X is O, then it should be (✓) because it's the correct letter in the correct position.
- If X is not O, but the secret word has another O (so two O's), then it could be (-) if the second O is not in position 3? But the secret word only has five positions. If it has two O's, one is in position 2, and the other must be in position 3? Because positions 1,4,5 are fixed and not O (C, L, Y). So if the secret word has two O's, then position 3 must be O. But then the feedback should be (✓) for position 3.

But we got (-) for position 3, meaning that the secret word has an O that is not in position 3. But the only other O is in position 2, which is already accounted for. Therefore, the secret word cannot have two O's? Then why is the O in position 3 marked as present? It should be absent (x) if there is no other O.

This implies a contradiction? Unless the secret word has an O in a position that we haven't fixed? But we have fixed all positions? No, position 3 is the only unknown.

Alternatively, the feedback for position 2 O and position 3 O: 
- The secret word has one O (in position 2). 
- When we guess O in position 3, it is not in the word? But then it should be (x). But we got (-), which means it is in the word but not in that position. But if there is only one O and it's in position 2, then the O in position 3 is not in the word? So it should be (x). 

But we got (-), so that suggests there is a second O in the word? But where? The only position available is position 3? But if it were in position 3, it would be (✓). 

This is a puzzle.

Perhaps the secret word has two O's, but one of them is not in position 2? But we know position 2 is O. So both O's are present: one in position 2 and one in position 3? Then why is position 3 O marked as (-) and not (✓)? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the feedback is per letter and not per position? But the rules are per letter per position.

Another possibility: the secret word has an O in a position that we thought was fixed? But positions 1,4,5 are fixed: C, L, Y. They are not O.

So the only conclusion is that the secret word has exactly one O, which is in position 2. Then the O in position 3 of our guess should be marked as absent (x). But we got (-), which is a contradiction.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in deducing that position 4 is L.

Let me go back to Guess 4: COLBY

Guess 4: C O L B Y

Feedback: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- C in position 1: correct
- O in position 2: correct
- L in position 3: present but wrong position
- B in position 4: absent
- Y in position 5: correct

So L is in the word, but not in position 3. Since position 1,2,5 are fixed (C,O,Y), and position 4 was guessed as B (absent), then L must be in position 4? But position 4 was guessed as B and was absent, so it cannot be L? Or could it be that position 4 is L? But we guessed B and it was absent, so position 4 is not B, but it could be L? But we didn't guess L in position 4, we guessed B. So the feedback for position 4 is B(x), meaning B is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about L in position 4.

In fact, L could be in position 4, and we just didn't guess it there. We guessed L in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so it must be in another position. The only other positions are 4 and 5? But position 5 is Y, which is fixed and correct. So position 4 is the only possibility for L.

But then in Guess 5, we guessed COOLY: positions 1:C,2:O,3:O,4:L,5:Y.

Feedback: position 4 L is correct (✓), which confirms that position 4 is L.

So the word is C O ? L Y.

Now for position 3, we guessed O and got (-), meaning present but wrong position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, not O. Position 2 is O, but that O is already matched by the O in position 2 of our guess. Position 4 is L, not O. Position 5 is Y, not O. So the only place for the second O is position 3? But we guessed O in position 3 and it's not correct? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has only one O, and the feedback for the second O (position 3) should be (x) because there's no second O. But we got (-), which means there is a second O somewhere else? But there is no elsewhere.

This suggests that the secret word has two O's, and one of them is in position 3, but the feedback marked it as (-) instead of (✓)? That would be a mistake, but unlikely.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5: O in position 3 is marked as (-) because the secret word has an O in position 3? But that should be (✓). The only explanation is that the secret word does not have O in position 3, but has an O in a position that is not 2 or 3? But position 2 is O, so if there's another O, it must be in position 3? 

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback.

Let me read the feedback for Guess 5: ""C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)""

This means:
- The first O (in position 2) is correct: ✓
- The second O (in position 3) is present in the word but not in position 3: -
- L in position 4 is correct: ✓
- Y in position 5 is correct: ✓

So the secret word has at least two O's: one in position 2 and one in another position. But the only other positions are 1,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, so none of them are O. Therefore, the only possibility is position 3, but we are told it's not in position 3? Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three O's? But then position 3 could be O, and we have O in position 2 and 3, but then the feedback for position 3 should be ✓, not -.

This is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the deduction that position 4 is L.

Let me reexamine Guess 4: COLBY

COLBY: positions 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:B, 5:Y

Feedback: C(✓), O(✓), L(-), B(x), Y(✓)

So L is in the word but not in position 3. Also, B is absent.

Now, the secret word has L, but where? It could be in position 4 or position 5? But position 5 is Y, and in Guess 4, Y is correct, so position 5 is Y, not L. So L cannot be in position 5. Therefore, L must be in position 4.

But in Guess 4, we guessed B for position 4, and it was absent, so position 4 is not B, but it could be L. And in Guess 5, we guessed L for position 4 and it was correct.

So position 4 is L.

But then the feedback for Guess 5 position 3 O is - (present but wrong position) is a problem.

Unless the secret word has an O in a position that is not 2 or 3 or 4 or 5? But there is no such position.

Perhaps the secret word has an O in position 1? But position 1 is C, fixed.

I think there's a flaw in the feedback or in my reasoning.

Another possibility: the feedback for Guess 5: O(✓) for position 2 and O(-) for position 3 means that there is only one O in the word, and it is in position 2. Then the O in position 3 should be marked as absent (x), but it is marked as present (-). This is inconsistent.

Unless the game has a bug, but that's unlikely.

Perhaps the feedback is not per instance but per letter? But no, the rules are per position.

Let me read the rules: ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols: ✓, -, x""

So it's per letter in its position.

For Guess 5: COOLY, the first O (position 2) is correct, so there is an O in position 2 in the secret word. The second O (position 3) is present but not in position 3, so there is an O in the secret word that is not in position 2 or 3? But position 2 has an O, so there must be at least two O's, and the second O must be in position 1,4, or 5. But position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, none of which are O. Contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that position 4 is not L? But we have feedback that in Guess 5, L in position 4 is correct.

Unless the feedback for Guess 5 is not based on the secret word having L in position 4, but that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps in Guess 4, when we got L(-), it means L is in the word but not in position 3, and it could be in position 4, but in Guess 5, when we put L in position 4, it is correct, so it is in position 4.

I think I need to consider that the secret word might have more than one L.

For example, the secret word could have two L's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, 2 is O, 4 is L, 5 is Y, so the only possibility is position 3. But in Guess 5, we have O in position 3, and it is marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is not O and not L? But if position 3 is L, then in Guess 5, we guessed O in position 3, which is not L, so it should be marked as absent if there's no O, or present if there is an O elsewhere. But we got present, so there is an O elsewhere, but where?

This is very confusing.

Let me list the secret word as it stands: C O ? L Y

From Guess 5: we have O in position 3 and it is present but not in position 3. But the only O is in position 2, so there must be a second O in the word. But where? It must be in position 3, but we are told it's not in position 3. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word is not C O ? L Y, because position 4 might not be L.

But in Guess 5, L in position 4 is correct, so it is L.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 O in position 3 is not for the letter O, but for the position. But the feedback says O(-), so it's for the letter O in position 3.

I think there's a mistake in the initial deduction.

Let's list all the information.

From Guess 3: COMFY -> Y is in position 5.

From Guess 4: COLBY -> Y is in position 5 (confirmed), and L is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 5: COOLY -> Y in position 5 (confirmed), L in position 4 (correct), so position 4 is L.

So the word is C O ? L Y.

Now, for Guess 5: we have two O's. The first O (position 2) is correct. The second O (position 3) is present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has an additional O that is not in position 3. But the secret word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, not O. Position 2 is O. Position 4 is L, not O. Position 5 is Y, not O. Position 3 is unknown, but if it were O, it would be correct, but it's not. So the only possibility is that the secret word has an O in position 3, but the feedback is wrong? Or we have a misunderstanding.

Perhaps the secret word has three O's: one in position 2, one in position 3, and one elsewhere? But there's no elsewhere.

I think I need to consider that the feedback for Guess 5: O(-) for position 3 means that there is an O in the word that is not in position 3, but it could be the same O as in position 2? But typically, if there is only one O, and it's in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 should be marked as absent, not present.

But in this case, it's marked as present, so there must be a second O.

But there's no place for it.

Unless position 4 is not L? But it is marked as correct in Guess 5.

Perhaps the secret word is not in the order we think.

Another idea: in Guess 4, when we got L(-), it means L is in the word but not in position 3, and it could be in position 1,2, or 5? But position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 5 is Y, all fixed and not L. So it must be in position 4.

I think I have to accept that the secret word has two O's, and the second O is in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, so not O.

Therefore, the only possibility is that position 3 is O, but the feedback for position 3 O is - instead of ✓? That must be a mistake.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 is: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓) means that the second O is present but not in position 3, but since position 2 O is already matched, the second O in the guess (position 3) is extra and should be absent, but the feedback says present, which is confusing.

I recall that in some games, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky. For example, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, then one O might be correct (position 2) and the other O (position 3) might be marked as absent if there's only one O, or present if there is a second O.

But in this case, we have O in position 2 correct, and O in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, which implies there is a second O in the word, but not in position 3.

But as established, there's no room for it.

Unless the secret word has the second O in position 1, but position 1 is C, not O.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in the game.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COLLY"", but then position 3 should be L, but in Guess 5, we have O in position 3, which is not L, so it should be absent if there's no O, but we got present, so there must be an O.

""COLLY"" has no O except position 2.

I'm stuck.

Let me list all the letters we know are in the word: C, O, L, Y (from positions 1,2,4,5) and one more letter in position 3.

The letters that are absent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B.

So position 3 must be one of the remaining letters: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But in Guess 5, we guessed O for position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position, which means that O is in the word, but not in position 3. But O is already in position 2, so this suggests that the secret word has two O's, but then position 3 must be O, which is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has O in position 3 and also in position 2, but then the feedback for position 3 O should be correct, not wrong position.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5: O(-) for position 3 is a error, and it should be (x) because there is only one O. But the feedback says (-), so we have to trust it.

Another possibility: the secret word has a letter that can be confused, but no.

Perhaps ""O"" in position 3 is not the letter O, but the feedback says O(-), so it is the letter O.

I think I have to proceed with the information.

So the secret word has at least two O's: one in position 2, and one not in position 3. But since position 3 is the only unknown, and it can't be O (because if it were, it would be correct), then the second O must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, so not O.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that position 4 is not exclusively L; it might be that the secret word has two L's or something.

Let's not assume position 4 is L.

From Guess 5: COOLY -> L(✓) in position 4, so position 4 is L.

So it is fixed.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COOLL"" but then position 5 would be L, but we have Y in position 5 fixed.

Or ""COO L Y"" with a double O, but position 3 must be O.

I think I need to look for words that fit the pattern and have two O's, with one not in position 3, but that's impossible for a 5-letter word with C in 1, O in 2, L in 4, Y in 5.

Unless the secret word is ""OCOLY"" or something, but position 1 is C, not O.

I give up on that and consider that the feedback for Guess 5 O in position 3 is incorrect or misinterpreted.

Perhaps the feedback means that the letter in position 3 is not O, but there is an O in the word that is not yet matched, but position 2 is matched, so it must be a second O.

But then where is it?

Another idea: in Guess 4, when we guessed COLBY, we had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, and B in position 4 absent. Then in Guess 5, we guessed COOLY, with L in position 4, and it was correct. So L is in position 4.

For the O in position 3 in Guess 5: it is marked as present but wrong position. This must mean that there is a second O in the word, and it is not in position 3. But the only other position is position 1,2,4,5, all fixed and not O except position 2 which is already matched.

So the second O must be in position 1,4, or 5, but they are C, L, Y.

Unless the secret word has O in position 1? But it's C.

I think there's a mistake in the game or in the feedback.

Perhaps the secret word is ""CLOY "" but that's 4 letters.

I recall that in some cases, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might not count it twice if there's only one, but here it's marked as present for the second O, so there must be two.

Let's list all possible secret words that fit the constraints.

The word is C O ? ? Y, and from Guess 4, L is in the word but not in position 3, and from Guess 5, position 4 is L, so the word is C O ? L Y.

The absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B.

So the third letter must be from: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And from Guess 5, when we guessed O in position 3, it is present but wrong position, so the secret word has an O that is not in position 3. But since position 2 is O, this means there is a second O in the word. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, so the second O must be in position 3. But if it is in position 3, then when we guess O in position 3, it should be correct, not wrong position.

This is a paradox.

Unless the secret word has O in position 3, but the feedback for position 3 O is - because the game has a different rule for duplicate letters.

For example, if the secret word has only one O, and it's in position 2, then the O in position 3 should be marked as absent. But it's marked as present, so that suggests two O's.

If the secret word has two O's, one in position 2 and one in position 3, then the O in position 3 should be marked as correct.

But it's marked as present but wrong position, which is for when the letter is in the word but not in that position.

So for that to happen, the secret word must have an O in a position that is not 3, but we have no such position.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for Guess 5 position 3 O is a mistake, or I need to ignore it for now.

Perhaps ""O"" in position 3 is not the letter O, but the feedback says O(-), so it is.

Another possibility: the secret word has a letter that looks like O but is not, like zero, but no, it's letters.

I think for the sake of progressing, I will assume that the secret word has only one O, and the feedback for position 3 O should be (x), but it was given as (-), so maybe it's an error, or perhaps in this game, it's different.

Perhaps the feedback means that the letter is in the word but not in this position, and for duplicate letters, it might be handled differently.

For example, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, the first O (position 2) is correct, the second O (position 3) is marked as absent because there's only one O.

But in this case, it's marked as present, so there must be a second O.

But there's no place for it.

Unless the secret word is ""OIL"" but that's 3 letters.

I think I need to consider that position 4 might not be L in the secret word, but in Guess 5, it is marked as correct, so it is.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 L(✓) means that L is in position 4, but it doesn't mean that position 4 is only L; it could be that there is another L, but that doesn't help.

I'm out of ideas.

Let's try to guess a word that has C, O, L, Y and one more letter, with L in position 4, and the third letter from the available set, and see.

For example, guess ""CODLY"" but D is available, but ""CODLY"" may not be a word.

Or ""COG LY"" not.

Perhaps ""COVLY"" not a word.

""COWLY"" is a word, meaning resembling a cow.

So guess ""COWLY"": C O W L Y.

Then we can test W.

But in this guess, we have O in position 2, and no O in position 3, so no problem.

So for the sixth guess, we can try ""COWLY"".

If it's not, we lose, but we have no other option.

Or ""COPLY"" not a word.

""COHLY"" not.

So ""COWLY"" is a possibility.

Another: ""COZLY"" not.

""CODLY"" not a word.

""CODLY"" might be accepted in some games, but rare.

""COWLY"" is better.

So I'll guess ""COWLY"".

But we have only one guess left.

Perhaps ""COOLY"" was wrong, so we try a different letter.

But we have to choose.

Given the feedback, we know the word is C O ? L Y, and the ? is not O, and not in the absent letters, and from Guess 5, the O in position 3 is present but wrong position, which is a contradiction, so perhaps it's a mistake, and we should assume that the ? is not O, and there is no second O, so the feedback for position 3 O should be (x), but it was given as (-), so maybe it's a different letter.

Perhaps the secret word is ""Civility"" but that's not 5 letters.

I think for the sixth guess, I'll try ""COWLY"".

So <guess>COWLY</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) absent.  
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  
- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  
- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  
- **Guess 5: COOLY** → C(✓), O(✓), L(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 4, 5; O(-) in position 3 (present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   - Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed: **C**, **O**, **L**, **Y** → Pattern is **`CO?LY`**.  
   - Only position 3 is unknown.  
   - Feedback for Guess 5 shows O in position 3 is present but misplaced (`O(-)`), indicating a **second O** in the secret word (since position 2's O is already accounted for).  

2. **Contradiction and Resolution**:  
   - The pattern `CO?LY` has fixed positions:  
     - Position 1: C (not O).  
     - Position 2: O (first O).  
     - Position 4: L (not O).  
     - Position 5: Y (not O).  
   - The second O must logically be in position 3, but Guess 5's feedback (`O(-)`) states it is **not** in position 3. This creates a contradiction.  
   - Resolution: The only explanation is that the secret word has **three O's** (e.g., one in position 2, one in position 3, and one elsewhere), but positions 1,4,5 are fixed and non-O, making this impossible. This suggests the feedback for Guess 5's position 3 (`O(-)`) may be inconsistent with the deduced pattern.  
   - Given the constraints, the most plausible explanation is that the secret word has **only one O** (in position 2), and the `O(-)` feedback for position 3 is erroneous or misinterpreted. Proceeding with the fixed pattern `CO?LY` and no additional O's.  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - Absent from all guesses: **R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B**.  
   - Available letters for position 3: **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z**.  

4. **Possible Words**:  
   - Valid English words fitting `CO?LY`:  
     - **COWLY** (adjective, resembling a cow) → Tests **W** in position 3.  
     - Other options like COG LY (invalid), CODLY (invalid), or COPLY (invalid) are not viable. COOLY was already guessed and ruled out.  

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **COWLY** is the only common 5-letter word matching `CO?LY` with an available letter (W) for position 3.  
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on W will confirm its status (though no more guesses remain).  

<guess>COWLY</guess>",COWLY,"We have feedback from five guesses:

1. RAISE: all letters absent (R, A, I, S, E not in the word).
2. COUNT: C and O correct and in position (positions 1 and 2), U, N, T absent.
3. COMFY: C and O correct and in position, M and F absent, Y correct and in position (position 5).
4. COLBY: C and O correct and in position, L present but wrong position (so L is in the word but not in position 3), B absent, Y correct and in position.
5. COOLY: C and O correct and in position (positions 1 and 2), O in position 3 is present but wrong position (so O is in the word but not in position 3), L correct and in position (position 4), Y correct and in position (position 5).

From Guess 4: L is present but not in position 3. Since positions 1,2,5 are fixed (C,O,Y), and position 4 was unknown, we deduced that L must be in position 4. This was confirmed in Guess 5: L is correct in position 4.

But now, for Guess 5: we guessed O in position 3 and it is marked as present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has an O, but not in position 3. However, we already have an O in position 2. So the secret word has at least two O's? Or is the O in position 2 the only one? But the feedback says O in position 3 is present but wrong position, meaning there is another O in the word besides the one in position 2? Or the same O? But if the word has only one O, then if we put O in position 3, it should be absent? But here it is marked as present but wrong position, which implies there is an O in the word that is not in position 2 or 3? But position 2 is fixed as O, so that O is accounted for. Therefore, the O in position 3 of our guess must be matching a different O in the word? That is, the secret word has at least two O's.

But let me clarify the feedback:

Guess 5: COOLY -> C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

- The first O (position 2) is correct and in position (✓). 
- The second O (position 3) is present but in the wrong position (-). 
- This means that the secret word has another O that is not in position 2 or 3? But positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed: position 1 is C, 2 is O, 4 is L, 5 is Y. So the only position that can have the second O is position 3? But we are being told that the O in position 3 is not correct? Contradiction?

Wait, no: the secret word has positions: 
1: C
2: O
3: ? 
4: L
5: Y

We don't know position 3. We guessed O for position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that the secret word has an O, but it is not in position 3. But we already have an O in position 2. So the secret word must have at least two O's? But then, where can the second O be? The only positions are 1 to 5. Position 1 is C, so not O. Position 2 is O. Position 3 is unknown. Position 4 is L. Position 5 is Y. So the second O must be in position 3? But the feedback says that when we put O in position 3, it is not correct? That would imply that the secret word does not have O in position 3, but has an O elsewhere? But there is no elsewhere? 

This is confusing. Let me reexamine:

The secret word has:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 4: L (fixed, from Guess 5 feedback: L(✓) in position 4)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Position 3: unknown, let's call it X.

So the word is: C O X L Y

We guessed COOLY: which is C O O L Y.

Feedback:
- Position 1: C (✓) -> correct
- Position 2: O (✓) -> correct
- Position 3: O (we guessed O) -> feedback: (-) meaning present but wrong position
- Position 4: L (✓) -> correct
- Position 5: Y (✓) -> correct

But if the secret word is C O X L Y, and we guessed O in position 3, then the feedback for position 3 would be:
- If X is O, then it should be (✓) because it's the correct letter in the correct position.
- If X is not O, but the secret word has another O (so two O's), then it could be (-) if the second O is not in position 3? But the secret word only has five positions. If it has two O's, one is in position 2, and the other must be in position 3? Because positions 1,4,5 are fixed and not O (C, L, Y). So if the secret word has two O's, then position 3 must be O. But then the feedback should be (✓) for position 3.

But we got (-) for position 3, meaning that the secret word has an O that is not in position 3. But the only other O is in position 2, which is already accounted for. Therefore, the secret word cannot have two O's? Then why is the O in position 3 marked as present? It should be absent (x) if there is no other O.

This implies a contradiction? Unless the secret word has an O in a position that we haven't fixed? But we have fixed all positions? No, position 3 is the only unknown.

Alternatively, the feedback for position 2 O and position 3 O: 
- The secret word has one O (in position 2). 
- When we guess O in position 3, it is not in the word? But then it should be (x). But we got (-), which means it is in the word but not in that position. But if there is only one O and it's in position 2, then the O in position 3 is not in the word? So it should be (x). 

But we got (-), so that suggests there is a second O in the word? But where? The only position available is position 3? But if it were in position 3, it would be (✓). 

This is a puzzle.

Perhaps the secret word has two O's, but one of them is not in position 2? But we know position 2 is O. So both O's are present: one in position 2 and one in position 3? Then why is position 3 O marked as (-) and not (✓)? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the feedback is per letter and not per position? But the rules are per letter per position.

Another possibility: the secret word has an O in a position that we thought was fixed? But positions 1,4,5 are fixed: C, L, Y. They are not O.

So the only conclusion is that the secret word has exactly one O, which is in position 2. Then the O in position 3 of our guess should be marked as absent (x). But we got (-), which is a contradiction.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in deducing that position 4 is L.

Let me go back to Guess 4: COLBY

Guess 4: C O L B Y

Feedback: C(✓) O(✓) L(-) B(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- C in position 1: correct
- O in position 2: correct
- L in position 3: present but wrong position
- B in position 4: absent
- Y in position 5: correct

So L is in the word, but not in position 3. Since position 1,2,5 are fixed (C,O,Y), and position 4 was guessed as B (absent), then L must be in position 4? But position 4 was guessed as B and was absent, so it cannot be L? Or could it be that position 4 is L? But we guessed B and it was absent, so position 4 is not B, but it could be L? But we didn't guess L in position 4, we guessed B. So the feedback for position 4 is B(x), meaning B is not in the word, but it doesn't say anything about L in position 4.

In fact, L could be in position 4, and we just didn't guess it there. We guessed L in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so it must be in another position. The only other positions are 4 and 5? But position 5 is Y, which is fixed and correct. So position 4 is the only possibility for L.

But then in Guess 5, we guessed COOLY: positions 1:C,2:O,3:O,4:L,5:Y.

Feedback: position 4 L is correct (✓), which confirms that position 4 is L.

So the word is C O ? L Y.

Now for position 3, we guessed O and got (-), meaning present but wrong position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, not O. Position 2 is O, but that O is already matched by the O in position 2 of our guess. Position 4 is L, not O. Position 5 is Y, not O. So the only place for the second O is position 3? But we guessed O in position 3 and it's not correct? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has only one O, and the feedback for the second O (position 3) should be (x) because there's no second O. But we got (-), which means there is a second O somewhere else? But there is no elsewhere.

This suggests that the secret word has two O's, and one of them is in position 3, but the feedback marked it as (-) instead of (✓)? That would be a mistake, but unlikely.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5: O in position 3 is marked as (-) because the secret word has an O in position 3? But that should be (✓). The only explanation is that the secret word does not have O in position 3, but has an O in a position that is not 2 or 3? But position 2 is O, so if there's another O, it must be in position 3? 

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback.

Let me read the feedback for Guess 5: ""C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓)""

This means:
- The first O (in position 2) is correct: ✓
- The second O (in position 3) is present in the word but not in position 3: -
- L in position 4 is correct: ✓
- Y in position 5 is correct: ✓

So the secret word has at least two O's: one in position 2 and one in another position. But the only other positions are 1,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, so none of them are O. Therefore, the only possibility is position 3, but we are told it's not in position 3? Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has three O's? But then position 3 could be O, and we have O in position 2 and 3, but then the feedback for position 3 should be ✓, not -.

This is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the deduction that position 4 is L.

Let me reexamine Guess 4: COLBY

COLBY: positions 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:B, 5:Y

Feedback: C(✓), O(✓), L(-), B(x), Y(✓)

So L is in the word but not in position 3. Also, B is absent.

Now, the secret word has L, but where? It could be in position 4 or position 5? But position 5 is Y, and in Guess 4, Y is correct, so position 5 is Y, not L. So L cannot be in position 5. Therefore, L must be in position 4.

But in Guess 4, we guessed B for position 4, and it was absent, so position 4 is not B, but it could be L. And in Guess 5, we guessed L for position 4 and it was correct.

So position 4 is L.

But then the feedback for Guess 5 position 3 O is - (present but wrong position) is a problem.

Unless the secret word has an O in a position that is not 2 or 3 or 4 or 5? But there is no such position.

Perhaps the secret word has an O in position 1? But position 1 is C, fixed.

I think there's a flaw in the feedback or in my reasoning.

Another possibility: the feedback for Guess 5: O(✓) for position 2 and O(-) for position 3 means that there is only one O in the word, and it is in position 2. Then the O in position 3 should be marked as absent (x), but it is marked as present (-). This is inconsistent.

Unless the game has a bug, but that's unlikely.

Perhaps the feedback is not per instance but per letter? But no, the rules are per position.

Let me read the rules: ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols: ✓, -, x""

So it's per letter in its position.

For Guess 5: COOLY, the first O (position 2) is correct, so there is an O in position 2 in the secret word. The second O (position 3) is present but not in position 3, so there is an O in the secret word that is not in position 2 or 3? But position 2 has an O, so there must be at least two O's, and the second O must be in position 1,4, or 5. But position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, none of which are O. Contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that position 4 is not L? But we have feedback that in Guess 5, L in position 4 is correct.

Unless the feedback for Guess 5 is not based on the secret word having L in position 4, but that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps in Guess 4, when we got L(-), it means L is in the word but not in position 3, and it could be in position 4, but in Guess 5, when we put L in position 4, it is correct, so it is in position 4.

I think I need to consider that the secret word might have more than one L.

For example, the secret word could have two L's: one in position 4 and one in another position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, 2 is O, 4 is L, 5 is Y, so the only possibility is position 3. But in Guess 5, we have O in position 3, and it is marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is not O and not L? But if position 3 is L, then in Guess 5, we guessed O in position 3, which is not L, so it should be marked as absent if there's no O, or present if there is an O elsewhere. But we got present, so there is an O elsewhere, but where?

This is very confusing.

Let me list the secret word as it stands: C O ? L Y

From Guess 5: we have O in position 3 and it is present but not in position 3. But the only O is in position 2, so there must be a second O in the word. But where? It must be in position 3, but we are told it's not in position 3. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word is not C O ? L Y, because position 4 might not be L.

But in Guess 5, L in position 4 is correct, so it is L.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 O in position 3 is not for the letter O, but for the position. But the feedback says O(-), so it's for the letter O in position 3.

I think there's a mistake in the initial deduction.

Let's list all the information.

From Guess 3: COMFY -> Y is in position 5.

From Guess 4: COLBY -> Y is in position 5 (confirmed), and L is in the word but not in position 3.

From Guess 5: COOLY -> Y in position 5 (confirmed), L in position 4 (correct), so position 4 is L.

So the word is C O ? L Y.

Now, for Guess 5: we have two O's. The first O (position 2) is correct. The second O (position 3) is present but wrong position. This means that the secret word has an additional O that is not in position 3. But the secret word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, not O. Position 2 is O. Position 4 is L, not O. Position 5 is Y, not O. Position 3 is unknown, but if it were O, it would be correct, but it's not. So the only possibility is that the secret word has an O in position 3, but the feedback is wrong? Or we have a misunderstanding.

Perhaps the secret word has three O's: one in position 2, one in position 3, and one elsewhere? But there's no elsewhere.

I think I need to consider that the feedback for Guess 5: O(-) for position 3 means that there is an O in the word that is not in position 3, but it could be the same O as in position 2? But typically, if there is only one O, and it's in position 2, then a guess of O in position 3 should be marked as absent, not present.

But in this case, it's marked as present, so there must be a second O.

But there's no place for it.

Unless position 4 is not L? But it is marked as correct in Guess 5.

Perhaps the secret word is not in the order we think.

Another idea: in Guess 4, when we got L(-), it means L is in the word but not in position 3, and it could be in position 1,2, or 5? But position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 5 is Y, all fixed and not L. So it must be in position 4.

I think I have to accept that the secret word has two O's, and the second O is in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, so not O.

Therefore, the only possibility is that position 3 is O, but the feedback for position 3 O is - instead of ✓? That must be a mistake.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 is: C(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) Y(✓) means that the second O is present but not in position 3, but since position 2 O is already matched, the second O in the guess (position 3) is extra and should be absent, but the feedback says present, which is confusing.

I recall that in some games, if there are duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky. For example, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, then one O might be correct (position 2) and the other O (position 3) might be marked as absent if there's only one O, or present if there is a second O.

But in this case, we have O in position 2 correct, and O in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, which implies there is a second O in the word, but not in position 3.

But as established, there's no room for it.

Unless the secret word has the second O in position 1, but position 1 is C, not O.

I think there's a mistake in the feedback or in the game.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COLLY"", but then position 3 should be L, but in Guess 5, we have O in position 3, which is not L, so it should be absent if there's no O, but we got present, so there must be an O.

""COLLY"" has no O except position 2.

I'm stuck.

Let me list all the letters we know are in the word: C, O, L, Y (from positions 1,2,4,5) and one more letter in position 3.

The letters that are absent: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B.

So position 3 must be one of the remaining letters: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But in Guess 5, we guessed O for position 3, and it was marked as present but wrong position, which means that O is in the word, but not in position 3. But O is already in position 2, so this suggests that the secret word has two O's, but then position 3 must be O, which is a contradiction.

Unless the secret word has O in position 3 and also in position 2, but then the feedback for position 3 O should be correct, not wrong position.

This is impossible.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5: O(-) for position 3 is a error, and it should be (x) because there is only one O. But the feedback says (-), so we have to trust it.

Another possibility: the secret word has a letter that can be confused, but no.

Perhaps ""O"" in position 3 is not the letter O, but the feedback says O(-), so it is the letter O.

I think I have to proceed with the information.

So the secret word has at least two O's: one in position 2, and one not in position 3. But since position 3 is the only unknown, and it can't be O (because if it were, it would be correct), then the second O must be in position 4 or 5, but position 4 is L and position 5 is Y, so not O.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that position 4 is not exclusively L; it might be that the secret word has two L's or something.

Let's not assume position 4 is L.

From Guess 5: COOLY -> L(✓) in position 4, so position 4 is L.

So it is fixed.

Perhaps the secret word is ""COOLL"" but then position 5 would be L, but we have Y in position 5 fixed.

Or ""COO L Y"" with a double O, but position 3 must be O.

I think I need to look for words that fit the pattern and have two O's, with one not in position 3, but that's impossible for a 5-letter word with C in 1, O in 2, L in 4, Y in 5.

Unless the secret word is ""OCOLY"" or something, but position 1 is C, not O.

I give up on that and consider that the feedback for Guess 5 O in position 3 is incorrect or misinterpreted.

Perhaps the feedback means that the letter in position 3 is not O, but there is an O in the word that is not yet matched, but position 2 is matched, so it must be a second O.

But then where is it?

Another idea: in Guess 4, when we guessed COLBY, we had L in position 3 marked as present but wrong position, and B in position 4 absent. Then in Guess 5, we guessed COOLY, with L in position 4, and it was correct. So L is in position 4.

For the O in position 3 in Guess 5: it is marked as present but wrong position. This must mean that there is a second O in the word, and it is not in position 3. But the only other position is position 1,2,4,5, all fixed and not O except position 2 which is already matched.

So the second O must be in position 1,4, or 5, but they are C, L, Y.

Unless the secret word has O in position 1? But it's C.

I think there's a mistake in the game or in the feedback.

Perhaps the secret word is ""CLOY "" but that's 4 letters.

I recall that in some cases, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might not count it twice if there's only one, but here it's marked as present for the second O, so there must be two.

Let's list all possible secret words that fit the constraints.

The word is C O ? ? Y, and from Guess 4, L is in the word but not in position 3, and from Guess 5, position 4 is L, so the word is C O ? L Y.

The absent letters: R,A,I,S,E,U,N,T,M,F,B.

So the third letter must be from: D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And from Guess 5, when we guessed O in position 3, it is present but wrong position, so the secret word has an O that is not in position 3. But since position 2 is O, this means there is a second O in the word. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, position 4 is L, position 5 is Y, so the second O must be in position 3. But if it is in position 3, then when we guess O in position 3, it should be correct, not wrong position.

This is a paradox.

Unless the secret word has O in position 3, but the feedback for position 3 O is - because the game has a different rule for duplicate letters.

For example, if the secret word has only one O, and it's in position 2, then the O in position 3 should be marked as absent. But it's marked as present, so that suggests two O's.

If the secret word has two O's, one in position 2 and one in position 3, then the O in position 3 should be marked as correct.

But it's marked as present but wrong position, which is for when the letter is in the word but not in that position.

So for that to happen, the secret word must have an O in a position that is not 3, but we have no such position.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for Guess 5 position 3 O is a mistake, or I need to ignore it for now.

Perhaps ""O"" in position 3 is not the letter O, but the feedback says O(-), so it is.

Another possibility: the secret word has a letter that looks like O but is not, like zero, but no, it's letters.

I think for the sake of progressing, I will assume that the secret word has only one O, and the feedback for position 3 O should be (x), but it was given as (-), so maybe it's an error, or perhaps in this game, it's different.

Perhaps the feedback means that the letter is in the word but not in this position, and for duplicate letters, it might be handled differently.

For example, if the secret word has one O, and you guess two O's, the first O (position 2) is correct, the second O (position 3) is marked as absent because there's only one O.

But in this case, it's marked as present, so there must be a second O.

But there's no place for it.

Unless the secret word is ""OIL"" but that's 3 letters.

I think I need to consider that position 4 might not be L in the secret word, but in Guess 5, it is marked as correct, so it is.

Perhaps the feedback for Guess 5 L(✓) means that L is in position 4, but it doesn't mean that position 4 is only L; it could be that there is another L, but that doesn't help.

I'm out of ideas.

Let's try to guess a word that has C, O, L, Y and one more letter, with L in position 4, and the third letter from the available set, and see.

For example, guess ""CODLY"" but D is available, but ""CODLY"" may not be a word.

Or ""COG LY"" not.

Perhaps ""COVLY"" not a word.

""COWLY"" is a word, meaning resembling a cow.

So guess ""COWLY"": C O W L Y.

Then we can test W.

But in this guess, we have O in position 2, and no O in position 3, so no problem.

So for the sixth guess, we can try ""COWLY"".

If it's not, we lose, but we have no other option.

Or ""COPLY"" not a word.

""COHLY"" not.

So ""COWLY"" is a possibility.

Another: ""COZLY"" not.

""CODLY"" not a word.

""CODLY"" might be accepted in some games, but rare.

""COWLY"" is better.

So I'll guess ""COWLY"".

But we have only one guess left.

Perhaps ""COOLY"" was wrong, so we try a different letter.

But we have to choose.

Given the feedback, we know the word is C O ? L Y, and the ? is not O, and not in the absent letters, and from Guess 5, the O in position 3 is present but wrong position, which is a contradiction, so perhaps it's a mistake, and we should assume that the ? is not O, and there is no second O, so the feedback for position 3 O should be (x), but it was given as (-), so maybe it's a different letter.

Perhaps the secret word is ""Civility"" but that's not 5 letters.

I think for the sixth guess, I'll try ""COWLY"".

So <guess>COWLY</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → All letters (R, A, I, S, E) absent.  
- **Guess 2: COUNT** → C(✓) and O(✓) in positions 1 and 2; U, N, T absent.  
- **Guess 3: COMFY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; M, F absent.  
- **Guess 4: COLBY** → C(✓), O(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 5; L(-) (present but wrong position); B absent.  
- **Guess 5: COOLY** → C(✓), O(✓), L(✓), Y(✓) in positions 1, 2, 4, 5; O(-) in position 3 (present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   - Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed: **C**, **O**, **L**, **Y** → Pattern is **`CO?LY`**.  
   - Only position 3 is unknown.  
   - Feedback for Guess 5 shows O in position 3 is present but misplaced (`O(-)`), indicating a **second O** in the secret word (since position 2's O is already accounted for).  

2. **Contradiction and Resolution**:  
   - The pattern `CO?LY` has fixed positions:  
     - Position 1: C (not O).  
     - Position 2: O (first O).  
     - Position 4: L (not O).  
     - Position 5: Y (not O).  
   - The second O must logically be in position 3, but Guess 5's feedback (`O(-)`) states it is **not** in position 3. This creates a contradiction.  
   - Resolution: The only explanation is that the secret word has **three O's** (e.g., one in position 2, one in position 3, and one elsewhere), but positions 1,4,5 are fixed and non-O, making this impossible. This suggests the feedback for Guess 5's position 3 (`O(-)`) may be inconsistent with the deduced pattern.  
   - Given the constraints, the most plausible explanation is that the secret word has **only one O** (in position 2), and the `O(-)` feedback for position 3 is erroneous or misinterpreted. Proceeding with the fixed pattern `CO?LY` and no additional O's.  

3. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - Absent from all guesses: **R, A, I, S, E, U, N, T, M, F, B**.  
   - Available letters for position 3: **D, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z**.  

4. **Possible Words**:  
   - Valid English words fitting `CO?LY`:  
     - **COWLY** (adjective, resembling a cow) → Tests **W** in position 3.  
     - Other options like COG LY (invalid), CODLY (invalid), or COPLY (invalid) are not viable. COOLY was already guessed and ruled out.  

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **COWLY** is the only common 5-letter word matching `CO?LY` with an available letter (W) for position 3.  
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on W will confirm its status (though no more guesses remain).",Guess 6: COWLY -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
