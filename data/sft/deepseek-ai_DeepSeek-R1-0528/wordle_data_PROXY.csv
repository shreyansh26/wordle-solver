We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (but T is repeated, might not be ideal for information)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (B, R, O, I, L)
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Also, note that we have only one correct letter so far (R in position 2). We need to test other positions.

Let me consider ""BROIL"":
- B: new letter, in position 1
- R: known, in position 2
- O: new letter, in position 3
- I: new letter, in position 4
- L: new letter, in position 5

This tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""PROUD"":
- P: new, position 1
- R: known, position 2
- O: new, position 3
- U: new, position 4
- D: new, position 5

Also tests four new letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but since we are avoiding known absent letters, we can choose any valid word.

Another common word is ""SPRIT"" (but S is common) or ""GRIMY"".

However, we must ensure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another option: ""TRYST"" has T and S, but T is repeated. Not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M. This has S and M, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. PRISM doesn't have those.

PRISM: 
- P: position 1
- R: position 2 (correct)
- I: position 3
- S: position 4
- M: position 5

This tests P, I, S, M.

Similarly, ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D (repeated D) - not ideal.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate.

But let me also consider ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T. This tests F, U, I, T.

We don't have a strong preference, but we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which we already have some info on) are: O, I, T, N, S, L, etc. But we know N is out, so O, I, T, S, L.

So, a word that includes O, I, T, S, L would be good, but we have to have R in the second position.

Possible words: 
- ""TROIS"" (but T is first, and we have R second, then O, I, S) - but TROIS is a valid word? It means three in French, but might be accepted.
- ""GROSS"" (G, R, O, S, S) - repeated S.

Alternatively, ""BROWS"" (B, R, O, W, S) - but W is less common.

I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice because it uses P, R, I, S, M, and these are fairly common.

But note: we have already ruled out A, C, E, N. So we can use any other letters.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so we cannot use C.

So, I'll go with ""PRISM"".

But wait, let me confirm: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is correct and in position, and the others are absent. So we are safe to use PRISM.

So, my next guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

So, the guess is ""prism"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test new positions (e.g., S, T, I, O, M, P).

A strong candidate is ""PRISM"":

After the first guess ""crane"", we got feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x). This means:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

So secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"". Feedback: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x). This means:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (first letter).
- R is correct and in position (we already knew that).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

New information:
- P is the first letter and R is the second, so the secret word starts with PR.
- I, S, M are not in the word, so we can eliminate these letters.
- Previously eliminated: C, A, N, E.

Current eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Secret word pattern: P R _ _ _

We need to find a word that starts with PR, doesn't contain any eliminated letters, and tests other positions.

Possible letters: after eliminating C,A,N,E,I,S,M, we have remaining letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common ones.

Common vowels left are O, U; consonants B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, etc.

The word must be PR followed by three other letters, none of which are eliminated.

We need to guess words that help identify the remaining letters. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, we should include common letters to test.

Possible words starting with PR: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PRODS, PROLE, PROSY, etc. But must be 5 letters and valid.

Let's consider:
- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PRONG (P,R,O,N,G) — but N is eliminated, can't use.
- PRANK — has A and N, eliminated.
- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.
- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.
- PROBE — has E, eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.

PROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.
PROWL: uses O,W,L.
PROXY: uses O,X,Y.
BROTH — but starts with B, not PR.

More words: 
- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.
- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.
- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.
- PLUME — but starts with PL, not PR.

After eliminating letters, common words might be:
- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PRUDE (but E is out, so invalid? PRUDE has E? Wait: PRUDE ends with E, and E is eliminated because ""crane"" E was marked x, meaning no E in word. So cannot use E.

Similarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.

So PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.

But PROUD: P,R,O,U,D. O,U,D are new letters.

Similarly, GROWL but starts with G, wrong first letter.

Our pattern is fixed: must start with PR.

So only words beginning with PR.

Other options: PROLE — not very common, and has E? PROLE: P,R,O,L,E — E eliminated, so no.
PROSE — has S, eliminated.
PRONE — has N,E, eliminated.
PRIME — has I,M, eliminated.
PRESS — has S,S.

So PROUD seems good? Or perhaps PROWL.

Another: PROOF — but O repeated? And has F? PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. Double O, which might be okay if O is in word, but we don't know.

But we want to test different letters.

PRONG has N, eliminated.

I think PROUD is a common word. Also, PRUDE has E, but E is out, so not.

What about PRYER? But R is repeated? PRYER: P,R,Y,E,R — has E, eliminated.

Focus on words without eliminated letters.

Allowable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common combinations: PRO_ _, so third letter often vowel like O.

Possible words:
- PROUD: P,R,O,U,D
- PROWL: P,R,O,W,L
- PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y — less common letters.
- PROFS? Not a word.
- PROMO — but M and O, M eliminated? PROMO: P,R,O,M,O — M is eliminated, so no.
- PROSY? But S is eliminated, PROSY has S, from S in sys? PROSY is a word? Adjective meaning tedious or commonplace, but has S.

How about PROBE? But E is eliminated.

PROTE — not common word.

PRATT? Has T,T, but P,R,A,T,T — A is eliminated.

So best bet might be PROUD or PROWL.

PROUD tests O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

PROWL tests O in 3, W in 4, L in 5.

We don't know if vowels are needed. Remaining vowels are O,U, and sometimes Y.

Y could be used, e.g., PRY or words like PRYER but has E.

Perhaps BROOD? But starts with B, incorrect.

Must start with P R.

Another word: PROGS — not common.

PROKE? Not common.

Perhaps PRESS? But S eliminated.

So among valid options, PROUD is valid and common. Let's go with that.

But is there a word with more common letters? Like T or something, but third position.

For example, PRUTE? Not a word.

PROPER? But longer and repeats P.

No, 5 letters: PRO something.

PRANK? A eliminated.

I think PROUD is fine.

Perhaps GROWL is not right—must start PR.

Another word: PRIED? But I eliminated.

So, I'll choose PROUD.

But let's confirm feedback possibilities.

If secret word is PROUD, we get all correct? But we don't know yet.

We need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.

PROUD uses O,U,D.

If we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.

But any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.

Another common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.

PROXY has X and Y, less common.

So I think PROUD is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: PROUD.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""prism""):
  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.
  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.
  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Secret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  

Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  
Available letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  

### Thought process for next guess:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- Candidate words:
  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.
  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.
  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.
- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.

Next guess: ""PROUD"".  

<guess>proud</guess>",proud,"After the first guess ""crane"", we got feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x). This means:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

So secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"". Feedback: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x). This means:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (first letter).
- R is correct and in position (we already knew that).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

New information:
- P is the first letter and R is the second, so the secret word starts with PR.
- I, S, M are not in the word, so we can eliminate these letters.

- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.
- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.
- PROBE — has E, eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.

PROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.
PROWL: uses O,W,L.
PROXY: uses O,X,Y.
BROTH — but starts with B, not PR.

More words: 
- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.
- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.
- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.

After eliminating letters, common words might be:

Similarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.

So PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PROXY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (but T is repeated, might not be ideal for information)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (B, R, O, I, L)
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Also, note that we have only one correct letter so far (R in position 2). We need to test other positions.

Let me consider ""BROIL"":
- B: new letter, in position 1
- R: known, in position 2
- O: new letter, in position 3
- I: new letter, in position 4
- L: new letter, in position 5

This tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""PROUD"":
- P: new, position 1
- R: known, position 2
- O: new, position 3
- U: new, position 4
- D: new, position 5

Also tests four new letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but since we are avoiding known absent letters, we can choose any valid word.

Another common word is ""SPRIT"" (but S is common) or ""GRIMY"".

However, we must ensure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another option: ""TRYST"" has T and S, but T is repeated. Not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M. This has S and M, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. PRISM doesn't have those.

PRISM: 
- P: position 1
- R: position 2 (correct)
- I: position 3
- S: position 4
- M: position 5

This tests P, I, S, M.

Similarly, ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D (repeated D) - not ideal.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate.

But let me also consider ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T. This tests F, U, I, T.

We don't have a strong preference, but we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which we already have some info on) are: O, I, T, N, S, L, etc. But we know N is out, so O, I, T, S, L.

So, a word that includes O, I, T, S, L would be good, but we have to have R in the second position.

Possible words: 
- ""TROIS"" (but T is first, and we have R second, then O, I, S) - but TROIS is a valid word? It means three in French, but might be accepted.
- ""GROSS"" (G, R, O, S, S) - repeated S.

Alternatively, ""BROWS"" (B, R, O, W, S) - but W is less common.

I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice because it uses P, R, I, S, M, and these are fairly common.

But note: we have already ruled out A, C, E, N. So we can use any other letters.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so we cannot use C.

So, I'll go with ""PRISM"".

But wait, let me confirm: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is correct and in position, and the others are absent. So we are safe to use PRISM.

So, my next guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

So, the guess is ""prism"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test new positions (e.g., S, T, I, O, M, P).

A strong candidate is ""PRISM"":
- Tests P (position 1), I (position 3), S (position 4), and M (position 5).
- Uses common letters to maximize information.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

<guess>prism</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>After the first guess ""crane"", we got feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x). This means:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

So secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"". Feedback: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x). This means:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (first letter).
- R is correct and in position (we already knew that).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

New information:
- P is the first letter and R is the second, so the secret word starts with PR.
- I, S, M are not in the word, so we can eliminate these letters.
- Previously eliminated: C, A, N, E.

Current eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Secret word pattern: P R _ _ _

We need to find a word that starts with PR, doesn't contain any eliminated letters, and tests other positions.

Possible letters: after eliminating C,A,N,E,I,S,M, we have remaining letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common ones.

Common vowels left are O, U; consonants B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, etc.

The word must be PR followed by three other letters, none of which are eliminated.

We need to guess words that help identify the remaining letters. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, we should include common letters to test.

Possible words starting with PR: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PRODS, PROLE, PROSY, etc. But must be 5 letters and valid.

Let's consider:
- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PRONG (P,R,O,N,G) — but N is eliminated, can't use.
- PRANK — has A and N, eliminated.
- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.
- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.
- PROBE — has E, eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.

PROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.
PROWL: uses O,W,L.
PROXY: uses O,X,Y.
BROTH — but starts with B, not PR.

More words: 
- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.
- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.
- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.
- PLUME — but starts with PL, not PR.

After eliminating letters, common words might be:
- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PRUDE (but E is out, so invalid? PRUDE has E? Wait: PRUDE ends with E, and E is eliminated because ""crane"" E was marked x, meaning no E in word. So cannot use E.

Similarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.

So PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.

But PROUD: P,R,O,U,D. O,U,D are new letters.

Similarly, GROWL but starts with G, wrong first letter.

Our pattern is fixed: must start with PR.

So only words beginning with PR.

Other options: PROLE — not very common, and has E? PROLE: P,R,O,L,E — E eliminated, so no.
PROSE — has S, eliminated.
PRONE — has N,E, eliminated.
PRIME — has I,M, eliminated.
PRESS — has S,S.

So PROUD seems good? Or perhaps PROWL.

Another: PROOF — but O repeated? And has F? PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. Double O, which might be okay if O is in word, but we don't know.

But we want to test different letters.

PRONG has N, eliminated.

I think PROUD is a common word. Also, PRUDE has E, but E is out, so not.

What about PRYER? But R is repeated? PRYER: P,R,Y,E,R — has E, eliminated.

Focus on words without eliminated letters.

Allowable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common combinations: PRO_ _, so third letter often vowel like O.

Possible words:
- PROUD: P,R,O,U,D
- PROWL: P,R,O,W,L
- PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y — less common letters.
- PROFS? Not a word.
- PROMO — but M and O, M eliminated? PROMO: P,R,O,M,O — M is eliminated, so no.
- PROSY? But S is eliminated, PROSY has S, from S in sys? PROSY is a word? Adjective meaning tedious or commonplace, but has S.

How about PROBE? But E is eliminated.

PROTE — not common word.

PRATT? Has T,T, but P,R,A,T,T — A is eliminated.

So best bet might be PROUD or PROWL.

PROUD tests O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

PROWL tests O in 3, W in 4, L in 5.

We don't know if vowels are needed. Remaining vowels are O,U, and sometimes Y.

Y could be used, e.g., PRY or words like PRYER but has E.

Perhaps BROOD? But starts with B, incorrect.

Must start with P R.

Another word: PROGS — not common.

PROKE? Not common.

Perhaps PRESS? But S eliminated.

So among valid options, PROUD is valid and common. Let's go with that.

But is there a word with more common letters? Like T or something, but third position.

For example, PRUTE? Not a word.

PROPER? But longer and repeats P.

No, 5 letters: PRO something.

PRANK? A eliminated.

I think PROUD is fine.

Perhaps GROWL is not right—must start PR.

Another word: PRIED? But I eliminated.

So, I'll choose PROUD.

But let's confirm feedback possibilities.

If secret word is PROUD, we get all correct? But we don't know yet.

We need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.

PROUD uses O,U,D.

If we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.

But any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.

Another common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.

PROXY has X and Y, less common.

So I think PROUD is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: PROUD.Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""prism""):
  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.
  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.
  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Secret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  

Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  
Available letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  

### Thought process for next guess:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- Candidate words:
  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.
  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.
  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.
- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.

Next guess: ""PROUD"".

We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".
- I, S, M are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- O: correct (✓) at position 3
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)

So, now we know:
- The word is ""P R O _ _""
- U and D are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.

The word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.

But note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

So, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven't seen any repeats, and we don't have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.

But in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O's? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn't say anything about other O's. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.

Now, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:

- PROWL
- PROOF
- PROBE (but E is eliminated)
- PROSE (S eliminated)
- PRONE (N and E eliminated)
- PRICE (C and E eliminated)
- PRANK (A and N eliminated)
- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)
- PROXY

Looking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.

PROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.

PROOF: O and F. But it has two O's? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.

But we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn't have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don't know about position 4.

Similarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about O.

So PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it's allowed.

But in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don't know if the secret word has a second O.

Similarly, F is available.

But we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn't contain them.

Another word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.

PRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.

Other words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.

So possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).

Also, PROLL? Not a word.

PROUD is out because U and D are absent.

So let's list valid words:

- PROWL: uses W and L
- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)
- PROXY: uses X and Y
- PROBS? Not a word.
- PROBE: E eliminated.
- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.

What about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.

PROTE? Not common.

Another one: PROAS? Not common.

I think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, we need to choose one that gives us information.

But note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.

We have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.

We can try a word that uses two new letters to test.

But if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

But if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.

But to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.

So PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.

PROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.

Common endings: for example, PRO + L + Y? But Y is available, but PROLY is not a word.

PRO + B + E? E eliminated.

PRO + T + E? E eliminated.

PRO + W + L? PROWL.

PRO + F + T? Not a word.

Another word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.

What about ""PROSO""? Not a word.

I think PROWL is a good candidate.

But let's check if there are other words.

""PROLL"" is not a word.

""PROEM"" has E and M, eliminated.

""PROUD"" is out.

""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.

""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.

So, among the valid options, PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROOF has the advantage that if the word has a double O, we'll know, but if not, we get information on F.

Similarly, PROWL tests W and L.

But since we have limited guesses, and we want to cover more ground, perhaps PROWL is better because it uses two distinct new letters.

Also, L is a common letter.

PROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it's wrong, we might not learn as much.

Therefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.

But we must output the guess.

So, next guess: PROWL.

But let's confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.

Also, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn't have W or L, so we don't know.

So, I think it's fine.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.

### Key Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O is already placed but may repeat; other letters are untested for positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word starts with ""PRO"", so we need to guess the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., L, T, F, W).
- Possible valid words include ""PROWL"" (tests W and L), ""PROOF"" (tests double O and F), or ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y). ""PROWL"" is chosen because:
  - It uses two distinct, common letters (W and L) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids less common letters (like X and Y in ""PROXY"") and potential inefficiency of double letters (like in ""PROOF"").
- If ""PROWL"" is incorrect, feedback on W and L will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if W or L is present/absent).

<guess>prowl</guess>",prowl,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".
- I, S, M are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- O: correct (✓) at position 3
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)

So, now we know:
- The word is ""P R O _ _""
- U and D are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.

The word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.

But note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

So, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven't seen any repeats, and we don't have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.

But in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O's? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn't say anything about other O's. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.

Now, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:

- PROWL
- PROOF
- PROBE (but E is eliminated)
- PROSE (S eliminated)
- PRONE (N and E eliminated)
- PRICE (C and E eliminated)
- PRANK (A and N eliminated)
- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)
- PROXY

Looking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.

PROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.

PROOF: O and F. But it has two O's? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.

But we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn't have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don't know about position 4.

Similarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about O.

So PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it's allowed.

But in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don't know if the secret word has a second O.

Similarly, F is available.

But we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn't contain them.

Another word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.

PRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.

Other words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.

So possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).

Also, PROLL? Not a word.

PROUD is out because U and D are absent.

So let's list valid words:

- PROWL: uses W and L
- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)
- PROXY: uses X and Y
- PROBS? Not a word.
- PROBE: E eliminated.
- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.

What about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.

PROTE? Not common.

Another one: PROAS? Not common.

I think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, we need to choose one that gives us information.

But note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.

We have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.

We can try a word that uses two new letters to test.

But if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

But if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.

But to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.

So PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.

PROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.

Another word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.

What about ""PROSO""? Not a word.

I think PROWL is a good candidate.

But let's check if there are other words.

""PROUD"" is out.

""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.

""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.

PROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it's wrong, we might not learn as much.

Therefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.

But we must output the guess.

So, next guess: PROWL.

But let's confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.

Also, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn't have W or L, so we don't know.

So, I think it's fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.

### Key Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (but T is repeated, might not be ideal for information)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (B, R, O, I, L)
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Also, note that we have only one correct letter so far (R in position 2). We need to test other positions.

Let me consider ""BROIL"":
- B: new letter, in position 1
- R: known, in position 2
- O: new letter, in position 3
- I: new letter, in position 4
- L: new letter, in position 5

This tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""PROUD"":
- P: new, position 1
- R: known, position 2
- O: new, position 3
- U: new, position 4
- D: new, position 5

Also tests four new letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but since we are avoiding known absent letters, we can choose any valid word.

Another common word is ""SPRIT"" (but S is common) or ""GRIMY"".

However, we must ensure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another option: ""TRYST"" has T and S, but T is repeated. Not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M. This has S and M, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. PRISM doesn't have those.

PRISM: 
- P: position 1
- R: position 2 (correct)
- I: position 3
- S: position 4
- M: position 5

This tests P, I, S, M.

Similarly, ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D (repeated D) - not ideal.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate.

But let me also consider ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T. This tests F, U, I, T.

We don't have a strong preference, but we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which we already have some info on) are: O, I, T, N, S, L, etc. But we know N is out, so O, I, T, S, L.

So, a word that includes O, I, T, S, L would be good, but we have to have R in the second position.

Possible words: 
- ""TROIS"" (but T is first, and we have R second, then O, I, S) - but TROIS is a valid word? It means three in French, but might be accepted.
- ""GROSS"" (G, R, O, S, S) - repeated S.

Alternatively, ""BROWS"" (B, R, O, W, S) - but W is less common.

I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice because it uses P, R, I, S, M, and these are fairly common.

But note: we have already ruled out A, C, E, N. So we can use any other letters.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so we cannot use C.

So, I'll go with ""PRISM"".

But wait, let me confirm: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is correct and in position, and the others are absent. So we are safe to use PRISM.

So, my next guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

So, the guess is ""prism"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test new positions (e.g., S, T, I, O, M, P).

A strong candidate is ""PRISM"":
- Tests P (position 1), I (position 3), S (position 4), and M (position 5).
- Uses common letters to maximize information.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

<guess>prism</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>After the first guess ""crane"", we got feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x). This means:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

So secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"". Feedback: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x). This means:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (first letter).
- R is correct and in position (we already knew that).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

New information:
- P is the first letter and R is the second, so the secret word starts with PR.
- I, S, M are not in the word, so we can eliminate these letters.
- Previously eliminated: C, A, N, E.

Current eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Secret word pattern: P R _ _ _

We need to find a word that starts with PR, doesn't contain any eliminated letters, and tests other positions.

Possible letters: after eliminating C,A,N,E,I,S,M, we have remaining letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common ones.

Common vowels left are O, U; consonants B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, etc.

The word must be PR followed by three other letters, none of which are eliminated.

We need to guess words that help identify the remaining letters. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, we should include common letters to test.

Possible words starting with PR: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PRODS, PROLE, PROSY, etc. But must be 5 letters and valid.

Let's consider:
- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PRONG (P,R,O,N,G) — but N is eliminated, can't use.
- PRANK — has A and N, eliminated.
- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.
- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.
- PROBE — has E, eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.

PROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.
PROWL: uses O,W,L.
PROXY: uses O,X,Y.
BROTH — but starts with B, not PR.

More words: 
- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.
- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.
- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.
- PLUME — but starts with PL, not PR.

After eliminating letters, common words might be:
- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PRUDE (but E is out, so invalid? PRUDE has E? Wait: PRUDE ends with E, and E is eliminated because ""crane"" E was marked x, meaning no E in word. So cannot use E.

Similarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.

So PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.

But PROUD: P,R,O,U,D. O,U,D are new letters.

Similarly, GROWL but starts with G, wrong first letter.

Our pattern is fixed: must start with PR.

So only words beginning with PR.

Other options: PROLE — not very common, and has E? PROLE: P,R,O,L,E — E eliminated, so no.
PROSE — has S, eliminated.
PRONE — has N,E, eliminated.
PRIME — has I,M, eliminated.
PRESS — has S,S.

So PROUD seems good? Or perhaps PROWL.

Another: PROOF — but O repeated? And has F? PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. Double O, which might be okay if O is in word, but we don't know.

But we want to test different letters.

PRONG has N, eliminated.

I think PROUD is a common word. Also, PRUDE has E, but E is out, so not.

What about PRYER? But R is repeated? PRYER: P,R,Y,E,R — has E, eliminated.

Focus on words without eliminated letters.

Allowable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common combinations: PRO_ _, so third letter often vowel like O.

Possible words:
- PROUD: P,R,O,U,D
- PROWL: P,R,O,W,L
- PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y — less common letters.
- PROFS? Not a word.
- PROMO — but M and O, M eliminated? PROMO: P,R,O,M,O — M is eliminated, so no.
- PROSY? But S is eliminated, PROSY has S, from S in sys? PROSY is a word? Adjective meaning tedious or commonplace, but has S.

How about PROBE? But E is eliminated.

PROTE — not common word.

PRATT? Has T,T, but P,R,A,T,T — A is eliminated.

So best bet might be PROUD or PROWL.

PROUD tests O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

PROWL tests O in 3, W in 4, L in 5.

We don't know if vowels are needed. Remaining vowels are O,U, and sometimes Y.

Y could be used, e.g., PRY or words like PRYER but has E.

Perhaps BROOD? But starts with B, incorrect.

Must start with P R.

Another word: PROGS — not common.

PROKE? Not common.

Perhaps PRESS? But S eliminated.

So among valid options, PROUD is valid and common. Let's go with that.

But is there a word with more common letters? Like T or something, but third position.

For example, PRUTE? Not a word.

PROPER? But longer and repeats P.

No, 5 letters: PRO something.

PRANK? A eliminated.

I think PROUD is fine.

Perhaps GROWL is not right—must start PR.

Another word: PRIED? But I eliminated.

So, I'll choose PROUD.

But let's confirm feedback possibilities.

If secret word is PROUD, we get all correct? But we don't know yet.

We need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.

PROUD uses O,U,D.

If we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.

But any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.

Another common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.

PROXY has X and Y, less common.

So I think PROUD is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: PROUD.Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""prism""):
  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.
  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.
  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Secret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  

Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  
Available letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  

### Thought process for next guess:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- Candidate words:
  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.
  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.
  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.
- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.

Next guess: ""PROUD"".

<guess>proud</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
Guess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".
- I, S, M are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- O: correct (✓) at position 3
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)

So, now we know:
- The word is ""P R O _ _""
- U and D are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.

The word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.

But note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

So, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven't seen any repeats, and we don't have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.

But in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O's? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn't say anything about other O's. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.

Now, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:

- PROWL
- PROOF
- PROBE (but E is eliminated)
- PROSE (S eliminated)
- PRONE (N and E eliminated)
- PRICE (C and E eliminated)
- PRANK (A and N eliminated)
- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)
- PROXY

Looking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.

PROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.

PROOF: O and F. But it has two O's? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.

But we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn't have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don't know about position 4.

Similarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about O.

So PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it's allowed.

But in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don't know if the secret word has a second O.

Similarly, F is available.

But we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn't contain them.

Another word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.

PRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.

Other words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.

So possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).

Also, PROLL? Not a word.

PROUD is out because U and D are absent.

So let's list valid words:

- PROWL: uses W and L
- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)
- PROXY: uses X and Y
- PROBS? Not a word.
- PROBE: E eliminated.
- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.

What about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.

PROTE? Not common.

Another one: PROAS? Not common.

I think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, we need to choose one that gives us information.

But note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.

We have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.

We can try a word that uses two new letters to test.

But if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

But if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.

But to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.

So PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.

PROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.

Common endings: for example, PRO + L + Y? But Y is available, but PROLY is not a word.

PRO + B + E? E eliminated.

PRO + T + E? E eliminated.

PRO + W + L? PROWL.

PRO + F + T? Not a word.

Another word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.

What about ""PROSO""? Not a word.

I think PROWL is a good candidate.

But let's check if there are other words.

""PROLL"" is not a word.

""PROEM"" has E and M, eliminated.

""PROUD"" is out.

""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.

""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.

So, among the valid options, PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROOF has the advantage that if the word has a double O, we'll know, but if not, we get information on F.

Similarly, PROWL tests W and L.

But since we have limited guesses, and we want to cover more ground, perhaps PROWL is better because it uses two distinct new letters.

Also, L is a common letter.

PROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it's wrong, we might not learn as much.

Therefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.

But we must output the guess.

So, next guess: PROWL.

But let's confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.

Also, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn't have W or L, so we don't know.

So, I think it's fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.

### Key Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O is already placed but may repeat; other letters are untested for positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word starts with ""PRO"", so we need to guess the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., L, T, F, W).
- Possible valid words include ""PROWL"" (tests W and L), ""PROOF"" (tests double O and F), or ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y). ""PROWL"" is chosen because:
  - It uses two distinct, common letters (W and L) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids less common letters (like X and Y in ""PROXY"") and potential inefficiency of double letters (like in ""PROOF"").
- If ""PROWL"" is incorrect, feedback on W and L will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if W or L is present/absent).

But we don\'t know yet.\n\nWe need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.\n\nPROUD uses O,U,D.\n\nIf we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.\n\nBut any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.\n\nAnother common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.\n\nPROXY has X and Y, less common.\n\nSo I think PROUD is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PROUD.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): \n  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""prism""):\n  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.\n  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.\n  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.\n\nSecret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  \n\nEliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  \nAvailable letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  \n\n### Thought process for next guess:\n- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).\n- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.\n- Candidate words:\n  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.\n  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.\n  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.\n- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.\n\nNext guess: ""PROUD"".\n\n<guess>proud</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""prism""\n- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1\n- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n- M: absent (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".\n- I, S, M are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""proud""\n- P: correct (✓) at position 1\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- O: correct (✓) at position 3\n- U: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n\nSo, now we know:\n- The word is ""P R O _ _""\n- U and D are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nEliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.\n\nThe word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.\n\nBut note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nSo, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven\'t seen any repeats, and we don\'t have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.\n\nBut in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O\'s? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn\'t say anything about other O\'s. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.\n\nNow, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:\n\n- PROWL\n- PROOF\n- PROBE (but E is eliminated)\n- PROSE (S eliminated)\n- PRONE (N and E eliminated)\n- PRICE (C and E eliminated)\n- PRANK (A and N eliminated)\n- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)\n- PROXY\n\nLooking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.\n\nPROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.\n\nPROOF: O and F. But it has two O\'s? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.\n\nBut we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn\'t prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn\'t have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don\'t know about position 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about O.\n\nSo PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it\'s allowed.\n\nBut in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don\'t know if the secret word has a second O.\n\nSimilarly, F is available.\n\nBut we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn\'t contain them.\n\nAnother word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.\n\nPRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.\n\nOther words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.\n\nSo possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).\n\nAlso, PROLL? Not a word.\n\nPROUD is out because U and D are absent.\n\nSo let\'s list valid words:\n\n- PROWL: uses W and L\n- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)\n- PROXY: uses X and Y\n- PROBS? Not a word.\n- PROBE: E eliminated.\n- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.\n\nWhat about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.\n\nPROTE? Not common.\n\nAnother one: PROAS? Not common.\n\nI think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\nNow, we need to choose one that gives us information.\n\nBut note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.\n\nWe can try a word that uses two new letters to test.\n\nBut if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.\n\nSimilarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.\n\nBut if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.\n\nBut to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.\n\nSo PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.\n\nPROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.\n\nCommon endings: for example, PRO + L + Y? But Y is available, but PROLY is not a word.\n\nPRO + B + E? E eliminated.\n\nPRO + T + E? E eliminated.\n\nPRO + W + L? PROWL.\n\nPRO + F + T? Not a word.\n\nAnother word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.\n\nWhat about ""PROSO""? Not a word.\n\nI think PROWL is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\n""PROLL"" is not a word.\n\n""PROEM"" has E and M, eliminated.\n\n""PROUD"" is out.\n\n""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.\n\n""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.\n\nSo, among the valid options, PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\nNow, PROOF has the advantage that if the word has a double O, we\'ll know, but if not, we get information on F.\n\nSimilarly, PROWL tests W and L.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, and we want to cover more ground, perhaps PROWL is better because it uses two distinct new letters.\n\nAlso, L is a common letter.\n\nPROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it\'s wrong, we might not learn as much.\n\nTherefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.\n\nBut we must output the guess.\n\nSo, next guess: PROWL.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".\n\nIf correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.\n\nAlso, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn\'t have W or L, so we don\'t know.\n\nSo, I think it\'s fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).\n- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O is already placed but may repeat; other letters are untested for positions 4 and 5).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The word starts with ""PRO"", so we need to guess the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., L, T, F, W).\n- Possible valid words include ""PROWL"" (tests W and L), ""PROOF"" (tests double O and F), or ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y). ""PROWL"" is chosen because:\n  - It uses two distinct, common letters (W and L) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n  - It avoids less common letters (like X and Y in ""PROXY"") and potential inefficiency of double letters (like in ""PROOF"").\n- If ""PROWL"" is incorrect, feedback on W and L will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if W or L is present/absent).\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (first letter)
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- M: absent

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct and in position (third letter)
- U: absent
- D: absent

So after three guesses, we know:
- The secret word is ""P R O _ _""
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D

Guess 4: ""prowl""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct (third letter)
- W: absent
- L: absent

New information: W and L are absent.

Now, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Secret word pattern: ""P R O _ _""

We need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the eliminated set and form a valid English word.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

But note that O, P, R are already in the word at specific positions. We can reuse them if appropriate, but since positions 1-3 are fixed, and we're guessing 4-5, we need letters that haven't been used if possible? Actually, the word could have repeated letters. For example, O might appear again? But in ""proud"", O was only at position 3, and we didn't test other positions with O. Similarly, ""prowl"" didn't have O in position 4 or 5.

Possible words starting with ""PRO"":

Common endings: We need to consider words that end with two letters from the available set.

Options:
- PROOF: ends with O and F. But O is already in the word? ""PROOF"" would be P-R-O-O-F. So position 4 is O? We don't know if O can be at position 4. Available letters: O and F are both available (O was tested at position 3, but could be at 4). However, we haven't eliminated O, so it could appear twice? But we must test.

But ""PROOF"" has two O's. Is that possible? We need to check if it fits the feedback.

Feedback so far hasn't indicated any duplicate letters, so it's possible.

But ""prowl"" had L and W absent, and ""proof"" uses O and F.

Other options:
- PROBE: but E is eliminated.
- PRONE: N and E eliminated, out.
- PROSE: S eliminated.
- PRICE: C and E eliminated.

With available letters:

- PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y, uses X and Y.
- PROFY? Not a word.
- PROGS? Slang, but might be accepted? Not ideal.
- PROSY: S eliminated.
- PROLE: E eliminated.
- PROUD: U and D eliminated.
- PROWL: just tried, W and L eliminated.

Other possibilities: 
- PROSO? Not a word.
- PROVY? Not common.
- PROKE? Not common.

Valid words might include:
- PROOF: P-R-O-O-F
- PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y
- PROSY: but has S, eliminated.
- PRONK: N eliminated.

What about ""PRO""? with other endings:

- PROB is 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: has to be of form PROab where a and b are letters not eliminated.

Perhaps ""PROTO""? But T and O? ""PROTO"" would be P-R-O-T-O. So P,R,O,T,O? Positions: 1:P,2:R,3:O,4:T,5:O. But O is repeated? And available.

""PROTO"" is a prefix meaning first, but it's used as a word sometimes? For example, in biology. We might consider it valid.

Similarly, ""PROUD"" is tried and eliminated.

Another word: ""PROAS""? A type of boat? But has A eliminated? ""PROAS"" has A and S? Proa: PROA is 4 letters? PROAS might be plural? Let's check.

Acceptable? PROAS: P-R-O-A-S — A and S are eliminated? A is from ""crane"" marked absent, S from ""prism"" absent. So no.

Focus: ""PROOF"", ""PROXY"", ""PROTO"".

""PROTO"": P-R-O-T-O. So it ends with T and O.

Available letters: T and O are available? T hasn't been eliminated? And O is available.

But O is already at position 3, so if ""PROTO"" is secret word, positions 4 and 5: T and O.

In feedback from earlier guesses:
- ""crane"" didn't have O? Because it had O? No, ""crane"" had C R A N E — O wasn't tested. Only in ""proud"" we tested O at position 3, but not at other positions.

Similarly, ""prism"" didn't have O.

So O could be at position 5? And T at position 4.

Similarly, ""PROOF"" has O at 4 and F at 5.

Now, eliminated letters: with ""prowl"", L and W absent, so add to absent: L,W.

So eliminated: C,A,N,E,I,S,M,U,D,W,L

So available: B,F,G,H,K,O,Q,T,V,X,Y,Z

Now for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- PROOF: with O at 4 and F at 5.
- PROTO: with T at 4 and O at 5. But O at 5? Not ""PROTO"" — PROTO would be positions: 1P,2R,3O,4T,5O — so O at 5 is repeated.
- PROXY: with X at 4 and Y at 5.
- PROVT? Not a word.
- PROGY? Not a word.
- PROBB? No.

Another word: ""PROUD"" tried.

What about ""PROUD"" is out.

""PROMO"" has M and O, but M eliminated.

""PRONTO"" — too long.

Perhaps ""PRO"" combinations: I think PROOF and PROXY are main.

Also, ""PROBE"" E out.

But let's consider ""PROKE""? Not common.

""PROTY""? Not a word.

So probably the common ones are PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROTO might be acceptable? In some dictionaries. Let's assume it is fair.

But in Wordle, they use common words. PROTO might not be in the word list.

If not, then PROOF or PROXY.

PROXY: letters X and Y are less common, so if we guess PROOF, we test O and F.

But O might be duplicated? We don't know.

Since we have only two possibilities? No, there might be others.

Another word: ""PROSO""? Not.

""PROGR""? No.

""PROKF""? No.

What about ""PROFH""? No.

Perhaps ""PROGS"" if considered, but doubtful.

Then there's ""PROSE"" but S eliminated.

I think we should consider PROOF first.

But let's note: we have 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We can try PROOF.

If not, then PROXY.

But we should consider if there are other words.

For example, ""GROWL"" but starts with G, wrong.

The pattern must start with PRO.

Another word: ""PROVE"", but E eliminated.

""PROPS"" has S eliminated.

So indeed limited options.

Perhaps ""PROB"" with Y? ""PROBY""? Not a word.

""PROLY""? Not common.

Therefore, we have to choose between PROOF and PROXY, and PROOF is more common.

PROOF: uses O and F.

If we guess PROOF and it's wrong, feedback will show:

Position 1: P ✓
Position 2: R ✓
Position 3: O ✓
Position 4: O? If O is at position 4, it might be marked correct? Or if the word has only one O, but O is at 3, then the O at 4 might be absent? But since O was correct at 3, if the word has only one O, the second O would be absent.

Similarly, F at position 5, if present, etc.

But it will give information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that introduces completely new letters to test, but since positions 4 and 5 are unknown, and we have to stick to the prefix PRO.

So I think PROOF is a good guess.

Then, if not, we can try PROXY.

But let's make the guess.

So I'll go with ""PROOF"".
</think>
After reviewing the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step thought process for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Analyze Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in the second position. C, A, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in the first position, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, O are correct and in positions 1 and 3 (R was already confirmed). U, D are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""prowl"")**: P, R, O are confirmed correct in positions 1–3. W, L are absent.
   - **Current Known Pattern**: The secret word is **P R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as P, R, O).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L (not in the word at all).

2. **Deduce Constraints**:
   - Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available pool: B, F, G, H, K, O, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.
   - The word must start with ""PRO"" and be a valid English word.
   - Since repeated letters are possible (as no feedback indicates duplicates), O or other letters could appear again.

3. **Generate Valid Words**:
   - Common words matching ""PRO"" pattern:
     - ""PROOF"" (tests O at position 4 and F at position 5; both letters not yet tested).
     - ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y; less common letters).
     - ""PROTO"" (tests T and O; ""PROTO"" is niche/technical but might be valid).
     - ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" have been guessed and eliminated.
     - Other combinations (e.g., ""PROSE"", ""PRONE"") contain eliminated letters and are invalid.

4. **Select Optimal Guess**:
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., F, T) to maximize information.
   - ""PROOF"" is chosen because:
       - It tests two new letters (O and F), which are common and impactful.
       - If incorrect, feedback on O (position 4) and F (position 5) will quickly narrow options (e.g., reveal duplicates, positions, or eliminate F).
       - ""PROXY"" (X, Y) and ""PROTO"" (T, O) are backups if needed.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - With 2 guesses remaining (after this), feedback from ""PROOF"" will likely solve the word quickly or reveal all letters.

<guess>proof</guess>",proof,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- A: absent
- N: absent

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (first letter)
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- M: absent

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct and in position (third letter)
- U: absent
- D: absent

So after three guesses, we know:
- The secret word is ""P R O _ _""
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D

Guess 4: ""prowl""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct (third letter)
- W: absent
- L: absent

New information: W and L are absent.

Now, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Secret word pattern: ""P R O _ _""

We need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the eliminated set and form a valid English word.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

But note that O, P, R are already in the word at specific positions. We can reuse them if appropriate, but since positions 1-3 are fixed, and we're guessing 4-5, we need letters that haven't been used if possible? Actually, the word could have repeated letters. For example, O might appear again? But in ""proud"", O was only at position 3, and we didn't test other positions with O. Similarly, ""prowl"" didn't have O in position 4 or 5.

Possible words starting with ""PRO"":

Common endings: We need to consider words that end with two letters from the available set.

Available letters: O and F are both available (O was tested at position 3, but could be at 4). However, we haven't eliminated O, so it could appear twice? But we must test.

But ""PROOF"" has two O's. Is that possible? We need to check if it fits the feedback.

Feedback so far hasn't indicated any duplicate letters, so it's possible.

But ""prowl"" had L and W absent, and ""proof"" uses O and F.

Other options:

- PROUD: U and D eliminated.
- PROWL: just tried, W and L eliminated.

Other possibilities: 
- PROSO? Not a word.

Valid words might include:
- PROOF: P-R-O-O-F

- PRONK: N eliminated.

What about ""PRO""? with other endings:

- PROB is 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: has to be of form PROab where a and b are letters not eliminated.

Perhaps ""PROTO""? But T and O? ""PROTO"" would be P-R-O-T-O. So P,R,O,T,O? Positions: 1:P,2:R,3:O,4:T,5:O. But O is repeated? And available.

""PROTO"" is a prefix meaning first, but it's used as a word sometimes? For example, in biology. We might consider it valid.

Similarly, ""PROUD"" is tried and eliminated.

Another word: ""PROAS""? A type of boat? But has A eliminated? ""PROAS"" has A and S? Proa: PROA is 4 letters? PROAS might be plural? Let's check.

Acceptable? PROAS: P-R-O-A-S — A and S are eliminated? A is from ""crane"" marked absent, S from ""prism"" absent. So no.

Focus: ""PROOF"", ""PROXY"", ""PROTO"".

""PROTO"": P-R-O-T-O. So it ends with T and O.

Available letters: T and O are available? T hasn't been eliminated? And O is available.

But O is already at position 3, so if ""PROTO"" is secret word, positions 4 and 5: T and O.

In feedback from earlier guesses:
- ""crane"" didn't have O? Because it had O? No, ""crane"" had C R A N E — O wasn't tested. Only in ""proud"" we tested O at position 3, but not at other positions.

Similarly, ""prism"" didn't have O.

So O could be at position 5? And T at position 4.

Similarly, ""PROOF"" has O at 4 and F at 5.

Now, eliminated letters: with ""prowl"", L and W absent, so add to absent: L,W.

So eliminated: C,A,N,E,I,S,M,U,D,W,L

So available: B,F,G,H,K,O,Q,T,V,X,Y,Z

Now for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- PROOF: with O at 4 and F at 5.
- PROTO: with T at 4 and O at 5. But O at 5? Not ""PROTO"" — PROTO would be positions: 1P,2R,3O,4T,5O — so O at 5 is repeated.
- PROXY: with X at 4 and Y at 5.
- PROVT? Not a word.
- PROGY? Not a word.
- PROBB? No.

Another word: ""PROUD"" tried.

What about ""PROUD"" is out.

""PROMO"" has M and O, but M eliminated.

""PRONTO"" — too long.

Perhaps ""PRO"" combinations: I think PROOF and PROXY are main.

Also, ""PROBE"" E out.

But let's consider ""PROKE""? Not common.

""PROTY""? Not a word.

So probably the common ones are PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROTO might be acceptable? In some dictionaries. Let's assume it is fair.

But in Wordle, they use common words. PROTO might not be in the word list.

If not, then PROOF or PROXY.

PROXY: letters X and Y are less common, so if we guess PROOF, we test O and F.

But O might be duplicated? We don't know.

Since we have only two possibilities? No, there might be others.

Another word: ""PROSO""? Not.

""PROGR""? No.

""PROKF""? No.

What about ""PROFH""? No.

Perhaps ""PROGS"" if considered, but doubtful.

Then there's ""PROSE"" but S eliminated.

I think we should consider PROOF first.

But let's note: we have 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We can try PROOF.

If not, then PROXY.

But we should consider if there are other words.

For example, ""GROWL"" but starts with G, wrong.

The pattern must start with PRO.

Another word: ""PROVE"", but E eliminated.

""PROPS"" has S eliminated.

So indeed limited options.

Perhaps ""PROB"" with Y? ""PROBY""? Not a word.

""PROLY""? Not common.

Therefore, we have to choose between PROOF and PROXY, and PROOF is more common.

PROOF: uses O and F.

If we guess PROOF and it's wrong, feedback will show:

Position 1: P ✓
Position 2: R ✓
Position 3: O ✓
Position 4: O? If O is at position 4, it might be marked correct? Or if the word has only one O, but O is at 3, then the O at 4 might be absent? But since O was correct at 3, if the word has only one O, the second O would be absent.

Similarly, F at position 5, if present, etc.

But it will give information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that introduces completely new letters to test, but since positions 4 and 5 are unknown, and we have to stick to the prefix PRO.

So I think PROOF is a good guess.

Then, if not, we can try PROXY.

But let's make the guess.

So I'll go with ""PROOF"".After reviewing the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step thought process for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Analyze Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in the second position. C, A, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in the first position, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, O are correct and in positions 1 and 3 (R was already confirmed). U, D are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""prowl"")**: P, R, O are confirmed correct in positions 1–3. W, L are absent.
   - **Current Known Pattern**: The secret word is **P R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as P, R, O).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L (not in the word at all).

2. **Deduce Constraints**:
   - Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available pool: B, F, G, H, K, O, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.
   - The word must start with ""PRO"" and be a valid English word.
   - Since repeated letters are possible (as no feedback indicates duplicates), O or other letters could appear again.

3. **Generate Valid Words**:
   - Common words matching ""PRO"" pattern:
     - ""PROOF"" (tests O at position 4 and F at position 5; both letters not yet tested).
     - ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y; less common letters).
     - ""PROTO"" (tests T and O; ""PROTO"" is niche/technical but might be valid).
     - ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" have been guessed and eliminated.
     - Other combinations (e.g., ""PROSE"", ""PRONE"") contain eliminated letters and are invalid.

4. **Select Optimal Guess**:
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., F, T) to maximize information.
   - ""PROOF"" is chosen because:
       - It tests two new letters (O and F), which are common and impactful.
       - If incorrect, feedback on O (position 4) and F (position 5) will quickly narrow options (e.g., reveal duplicates, positions, or eliminate F).
       - ""PROXY"" (X, Y) and ""PROTO"" (T, O) are backups if needed.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - With 2 guesses remaining (after this), feedback from ""PROOF"" will likely solve the word quickly or reveal all letters.",Guess 5: proof -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) F(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English 5-letter words (besides the ones we've eliminated) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- TRYST (but T is repeated, might not be ideal for information)
- PROUD (has P, R, O, U, D)
- GROUT (G, R, O, U, T)
- BROIL (B, R, O, I, L)
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T)

We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

Also, note that we have only one correct letter so far (R in position 2). We need to test other positions.

Let me consider ""BROIL"":
- B: new letter, in position 1
- R: known, in position 2
- O: new letter, in position 3
- I: new letter, in position 4
- L: new letter, in position 5

This tests four new letters (B, O, I, L) and avoids the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""PROUD"":
- P: new, position 1
- R: known, position 2
- O: new, position 3
- U: new, position 4
- D: new, position 5

Also tests four new letters.

But note: we don't know if the word has repeated letters, but since we are avoiding known absent letters, we can choose any valid word.

Another common word is ""SPRIT"" (but S is common) or ""GRIMY"".

However, we must ensure the word is valid.

I think ""BROIL"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and might help us narrow down.

But let me check if there are other words that might cover more common letters.

Another option: ""TRYST"" has T and S, but T is repeated. Not ideal.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M. This has S and M, which are common.

But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. PRISM doesn't have those.

PRISM: 
- P: position 1
- R: position 2 (correct)
- I: position 3
- S: position 4
- M: position 5

This tests P, I, S, M.

Similarly, ""DRUID"" has D, R, U, I, D (repeated D) - not ideal.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate.

But let me also consider ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T. This tests F, U, I, T.

We don't have a strong preference, but we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters (after E, A, R, which we already have some info on) are: O, I, T, N, S, L, etc. But we know N is out, so O, I, T, S, L.

So, a word that includes O, I, T, S, L would be good, but we have to have R in the second position.

Possible words: 
- ""TROIS"" (but T is first, and we have R second, then O, I, S) - but TROIS is a valid word? It means three in French, but might be accepted.
- ""GROSS"" (G, R, O, S, S) - repeated S.

Alternatively, ""BROWS"" (B, R, O, W, S) - but W is less common.

I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice because it uses P, R, I, S, M, and these are fairly common.

But note: we have already ruled out A, C, E, N. So we can use any other letters.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so we cannot use C.

So, I'll go with ""PRISM"".

But wait, let me confirm: the feedback for ""crane"" said R is correct and in position, and the others are absent. So we are safe to use PRISM.

So, my next guess is ""PRISM"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

So, the guess is ""prism"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the secret word and correctly placed in the second position.

The secret word pattern is: _ R _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have R in the second position.
- Avoid using C, A, N, E.
- Include other common letters to test new positions (e.g., S, T, I, O, M, P).

A strong candidate is ""PRISM"":
- Tests P (position 1), I (position 3), S (position 4), and M (position 5).
- Uses common letters to maximize information.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

<guess>prism</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>After the first guess ""crane"", we got feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x). This means:
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

So secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _

For the second guess, I chose ""prism"". Feedback: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x). This means:
- P is in the secret word and in the correct position (first letter).
- R is correct and in position (we already knew that).
- I, S, M are not in the secret word.

New information:
- P is the first letter and R is the second, so the secret word starts with PR.
- I, S, M are not in the word, so we can eliminate these letters.
- Previously eliminated: C, A, N, E.

Current eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M.

Secret word pattern: P R _ _ _

We need to find a word that starts with PR, doesn't contain any eliminated letters, and tests other positions.

Possible letters: after eliminating C,A,N,E,I,S,M, we have remaining letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common ones.

Common vowels left are O, U; consonants B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, etc.

The word must be PR followed by three other letters, none of which are eliminated.

We need to guess words that help identify the remaining letters. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, we should include common letters to test.

Possible words starting with PR: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PRODS, PROLE, PROSY, etc. But must be 5 letters and valid.

Let's consider:
- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)
- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)
- PRONG (P,R,O,N,G) — but N is eliminated, can't use.
- PRANK — has A and N, eliminated.
- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.
- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.
- PROBE — has E, eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.

PROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.
PROWL: uses O,W,L.
PROXY: uses O,X,Y.
BROTH — but starts with B, not PR.

More words: 
- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.
- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.
- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.
- PLUME — but starts with PL, not PR.

After eliminating letters, common words might be:
- PROUD
- PROWL
- PROXY
- PRUDE (but E is out, so invalid? PRUDE has E? Wait: PRUDE ends with E, and E is eliminated because ""crane"" E was marked x, meaning no E in word. So cannot use E.

Similarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.

So PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.

But PROUD: P,R,O,U,D. O,U,D are new letters.

Similarly, GROWL but starts with G, wrong first letter.

Our pattern is fixed: must start with PR.

So only words beginning with PR.

Other options: PROLE — not very common, and has E? PROLE: P,R,O,L,E — E eliminated, so no.
PROSE — has S, eliminated.
PRONE — has N,E, eliminated.
PRIME — has I,M, eliminated.
PRESS — has S,S.

So PROUD seems good? Or perhaps PROWL.

Another: PROOF — but O repeated? And has F? PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. Double O, which might be okay if O is in word, but we don't know.

But we want to test different letters.

PRONG has N, eliminated.

I think PROUD is a common word. Also, PRUDE has E, but E is out, so not.

What about PRYER? But R is repeated? PRYER: P,R,Y,E,R — has E, eliminated.

Focus on words without eliminated letters.

Allowable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common combinations: PRO_ _, so third letter often vowel like O.

Possible words:
- PROUD: P,R,O,U,D
- PROWL: P,R,O,W,L
- PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y — less common letters.
- PROFS? Not a word.
- PROMO — but M and O, M eliminated? PROMO: P,R,O,M,O — M is eliminated, so no.
- PROSY? But S is eliminated, PROSY has S, from S in sys? PROSY is a word? Adjective meaning tedious or commonplace, but has S.

How about PROBE? But E is eliminated.

PROTE — not common word.

PRATT? Has T,T, but P,R,A,T,T — A is eliminated.

So best bet might be PROUD or PROWL.

PROUD tests O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.

PROWL tests O in 3, W in 4, L in 5.

We don't know if vowels are needed. Remaining vowels are O,U, and sometimes Y.

Y could be used, e.g., PRY or words like PRYER but has E.

Perhaps BROOD? But starts with B, incorrect.

Must start with P R.

Another word: PROGS — not common.

PROKE? Not common.

Perhaps PRESS? But S eliminated.

So among valid options, PROUD is valid and common. Let's go with that.

But is there a word with more common letters? Like T or something, but third position.

For example, PRUTE? Not a word.

PROPER? But longer and repeats P.

No, 5 letters: PRO something.

PRANK? A eliminated.

I think PROUD is fine.

Perhaps GROWL is not right—must start PR.

Another word: PRIED? But I eliminated.

So, I'll choose PROUD.

But let's confirm feedback possibilities.

If secret word is PROUD, we get all correct? But we don't know yet.

We need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.

PROUD uses O,U,D.

If we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.

But any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.

Another common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.

PROXY has X and Y, less common.

So I think PROUD is a good choice.

Therefore, next guess: PROUD.Based on the previous feedback:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From Guess 2 (""prism""):
  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.
  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.
  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.

Secret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  

Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  
Available letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  

### Thought process for next guess:
- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.
- Candidate words:
  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.
  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.
  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.
- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.

Next guess: ""PROUD"".

<guess>proud</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
Guess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1
- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- M: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".
- I, S, M are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- O: correct (✓) at position 3
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)

So, now we know:
- The word is ""P R O _ _""
- U and D are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.

The word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.

But note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.

So, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

However, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven't seen any repeats, and we don't have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.

But in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O's? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn't say anything about other O's. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.

Now, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:

- PROWL
- PROOF
- PROBE (but E is eliminated)
- PROSE (S eliminated)
- PRONE (N and E eliminated)
- PRICE (C and E eliminated)
- PRANK (A and N eliminated)
- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)
- PROXY

Looking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.

PROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.

PROOF: O and F. But it has two O's? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.

But we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn't prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn't have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don't know about position 4.

Similarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn't tell us about O.

So PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it's allowed.

But in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don't know if the secret word has a second O.

Similarly, F is available.

But we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn't contain them.

Another word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.

PRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.

Other words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.

So possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).

Also, PROLL? Not a word.

PROUD is out because U and D are absent.

So let's list valid words:

- PROWL: uses W and L
- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)
- PROXY: uses X and Y
- PROBS? Not a word.
- PROBE: E eliminated.
- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.

What about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.

PROTE? Not common.

Another one: PROAS? Not common.

I think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, we need to choose one that gives us information.

But note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.

We have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.

We can try a word that uses two new letters to test.

But if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.

Similarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

But if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.

But to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.

So PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.

PROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.

Common endings: for example, PRO + L + Y? But Y is available, but PROLY is not a word.

PRO + B + E? E eliminated.

PRO + T + E? E eliminated.

PRO + W + L? PROWL.

PRO + F + T? Not a word.

Another word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.

What about ""PROSO""? Not a word.

I think PROWL is a good candidate.

But let's check if there are other words.

""PROLL"" is not a word.

""PROEM"" has E and M, eliminated.

""PROUD"" is out.

""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.

""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.

So, among the valid options, PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROOF has the advantage that if the word has a double O, we'll know, but if not, we get information on F.

Similarly, PROWL tests W and L.

But since we have limited guesses, and we want to cover more ground, perhaps PROWL is better because it uses two distinct new letters.

Also, L is a common letter.

PROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it's wrong, we might not learn as much.

Therefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.

But we must output the guess.

So, next guess: PROWL.

But let's confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".

If correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.

Also, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn't have W or L, so we don't know.

So, I think it's fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.

### Key Information:
- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O is already placed but may repeat; other letters are untested for positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word starts with ""PRO"", so we need to guess the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., L, T, F, W).
- Possible valid words include ""PROWL"" (tests W and L), ""PROOF"" (tests double O and F), or ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y). ""PROWL"" is chosen because:
  - It uses two distinct, common letters (W and L) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids less common letters (like X and Y in ""PROXY"") and potential inefficiency of double letters (like in ""PROOF"").
- If ""PROWL"" is incorrect, feedback on W and L will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if W or L is present/absent).

<guess>prowl</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)
Guess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: absent

Guess 2: ""prism""
- P: correct and in position (first letter)
- R: correct and in position (second letter)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- M: absent

Guess 3: ""proud""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct and in position (third letter)
- U: absent
- D: absent

So after three guesses, we know:
- The secret word is ""P R O _ _""
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D

Guess 4: ""prowl""
- P: correct (first letter)
- R: correct (second letter)
- O: correct (third letter)
- W: absent
- L: absent

New information: W and L are absent.

Now, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Secret word pattern: ""P R O _ _""

We need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the eliminated set and form a valid English word.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

But note that O, P, R are already in the word at specific positions. We can reuse them if appropriate, but since positions 1-3 are fixed, and we're guessing 4-5, we need letters that haven't been used if possible? Actually, the word could have repeated letters. For example, O might appear again? But in ""proud"", O was only at position 3, and we didn't test other positions with O. Similarly, ""prowl"" didn't have O in position 4 or 5.

Possible words starting with ""PRO"":

Common endings: We need to consider words that end with two letters from the available set.

Options:
- PROOF: ends with O and F. But O is already in the word? ""PROOF"" would be P-R-O-O-F. So position 4 is O? We don't know if O can be at position 4. Available letters: O and F are both available (O was tested at position 3, but could be at 4). However, we haven't eliminated O, so it could appear twice? But we must test.

But ""PROOF"" has two O's. Is that possible? We need to check if it fits the feedback.

Feedback so far hasn't indicated any duplicate letters, so it's possible.

But ""prowl"" had L and W absent, and ""proof"" uses O and F.

Other options:
- PROBE: but E is eliminated.
- PRONE: N and E eliminated, out.
- PROSE: S eliminated.
- PRICE: C and E eliminated.

With available letters:

- PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y, uses X and Y.
- PROFY? Not a word.
- PROGS? Slang, but might be accepted? Not ideal.
- PROSY: S eliminated.
- PROLE: E eliminated.
- PROUD: U and D eliminated.
- PROWL: just tried, W and L eliminated.

Other possibilities: 
- PROSO? Not a word.
- PROVY? Not common.
- PROKE? Not common.

Valid words might include:
- PROOF: P-R-O-O-F
- PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y
- PROSY: but has S, eliminated.
- PRONK: N eliminated.

What about ""PRO""? with other endings:

- PROB is 4 letters.
- 5-letter words: has to be of form PROab where a and b are letters not eliminated.

Perhaps ""PROTO""? But T and O? ""PROTO"" would be P-R-O-T-O. So P,R,O,T,O? Positions: 1:P,2:R,3:O,4:T,5:O. But O is repeated? And available.

""PROTO"" is a prefix meaning first, but it's used as a word sometimes? For example, in biology. We might consider it valid.

Similarly, ""PROUD"" is tried and eliminated.

Another word: ""PROAS""? A type of boat? But has A eliminated? ""PROAS"" has A and S? Proa: PROA is 4 letters? PROAS might be plural? Let's check.

Acceptable? PROAS: P-R-O-A-S — A and S are eliminated? A is from ""crane"" marked absent, S from ""prism"" absent. So no.

Focus: ""PROOF"", ""PROXY"", ""PROTO"".

""PROTO"": P-R-O-T-O. So it ends with T and O.

Available letters: T and O are available? T hasn't been eliminated? And O is available.

But O is already at position 3, so if ""PROTO"" is secret word, positions 4 and 5: T and O.

In feedback from earlier guesses:
- ""crane"" didn't have O? Because it had O? No, ""crane"" had C R A N E — O wasn't tested. Only in ""proud"" we tested O at position 3, but not at other positions.

Similarly, ""prism"" didn't have O.

So O could be at position 5? And T at position 4.

Similarly, ""PROOF"" has O at 4 and F at 5.

Now, eliminated letters: with ""prowl"", L and W absent, so add to absent: L,W.

So eliminated: C,A,N,E,I,S,M,U,D,W,L

So available: B,F,G,H,K,O,Q,T,V,X,Y,Z

Now for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- PROOF: with O at 4 and F at 5.
- PROTO: with T at 4 and O at 5. But O at 5? Not ""PROTO"" — PROTO would be positions: 1P,2R,3O,4T,5O — so O at 5 is repeated.
- PROXY: with X at 4 and Y at 5.
- PROVT? Not a word.
- PROGY? Not a word.
- PROBB? No.

Another word: ""PROUD"" tried.

What about ""PROUD"" is out.

""PROMO"" has M and O, but M eliminated.

""PRONTO"" — too long.

Perhaps ""PRO"" combinations: I think PROOF and PROXY are main.

Also, ""PROBE"" E out.

But let's consider ""PROKE""? Not common.

""PROTY""? Not a word.

So probably the common ones are PROOF, PROXY.

Now, PROTO might be acceptable? In some dictionaries. Let's assume it is fair.

But in Wordle, they use common words. PROTO might not be in the word list.

If not, then PROOF or PROXY.

PROXY: letters X and Y are less common, so if we guess PROOF, we test O and F.

But O might be duplicated? We don't know.

Since we have only two possibilities? No, there might be others.

Another word: ""PROSO""? Not.

""PROGR""? No.

""PROKF""? No.

What about ""PROFH""? No.

Perhaps ""PROGS"" if considered, but doubtful.

Then there's ""PROSE"" but S eliminated.

I think we should consider PROOF first.

But let's note: we have 6 guesses, and this is guess 5.

We can try PROOF.

If not, then PROXY.

But we should consider if there are other words.

For example, ""GROWL"" but starts with G, wrong.

The pattern must start with PRO.

Another word: ""PROVE"", but E eliminated.

""PROPS"" has S eliminated.

So indeed limited options.

Perhaps ""PROB"" with Y? ""PROBY""? Not a word.

""PROLY""? Not common.

Therefore, we have to choose between PROOF and PROXY, and PROOF is more common.

PROOF: uses O and F.

If we guess PROOF and it's wrong, feedback will show:

Position 1: P ✓
Position 2: R ✓
Position 3: O ✓
Position 4: O? If O is at position 4, it might be marked correct? Or if the word has only one O, but O is at 3, then the O at 4 might be absent? But since O was correct at 3, if the word has only one O, the second O would be absent.

Similarly, F at position 5, if present, etc.

But it will give information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that introduces completely new letters to test, but since positions 4 and 5 are unknown, and we have to stick to the prefix PRO.

So I think PROOF is a good guess.

Then, if not, we can try PROXY.

But let's make the guess.

So I'll go with ""PROOF"".After reviewing the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the step-by-step thought process for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
1. **Analyze Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in the second position. C, A, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in the first position, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, O are correct and in positions 1 and 3 (R was already confirmed). U, D are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (""prowl"")**: P, R, O are confirmed correct in positions 1–3. W, L are absent.
   - **Current Known Pattern**: The secret word is **P R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as P, R, O).
   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L (not in the word at all).

2. **Deduce Constraints**:
   - Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available pool: B, F, G, H, K, O, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.
   - The word must start with ""PRO"" and be a valid English word.
   - Since repeated letters are possible (as no feedback indicates duplicates), O or other letters could appear again.

3. **Generate Valid Words**:
   - Common words matching ""PRO"" pattern:
     - ""PROOF"" (tests O at position 4 and F at position 5; both letters not yet tested).
     - ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y; less common letters).
     - ""PROTO"" (tests T and O; ""PROTO"" is niche/technical but might be valid).
     - ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" have been guessed and eliminated.
     - Other combinations (e.g., ""PROSE"", ""PRONE"") contain eliminated letters and are invalid.

4. **Select Optimal Guess**:
   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., F, T) to maximize information.
   - ""PROOF"" is chosen because:
       - It tests two new letters (O and F), which are common and impactful.
       - If incorrect, feedback on O (position 4) and F (position 5) will quickly narrow options (e.g., reveal duplicates, positions, or eliminate F).
       - ""PROXY"" (X, Y) and ""PROTO"" (T, O) are backups if needed.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - With 2 guesses remaining (after this), feedback from ""PROOF"" will likely solve the word quickly or reveal all letters.

But we should focus on common ones.\n\nCommon vowels left are O, U; consonants B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, etc.\n\nThe word must be PR followed by three other letters, none of which are eliminated.\n\nWe need to guess words that help identify the remaining letters. Since positions 3,4,5 are unknown, we should include common letters to test.\n\nPossible words starting with PR: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY, PRODS, PROLE, PROSY, etc. But must be 5 letters and valid.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n- PROUD (P,R,O,U,D)\n- PROWL (P,R,O,W,L)\n- PRONG (P,R,O,N,G) — but N is eliminated, can\'t use.\n- PRANK — has A and N, eliminated.\n- PRESS — has S and S, eliminated.\n- PRIZE — has I and Z, I eliminated.\n- PROBE — has E, eliminated.\n\nEliminated letters: C,A,N,E,I,S,M. So avoid these.\n\nPROUD: uses O,U,D — all allowed.\nPROWL: uses O,W,L.\nPROXY: uses O,X,Y.\nBROTH — but starts with B, not PR.\n\nMore words: \n- PRAWN — has A, eliminated.\n- PRUNE — has N,E, eliminated.\n- PRUDE — has U,D,E but E is eliminated? PRUDE: P,R,U,D,E — E is eliminated, so no.\n- PLUME — but starts with PL, not PR.\n\nAfter eliminating letters, common words might be:\n- PROUD\n- PROWL\n- PROXY\n- PRUDE (but E is out, so invalid? PRUDE has E? Wait: PRUDE ends with E, and E is eliminated because ""crane"" E was marked x, meaning no E in word. So cannot use E.\n\nSimilarly, cannot use I,S,M,A,C,N.\n\nSo PROUD is valid: letters P,R,O,U,D — all not eliminated? P and R are in word but we can still use them since they are correct, and the word might have repeated letters? But in feedback, P and R are fixed, so for other positions, we can use any allowed letters.\n\nBut PROUD: P,R,O,U,D. O,U,D are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, GROWL but starts with G, wrong first letter.\n\nOur pattern is fixed: must start with PR.\n\nSo only words beginning with PR.\n\nOther options: PROLE — not very common, and has E? PROLE: P,R,O,L,E — E eliminated, so no.\nPROSE — has S, eliminated.\nPRONE — has N,E, eliminated.\nPRIME — has I,M, eliminated.\nPRESS — has S,S.\n\nSo PROUD seems good? Or perhaps PROWL.\n\nAnother: PROOF — but O repeated? And has F? PROOF: P,R,O,O,F. Double O, which might be okay if O is in word, but we don\'t know.\n\nBut we want to test different letters.\n\nPRONG has N, eliminated.\n\nI think PROUD is a common word. Also, PRUDE has E, but E is out, so not.\n\nWhat about PRYER? But R is repeated? PRYER: P,R,Y,E,R — has E, eliminated.\n\nFocus on words without eliminated letters.\n\nAllowable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon combinations: PRO_ _, so third letter often vowel like O.\n\nPossible words:\n- PROUD: P,R,O,U,D\n- PROWL: P,R,O,W,L\n- PROXY: P,R,O,X,Y — less common letters.\n- PROFS? Not a word.\n- PROMO — but M and O, M eliminated? PROMO: P,R,O,M,O — M is eliminated, so no.\n- PROSY? But S is eliminated, PROSY has S, from S in sys? PROSY is a word? Adjective meaning tedious or commonplace, but has S.\n\nHow about PROBE? But E is eliminated.\n\nPROTE — not common word.\n\nPRATT? Has T,T, but P,R,A,T,T — A is eliminated.\n\nSo best bet might be PROUD or PROWL.\n\nPROUD tests O in position 3, U in position 4, D in position 5.\n\nPROWL tests O in 3, W in 4, L in 5.\n\nWe don\'t know if vowels are needed. Remaining vowels are O,U, and sometimes Y.\n\nY could be used, e.g., PRY or words like PRYER but has E.\n\nPerhaps BROOD? But starts with B, incorrect.\n\nMust start with P R.\n\nAnother word: PROGS — not common.\n\nPROKE? Not common.\n\nPerhaps PRESS? But S eliminated.\n\nSo among valid options, PROUD is valid and common. Let\'s go with that.\n\nBut is there a word with more common letters? Like T or something, but third position.\n\nFor example, PRUTE? Not a word.\n\nPROPER? But longer and repeats P.\n\nNo, 5 letters: PRO something.\n\nPRANK? A eliminated.\n\nI think PROUD is fine.\n\nPerhaps GROWL is not right—must start PR.\n\nAnother word: PRIED? But I eliminated.\n\nSo, I\'ll choose PROUD.\n\nBut let\'s confirm feedback possibilities.\n\nIf secret word is PROUD, we get all correct? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nWe need to test letters for positions 3,4,5.\n\nPROUD uses O,U,D.\n\nIf we guess PROUD and get feedback, position 3: probably not correct if word is different, etc.\n\nBut any word starting with PR with allowed letters is okay.\n\nAnother common word: ""PROOF"" but double O, which might not give max information.\n\nPROXY has X and Y, less common.\n\nSo I think PROUD is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PROUD.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): \n  - R is in the secret word and correctly placed as the second letter.\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- From Guess 2 (""prism""):\n  - P is in the secret word and correctly placed as the first letter.\n  - R (second letter) is confirmed correct.\n  - I, S, M are not in the secret word.\n\nSecret word pattern: **P R _ _ _**  \n\nEliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M**.  \nAvailable letters: **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**  \n\n### Thought process for next guess:\n- The secret word starts with ""PR"" and has three unknown positions (3, 4, 5).\n- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with ""PR"" that avoids eliminated letters and tests common unrevealed letters (like O, U, D, L, T) to maximize information.\n- Candidate words:\n  - ""PROUD"": Tests O (position 3), U (position 4), D (position 5). Common letters, and all allowed.\n  - ""PROWL"": Tests O (position 3), W (position 4), L (position 5). Less common than PROUD but valid.\n  - ""PROXY"": Tests O (position 3), X and Y (positions 4-5). X and Y are less common, reducing information potential.\n- ""PROUD"" (with common vowels U and O) is preferred to cover more frequent letters and new positions efficiently.\n\nNext guess: ""PROUD"".\n\n<guess>proud</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""prism""\n- P: correct and in position (✓) at position 1\n- R: correct and in position (✓) at position 2 (already known)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n- M: absent (x)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The first letter is P and second is R, so the word starts with ""PR"".\n- I, S, M are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""proud""\n- P: correct (✓) at position 1\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- O: correct (✓) at position 3\n- U: absent (x)\n- D: absent (x)\n\nSo, now we know:\n- The word is ""P R O _ _""\n- U and D are not in the word.\n\nAdditionally, from previous guesses, we have eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nEliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: O is in the word at position 3, and P and R are already placed. We can use these letters again in other positions? But in this case, since we are only missing positions 4 and 5, and we know the first three are P, R, O.\n\nThe word is ""PRO"" followed by two letters.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""PRO"", and the last two letters are from the available set, and not in the eliminated list.\n\nBut note: the eliminated letters are C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D.\n\nSo, the last two letters must be from: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that the word might have repeated letters. But so far, we haven\'t seen any repeats, and we don\'t have evidence for it. But we should not rule out the possibility.\n\nBut in our available letters, we have O, P, R, but since they are already placed, we can use them again? For example, if the word has two O\'s? But in ""proud"", O was at position 3 and correct, and U and D were absent. So if there were another O, it might have been flagged? The feedback for ""proud"" only said O is correct at position 3, and U and D absent. It doesn\'t say anything about other O\'s. But in Wordle, if a letter is repeated and one is correct, the others might be marked differently. However, in this case, ""proud"" has only one O, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume repeated letters unless necessary.\n\nNow, common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters:\n\n- PROWL\n- PROOF\n- PROBE (but E is eliminated)\n- PROSE (S eliminated)\n- PRONE (N and E eliminated)\n- PRICE (C and E eliminated)\n- PRANK (A and N eliminated)\n- PROUD (we tried, and U and D are out)\n- PROXY\n\nLooking at the eliminated letters, we can rule out many.\n\nPROWL: W and L, both are available. So ""PROWL"" is a candidate.\n\nPROOF: O and F. But it has two O\'s? PROOF: P-R-O-O-F. So positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:O, 5:F.\n\nBut we have O at position 3, and if we use PROOF, then position 4 is also O. Is that possible? The feedback from ""proud"" only showed that O is at position 3, but it doesn\'t prevent O from being at other positions. However, in ""proud"", we had O at 3 and U and D absent, but if there were an O at position 4, it might have been marked as present but wrong position? But in ""proud"", we didn\'t have an O at position 4, we had U. So we don\'t know about position 4.\n\nSimilarly, in ""prism"", we had I at position 3, which was absent, but that doesn\'t tell us about O.\n\nSo PROOF is a possibility? But we have to check if it\'s allowed.\n\nBut in PROOF, the letter O is repeated. In the feedback for ""proud"", since we only had one O (at position 3) and it was correct, and no other O was in the guess, so we don\'t know if the secret word has a second O.\n\nSimilarly, F is available.\n\nBut we have eliminated U and D, so PROOF doesn\'t contain them.\n\nAnother word: PROXY: P-R-O-X-Y. X and Y are available.\n\nPRO: P-R-O, then what? We need to fill the last two.\n\nOther words: PROLE (but E eliminated), PROSY (S eliminated), PROUD (tried), PRONG (N eliminated), etc.\n\nSo possible words with available letters: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY, and perhaps PROGS (if valid? not common), or PROKE (not common).\n\nAlso, PROLL? Not a word.\n\nPROUD is out because U and D are absent.\n\nSo let\'s list valid words:\n\n- PROWL: uses W and L\n- PROOF: uses O and F (with double O)\n- PROXY: uses X and Y\n- PROBS? Not a word.\n- PROBE: E eliminated.\n- PRYER? But has R and E, and E is out.\n\nWhat about PROST? Not a word, and S eliminated.\n\nPROTE? Not common.\n\nAnother one: PROAS? Not common.\n\nI think the common ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\nNow, we need to choose one that gives us information.\n\nBut note: we only have two positions to fill, so we are essentially trying to guess the last two letters.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is guess 4.\n\nWe can try a word that uses two new letters to test.\n\nBut if we guess PROWL, for example, we test W and L.\n\nSimilarly, PROOF tests F and also tests if there is a double O.\n\nBut if we guess PROOF and the word is PROWL, then we might get feedback that O is correct at 3, and F is absent, and the second O might be absent or wrong position? But since we placed it at 4, if the word has no O at 4, it would be marked absent.\n\nBut to maximize information, perhaps we should avoid double letters for now.\n\nSo PROWL and PROXY are without double letters.\n\nPROXY has X and Y, which are less common, so PROWL might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might be ""PRO"" + two common letters.\n\nCommon endings: for example, PRO + L + Y? But Y is available, but PROLY is not a word.\n\nPRO + B + E? E eliminated.\n\nPRO + T + E? E eliminated.\n\nPRO + W + L? PROWL.\n\nPRO + F + T? Not a word.\n\nAnother word: PROUD we tried, but U and D out.\n\nWhat about ""PROSO""? Not a word.\n\nI think PROWL is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\n""PROLL"" is not a word.\n\n""PROEM"" has E and M, eliminated.\n\n""PROUD"" is out.\n\n""PRONK"" has N, eliminated.\n\n""PROSS"" has S, eliminated.\n\nSo, among the valid options, PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\nNow, PROOF has the advantage that if the word has a double O, we\'ll know, but if not, we get information on F.\n\nSimilarly, PROWL tests W and L.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, and we want to cover more ground, perhaps PROWL is better because it uses two distinct new letters.\n\nAlso, L is a common letter.\n\nPROXY uses X and Y, which are less common, so if we guess PROXY and it\'s wrong, we might not learn as much.\n\nTherefore, I think PROWL is a good choice.\n\nBut we must output the guess.\n\nSo, next guess: PROWL.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: the word is ""P R O _ _"", and we are guessing ""P R O W L"".\n\nIf correct, great. If not, we get feedback on W and L.\n\nAlso, note that in ""proud"", we had U and D absent, so if the word had W or L, they would have been flagged if present? No, because in ""proud"", we didn\'t have W or L, so we don\'t know.\n\nSo, I think it\'s fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in position 1, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, R, and O are correct and in positions 1, 2, and 3. U and D are absent.\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `P R O _ _` (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed as P, R, O).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D (not in the word at all).\n- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (O is already placed but may repeat; other letters are untested for positions 4 and 5).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- The word starts with ""PRO"", so we need to guess the last two letters (positions 4 and 5).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., L, T, F, W).\n- Possible valid words include ""PROWL"" (tests W and L), ""PROOF"" (tests double O and F), or ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y). ""PROWL"" is chosen because:\n  - It uses two distinct, common letters (W and L) that haven\'t been tested yet.\n  - It avoids less common letters (like X and Y in ""PROXY"") and potential inefficiency of double letters (like in ""PROOF"").\n- If ""PROWL"" is incorrect, feedback on W and L will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., if W or L is present/absent).\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent\n- R: correct and in position (second letter)\n- A: absent\n- N: absent\n- E: absent\n\nGuess 2: ""prism""\n- P: correct and in position (first letter)\n- R: correct and in position (second letter)\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- M: absent\n\nGuess 3: ""proud""\n- P: correct (first letter)\n- R: correct (second letter)\n- O: correct and in position (third letter)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n\nSo after three guesses, we know:\n- The secret word is ""P R O _ _""\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D\n\nGuess 4: ""prowl""\n- P: correct (first letter)\n- R: correct (second letter)\n- O: correct (third letter)\n- W: absent\n- L: absent\n\nNew information: W and L are absent.\n\nNow, eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L\n\nSecret word pattern: ""P R O _ _""\n\nWe need to fill the last two positions with letters not in the eliminated set and form a valid English word.\n\nEliminated letters: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note that O, P, R are already in the word at specific positions.

If O is at position 4, it might be marked correct? Or if the word has only one O, but O is at 3, then the O at 4 might be absent? But since O was correct at 3, if the word has only one O, the second O would be absent.\n\nSimilarly, F at position 5, if present, etc.\n\nBut it will give information.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that introduces completely new letters to test, but since positions 4 and 5 are unknown, and we have to stick to the prefix PRO.\n\nSo I think PROOF is a good guess.\n\nThen, if not, we can try PROXY.\n\nBut let\'s make the guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PROOF"".After reviewing the feedback from all previous guesses, here\'s the step-by-step thought process for the next guess:\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n1. **Analyze Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is correct and in the second position. C, A, N, E are absent.\n   - **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is correct and in the first position, R is confirmed correct. I, S, M are absent.\n   - **Guess 3 (""proud"")**: P, O are correct and in positions 1 and 3 (R was already confirmed). U, D are absent.\n   - **Guess 4 (""prowl"")**: P, R, O are confirmed correct in positions 1–3. W, L are absent.\n   - **Current Known Pattern**: The secret word is **P R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as P, R, O).\n   - **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L (not in the word at all).\n\n2. **Deduce Constraints**:\n   - Positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters from the available pool: B, F, G, H, K, O, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.\n   - The word must start with ""PRO"" and be a valid English word.\n   - Since repeated letters are possible (as no feedback indicates duplicates), O or other letters could appear again.\n\n3. **Generate Valid Words**:\n   - Common words matching ""PRO"" pattern:\n     - ""PROOF"" (tests O at position 4 and F at position 5; both letters not yet tested).\n     - ""PROXY"" (tests X and Y; less common letters).\n     - ""PROTO"" (tests T and O; ""PROTO"" is niche/technical but might be valid).\n     - ""PROUD"" and ""PROWL"" have been guessed and eliminated.\n     - Other combinations (e.g., ""PROSE"", ""PRONE"") contain eliminated letters and are invalid.\n\n4. **Select Optimal Guess**:\n   - Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., F, T) to maximize information.\n   - ""PROOF"" is chosen because:\n       - It tests two new letters (O and F), which are common and impactful.\n       - If incorrect, feedback on O (position 4) and F (position 5) will quickly narrow options (e.g., reveal duplicates, positions, or eliminate F).\n       - ""PROXY"" (X, Y) and ""PROTO"" (T, O) are backups if needed.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - With 2 guesses remaining (after this), feedback from ""PROOF"" will likely solve the word quickly or reveal all letters.\n\n<guess>proof</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: proud -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x)\nGuess 5: proof -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) O(-) F(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> R is correct at position 2; C, A, N, E absent.
Guess 2: ""prism"" -> P is correct at position 1; R correct at 2; I, S, M absent.
Guess 3: ""proud"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; U, D absent.
Guess 4: ""prowl"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; W, L absent.
Guess 5: ""proof"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; second O (at position 4) is present but in the wrong position (-); F absent.

So new information from guess 5 (""proof""):
- Positions 1,2,3: P, R, O are correct (already known).
- Position 4: O is present in the word but not in this position. Since O is already at position 3 and is correct, this means the secret word contains at least two O's. One at position 3 and one elsewhere (not position 4).
- Position 5: F is absent.

Also, we know from previous guesses that the word has at least two O's.

Now, pattern: positions 1,2,3 are fixed: P R O.

Position 4 cannot be O (because feedback says O is present but wrong position for position 4), so the O must be at position 5 or? But the feedback says O is in the word but not in position 4, so since we have only position 5 left? The word must have O in position 5? Or could there be more than two O's?

Pattern: P R O _ _

We know:
- The word has at least one more O besides the one at position 3.
- Position 4 is not O (because it's marked wrong position, meaning the letter at position 4 is not O but the word has another O somewhere).
- Since position 4 cannot be O, and we have position 5, the other O must be at position 5? Or there could be another position? But we only have positions 4 and 5. So the word must be P R O ? O, i.e., with O at position 5.

But let me confirm: the feedback for guess 5: for the second O (at position 4) it is marked as ""-"", meaning present but in the wrong position. Specifically, it says O is not in position 4 but is elsewhere. Since positions 1,2,3 are already correct (and we have an O at position 3), the only other position is 5. So the secret word must have O at position 5.

Therefore, the word is P R O ? O.

So pattern: positions 1,2,3: P,R,O; position 5: O. Only position 4 is unknown.

So secret word: P R O _ O

Now, we need to find a letter for position 4 that is not in the eliminated set.

Eliminated letters: From all guesses:
- Guess 1: C, A, N, E
- Guess 2: I, S, M
- Guess 3: U, D
- Guess 4: W, L
- Guess 5: F (absent)
Also, the letters absent.

So eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L, F

Available letters: B, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

But note: O is used twice? We have O at position 3 and 5. Position 4 must be another letter.

Position 4 cannot be O because the feedback from ""proof"" says that if we put O at position 4, it is wrong position, but since we already have one O at position 3, and we are placing another O at position 4, which is incorrect because the actual other O is at position 5. So position 4 must not be O.

Therefore, position 4 is one of the available letters.

Now, words of form P R O _ O

Common word: PRO_O

What could it be?

Possible letters: allowed letters not eliminated and not used? But we can reuse, but we need a valid letter.

For example:
- PROMO: M is eliminated? Guess 2 says M absent? PROMO has M. M is eliminated.
- PROTO: T not eliminated? PROTO: P-R-O-T-O. Position 4 is T.
- PROBO? Not a word.
- PROVO: V not eliminated? PROVO: P-R-O-V-O. But this has V? And O at end.
- Also, PROSO? Not.

Is PROTO a common word? It might be accepted.

PROVO: as in protest, etc.

But let's list:

Possible words:
- PROTO: meaning prototype or first in form. Valid.
- PROVO: a city or a type of protest, could be proper noun? Might be accepted as a word.
- Also, PROBO? Not.
- PROXO? No.
- PROGO? No.

Other possibilities? GROTTO? But starts with G.

PRO has to be start.

PROVO and PROTO are the main ones.

Is there PROYO? No.

PROKO? Not.

So likely PROTO or PROVO.

But we have eliminated letters: Let's check.

For PROTO: uses T? T is not eliminated. We haven't used T yet? We haven't guessed T, so it might be present.

Similarly, PROVO: uses V? V is not eliminated.

Both T and V are in available list.

We need to guess which one.

But we have only one guess? No, this is guess 6? But we have tries left? We started at guess 1, then 2,3,4,5, now guess 6.

We have one more guess.

But we can guess either, or we can find out.

Since position 4 is the only unknown, and we need a letter, we can try a word that tests possible letters.

But we don't have to, since we are at guess 6, we can make the guess.

Possible words: PROTO and PROVO.

Is there PROBO? No.

Or PRODO? Not.

Therefore, we should guess one.

But which one is more common? PROTO might be more commonly used as a prefix or in technical terms.

PROVO might be less common.

In Wordle, PROVO was in word list? I don't know, but let's think.

Another word: ""PROMO"" is a common abbreviation, but M eliminated? Yes, M absent.

""PRONO"" not a word.

So between PROTO and PROVO.

Perhaps PROTO is better.

To confirm, we haven't tested T or V.

But we have no way to tell which one.

But we must guess.

Perhaps we missed a word.

What about ""PRO BONO""? Too long.

No, 5 letters.

Another word: ""GROOVE"" doesn't start with PR.

So I think only PROTO and PROVO.

But ""PROXY"" is not PRO_ O.

PROXY is P-R-O-X-Y, so not ending with O.

Therefore, we don't have an O at the end.

For this pattern, PRO_TO? Pattern is P R O _ O, so fourth letter and fifth is O.

PROTO: fourth is T, fifth is O.

PROVO: fourth is V, fifth is O.

We need to choose.

We can guess PROTO first? But we have only one guess now? This is the sixth guess.

We used guess 1 to 5, now guess 6.

We must get it right.

Perhaps we can think of feedback.

For example, in guess 5, with ""proof"", we had O at position 4 given '-', meaning present but wrong position. Since position 5 was F, which was absent, and position 4 O was misplaced. Given the correct positions, the O must be at position 5.

Therefore, secret word ends with O.

Now, position 4 must be one letter.

Is there another word? BROOD? But starts with B.

Not.

CROON? Starts with C, eliminated.

So only PROTO and PROVO, and perhaps others?

PROGO? Not.

PROSS? S eliminated.

PRODD? D eliminated.

So yes.

Perhaps ""TROPO""? Not starting with P.

I think we have to choose.

Let's check letter frequencies. T is more common than V, so PROTO is more likely.

In common word lists, PROTO might be accepted as a root word.

PROVO is a proper noun sometimes, but might not be in dictionary.

Therefore, I will guess PROTO.

So last guess: PROTO

But let's output.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process  
- **Pattern Confirmed**: Feedback from ""proof"" shows that P, R, O are correct in positions 1, 2, and 3 (as consistent with prior guesses). The second O (position 4) is marked as present but in the wrong position (""-""), while F (position 5) is absent. This implies:  
  - The secret word has **at least two O's** (one confirmed at position 3).  
  - Since position 4 cannot be O (feedback shows wrong position), the only remaining position for the second O is **position 5**. Thus, the secret word must follow the pattern: **P R O _ O**.  
- **Eliminated Letters**: Consolidated from all feedback:  
  - Absent letters: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), I, S, M (from ""prism""), U, D (from ""proud""), W, L (from ""prowl""), F (from ""proof"").  
  - Eliminated list: **C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L, F**.  
- **Available Letters for Position 4**: Position 4 must be filled with a letter not eliminated and unused in known positions. Possible letters: B, G, H, K, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z.  
- **Valid Word Options**:  
  - Words matching ""P R O _ O"" require a valid English word.  
  - Possible candidates: ""PROTO"" (with ""T"" in position 4), ""PROVO"" (with ""V"" in position 4). Other combinations are invalid (e.g., ""PROBO"" isn't a word; ""PROMO"" uses M, eliminated).  
  - ""PROTO"" is more common (as a prefix/root word) vs. ""PROVO"" (less common/proper noun).  
- **Decision**: With one guess remaining (guess 6), ""PROTO"" is selected as the most probable word based on letter frequency (T is common) and validity.  

<guess>proto</guess>",proto,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> R is correct at position 2; C, A, N, E absent.
Guess 2: ""prism"" -> P is correct at position 1; R correct at 2; I, S, M absent.
Guess 3: ""proud"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; U, D absent.
Guess 4: ""prowl"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; W, L absent.
Guess 5: ""proof"" -> P, R, O correct at positions 1,2,3; second O (at position 4) is present but in the wrong position (-); F absent.

So new information from guess 5 (""proof""):
- Positions 1,2,3: P, R, O are correct (already known).
- Position 4: O is present in the word but not in this position. Since O is already at position 3 and is correct, this means the secret word contains at least two O's. One at position 3 and one elsewhere (not position 4).
- Position 5: F is absent.

Also, we know from previous guesses that the word has at least two O's.

Now, pattern: positions 1,2,3 are fixed: P R O.

Position 4 cannot be O (because feedback says O is present but wrong position for position 4), so the O must be at position 5 or? But the feedback says O is in the word but not in position 4, so since we have only position 5 left? The word must have O in position 5? Or could there be more than two O's?

Pattern: P R O _ _

We know:
- The word has at least one more O besides the one at position 3.
- Position 4 is not O (because it's marked wrong position, meaning the letter at position 4 is not O but the word has another O somewhere).
- Since position 4 cannot be O, and we have position 5, the other O must be at position 5? Or there could be another position? But we only have positions 4 and 5. So the word must be P R O ? O, i.e., with O at position 5.

But let me confirm: the feedback for guess 5: for the second O (at position 4) it is marked as ""-"", meaning present but in the wrong position. Specifically, it says O is not in position 4 but is elsewhere. Since positions 1,2,3 are already correct (and we have an O at position 3), the only other position is 5. So the secret word must have O at position 5.

Therefore, the word is P R O ? O.

So pattern: positions 1,2,3: P,R,O; position 5: O. Only position 4 is unknown.

So secret word: P R O _ O

Now, we need to find a letter for position 4 that is not in the eliminated set.

Eliminated letters: From all guesses:
- Guess 1: C, A, N, E
- Guess 2: I, S, M
- Guess 3: U, D
- Guess 4: W, L
- Guess 5: F (absent)
Also, the letters absent.

So eliminated: C, A, N, E, I, S, M, U, D, W, L, F

Available letters: B, G, H, K, O, P, Q, R, T, V, X, Y, Z

But note: O is used twice? We have O at position 3 and 5. Position 4 must be another letter.

Position 4 cannot be O because the feedback from ""proof"" says that if we put O at position 4, it is wrong position, but since we already have one O at position 3, and we are placing another O at position 4, which is incorrect because the actual other O is at position 5. So position 4 must not be O.

Therefore, position 4 is one of the available letters.

Now, words of form P R O _ O

Common word: PRO_O

What could it be?

Possible letters: allowed letters not eliminated and not used? But we can reuse, but we need a valid letter.

For example:
- PROMO: M is eliminated? Guess 2 says M absent? PROMO has M. M is eliminated.
- PROTO: T not eliminated? PROTO: P-R-O-T-O. Position 4 is T.
- PROBO? Not a word.
- PROVO: V not eliminated? PROVO: P-R-O-V-O. But this has V? And O at end.
- Also, PROSO? Not.

Is PROTO a common word? It might be accepted.

PROVO: as in protest, etc.

But let's list:

Possible words:
- PROTO: meaning prototype or first in form. Valid.
