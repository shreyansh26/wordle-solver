We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - and we guessed it in position 1).
   - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - A is not in the word.
   - N is not in the word.
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

 So, we know:
   - The second letter is R and the fifth letter is E.
   - The word has the letters C and E (but E is already placed at the end) and also C is present but not at the start.
   - A and N are absent.

 The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

 We also know that the word contains C (but not in the first position) and does not contain A or N.

 Since the first letter is not C (because C is present but in the wrong position, and we put it first) and the second is R, the C must be in one of the positions 3, 4, or possibly 5? But position 5 is E, so C must be in position 3 or 4.

 However, note that the feedback for C is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. So C is in the word and must be in position 3 or 4.

 Also, we have two letters that are not in the word: A and N.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word that:
   - Has R in the second position and E in the fifth position (to keep the known correct ones).
   - Includes the letter C in either position 3 or 4 (to test for its correct position) and also other new letters to discover the remaining letters.
   - Avoids the letters A and N.

 We can try to put C in position 3 and then use new letters for the first and fourth positions.

 Let's think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E

 We know the first letter cannot be C (because we already tried C in first and it was wrong) and also cannot be A or N (since they are absent). Also, the fourth letter is unknown.

 We can try a word like ""PRICE"":
   - P in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (correct), I in position 3 (new), C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4), E in position 5 (correct).

 But note: we have to consider that C might be in position 3. So if we put C in position 4, we might get feedback that helps.

 Alternatively, we could try to put C in position 3 and use a new letter in position 4.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters. Let's think of common letters that are not A, N, and not already used (we have used C, R, E). We have used C, R, E, and we know A and N are out.

 We can try to use other vowels? We know the word has at least R and E, and C. The vowels we haven't tried are I, O, U. We also have consonants.

 Another idea: we can try ""CRUDE"", but note that we already know C is not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in the first position again because we know it's not there. So ""CRUDE"" would have C in first which we know is wrong. So that's not efficient.

 Let me try to think of words that have the form: [not C, not A, not N] R [letter] [letter] E, and one of the letters in the middle must be C? Actually, we don't know if the middle letters are C or not, but we know C is somewhere.

 But note: we must include C in the guess because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include C, we won't get information about its position. However, we are allowed to guess without C? But that might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in position 3 or 4 and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid A and N:

 Option 1: Put C in position 3: 
   - The word would be: [letter1] R C [letter4] E
   - What are some words? 
        BRICE? (but B is a new letter, and I is a vowel) -> but is BRICE a word? It's not common. 
        PRICE? (P R I C E) -> but note, we are putting C in position 4? Actually, in PRICE, C is in position 4? 
        Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so that's the same as above.

 Actually, if we put C in position 4, then we are testing if C is at position 4. But we also have the possibility that C is at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3: 
   - Example: ""TRACE"" -> but we know A is absent, so TRACE has A and we know A is not in the word. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A and without N.

 Let me try to find words with the pattern: [letter] R [C?] [letter] E, and without A and N.

 Possibilities:
   - If we put C in position 3: 
        ? R C ? E
        Words: force (F, O, R, C, E) -> F in position1, O in position4? Actually: F(1), R(2), C(3), E(5) -> but then position4 is missing? 
        Actually, ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that's 5 letters: F(1), O(2)? No, that doesn't fit because we need R in position2.

 We need the pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 So for ""force"": 
   F is position1, O is position2? -> but we need R in position2. So that doesn't work.

 How about ""crick""? But that has two C's and we don't know if the word has two C's? Also, it ends with K, not E.

 We need the fifth letter to be E.

 How about ""price"": 
   P R I C E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> this fits.

 But note: we are testing if C is in position4. If the secret word has C in position3, then in ""price"", the C in position4 would be a wrong position (if the word doesn't have two C's) or if it has two C's then it might be marked as present but wrong position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position3: 
   Example: ""recce""? Not a common word and it has two E's and two C's, and we don't know if the word has duplicates.

 Another: ""grace"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.

 How about ""brute""? But that doesn't have C. We know C is in the word, so we should include it to get more information.

 We must include C because we know it's in the word and we haven't located it yet.

 So, let's go with ""PRICE"". 

 Why ""PRICE""?
   - It has R in position2 and E in position5 (so we keep the known correct ones).
   - It tests C in position4 (if the feedback shows that C is in the correct position, then we know it's at 4; if it shows as present but wrong position, then it must be in position3 because we know it's not in position1 and position2 is R and position5 is E and we are putting C in position4).
   - It introduces two new letters: P and I.

 Also, we avoid A and N.

 So, let's guess ""PRICE"".

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly. However, in the first guess, we had only one C and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the word has two C's, we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know.

 However, we are going with ""PRICE"".

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has C in position3, but I'm having trouble finding a common word without A and N that fits the pattern and has C in position3. 

 Another candidate: ""force"" doesn't fit because the second letter is O, not R.

 How about ""trace"" -> but we know A is absent, so we can't use that.

 Another: ""brick"" -> but it ends with K, not E.

 So, ""PRICE"" seems a reasonable guess.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""PRICE"".

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (marked `✓`).
- **A** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **N** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (marked `✓`).

The secret word has the form: `_ R _ _ E`, and it **contains C** (somewhere in positions 3 or 4, since positions 1, 2, and 5 are occupied or incorrect for C). It **excludes A and N**.

For the second guess:
- Retain `R` in position 2 and `E` in position 5.
- Test `C` in position 4 (to check if it belongs there).
- Introduce new common letters (`P` and `I`) in positions 1 and 3 to gather more information.
- Avoid `A` and `N`.

**Selected guess: ""PRICE""**  
- Structure: `P` (new) | `R` (fixed) | `I` (new) | `C` (testing position 4) | `E` (fixed).

   - Has R in the second position and E in the fifth position (to keep the known correct ones).
   - Includes the letter C in either position 3 or 4 (to test for its correct position) and also other new letters to discover the remaining letters.
   - Avoids the letters A and N.

 We can try to put C in position 3 and then use new letters for the first and fourth positions.

 Let's think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E

 We know the first letter cannot be C (because we already tried C in first and it was wrong) and also cannot be A or N (since they are absent). Also, the fourth letter is unknown.

 We can try a word like ""PRICE"":
   - P in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (correct), I in position 3 (new), C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4), E in position 5 (correct).

 But note: we have to consider that C might be in position 3. So if we put C in position 4, we might get feedback that helps.

 Alternatively, we could try to put C in position 3 and use a new letter in position 4.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters. Let's think of common letters that are not A, N, and not already used (we have used C, R, E). We have used C, R, E, and we know A and N are out.

 We can try to use other vowels? We know the word has at least R and E, and C. The vowels we haven't tried are I, O, U. We also have consonants.

 Another idea: we can try ""CRUDE"", but note that we already know C is not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in the first position again because we know it's not there. So ""CRUDE"" would have C in first which we know is wrong. So that's not efficient.

 Let me try to think of words that have the form: [not C, not A, not N] R [letter] [letter] E, and one of the letters in the middle must be C? Actually, we don't know if the middle letters are C or not, but we know C is somewhere.

 But note: we must include C in the guess because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include C, we won't get information about its position. However, we are allowed to guess without C? But that might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has C in position 3 or 4 and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid A and N:

 Option 1: Put C in position 3: 
   - The word would be: [letter1] R C [letter4] E
   - What are some words? 
        BRICE? (but B is a new letter, and I is a vowel) -> but is BRICE a word? It's not common. 
        PRICE? (P R I C E) -> but note, we are putting C in position 4? Actually, in PRICE, C is in position 4? 
        Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so that's the same as above.

 Actually, if we put C in position 4, then we are testing if C is at position 4. But we also have the possibility that C is at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position 3: 
   - Example: ""TRACE"" -> but we know A is absent, so TRACE has A and we know A is not in the word. So we cannot use A.

 We need a word without A and without N.

 Let me try to find words with the pattern: [letter] R [C?] [letter] E, and without A and N.

 Possibilities:
   - If we put C in position 3: 
        ? R C ? E
        Words: force (F, O, R, C, E) -> F in position1, O in position4? Actually: F(1), R(2), C(3), E(5) -> but then position4 is missing? 
        Actually, ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that's 5 letters: F(1), O(2)? No, that doesn't fit because we need R in position2.

 We need the pattern: [1] R [3] [4] E

 So for ""force"": 
   F is position1, O is position2? -> but we need R in position2. So that doesn't work.

 How about ""crick""? But that has two C's and we don't know if the word has two C's? Also, it ends with K, not E.

 We need the fifth letter to be E.

 How about ""price"": 
   P R I C E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> this fits.

 But note: we are testing if C is in position4. If the secret word has C in position3, then in ""price"", the C in position4 would be a wrong position (if the word doesn't have two C's) or if it has two C's then it might be marked as present but wrong position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in position3: 
   Example: ""recce""? Not a common word and it has two E's and two C's, and we don't know if the word has duplicates.

 Another: ""grace"" -> but has A (which is absent) -> invalid.

 How about ""brute""? But that doesn't have C. We know C is in the word, so we should include it to get more information.

 We must include C because we know it's in the word and we haven't located it yet.

 So, let's go with ""PRICE"". 

 Why ""PRICE""?
   - It has R in position2 and E in position5 (so we keep the known correct ones).
   - It tests C in position4 (if the feedback shows that C is in the correct position, then we know it's at 4; if it shows as present but wrong position, then it must be in position3 because we know it's not in position1 and position2 is R and position5 is E and we are putting C in position4).
   - It introduces two new letters: P and I.

 Also, we avoid A and N.

 So, let's guess ""PRICE"".

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly. However, in the first guess, we had only one C and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if the word has two C's, we might get two minuses or one check and one minus? But we don't know.

 However, we are going with ""PRICE"".

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has C in position3, but I'm having trouble finding a common word without A and N that fits the pattern and has C in position3. 

 Another candidate: ""force"" doesn't fit because the second letter is O, not R.

 How about ""trace"" -> but we know A is absent, so we can't use that.

 Another: ""brick"" -> but it ends with K, not E.

 So, ""PRICE"" seems a reasonable guess.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""PRICE"".

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is in the word but not in position 1 (marked `-`).
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (marked `✓`).
- **A** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **N** is not in the word (marked `x`).
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (marked `✓`).

The secret word has the form: `_ R _ _ E`, and it **contains C** (somewhere in positions 3 or 4, since positions 1, 2, and 5 are occupied or incorrect for C). It **excludes A and N**.

For the second guess:
- Retain `R` in position 2 and `E` in position 5.
- Test `C` in position 4 (to check if it belongs there).
- Introduce new common letters (`P` and `I`) in positions 1 and 3 to gather more information.
- Avoid `A` and `N`.

**Selected guess: ""PRICE""**  
- Structure: `P` (new) | `R` (fixed) | `I` (new) | `C` (testing position 4) | `E` (fixed).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (marked as -)
- R: correct position (✓)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

Guess 2: ""price""
- P: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓)
- I: absent (x)
- C: correct position (✓)
- E: correct position (✓)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E (since R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5, and from guess 1 we know the first letter is not C, but now we have more information).

2. From guess 2, we see that C is now in the correct position (position 4). So the secret word has C in the 4th position. Therefore, the word is: _ R _ C E

3. Also from guess 2, P and I are absent. So we know that P and I are not in the word.

4. From guess 1, we know that A and N are absent.

5. Additionally, we know that C is in the word and now we know it's in position 4.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: A, N, P, I.

We also have the known present letters: R, C, E (with R in position 2, C in position 4, E in position 5).

The word structure: [1] R [3] C E

We need to find the first and third letters.

We know the first letter cannot be: C (from first guess, it was in position 1 and was wrong), and also cannot be A, N, P, I.

Similarly, the third letter cannot be A, N, P, I, and also cannot be R or C or E? Actually, it can be any letter except the absent ones, but we don't know about duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tried yet. The remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that fits _ R _ C E.

We can try to think of words that match this pattern and use letters that are common and not excluded.

Some possibilities:

- TRACE: but A is absent, so no.
- BRACE: A absent, no.
- GRACE: A absent, no.
- WRECK: that's W R E C K -> but we need the fifth letter to be E, and here it's K? Also, the pattern is _ R _ C E, so the last letter is E, so WRECK doesn't fit because it ends with K.

Let me list words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position.

Common words: 
- FORCE: F O R C E -> positions: 1:F, 2:O? No, we need second letter to be R. So FORCE has O in position 2, not R.

We need the second letter to be R, so the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] C E

Examples:
- TRACE: T R A C E -> but A is absent.
- BRICK: B R I C K -> but I is absent and it ends with K, not E.
- BRUTE: B R U T E -> but this has T and U, and no C? We need C in position 4? BRUTE is B R U T E, so position 4 is T, not C. We need position 4 to be C.

So we need the fourth letter to be C. So the word must be [letter] R [letter] C E.

Let me think of words: 
- FRANCE: too long, 6 letters? No, 5 letters: F R A N C E -> but that's 6? F-R-A-N-C-E? Actually, ""france"" is 6? No, F-R-A-N-C-E is 6 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words: 
- WRECK: W R E C K -> but position 3 is E, and position 5 is K, not E. And we need position 5 to be E.
- BRACE: B R A C E -> but A is absent.
- GRACE: G R A C E -> A absent.
- TRICE: T R I C E -> but I is absent (from guess 2, I is absent).

TRICE: T R I C E -> I is absent, so not allowed.

Another: FORCE: F O R C E -> but position 2 is O, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

We need the second letter to be R, so the word must start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then a letter, then C, then E.

Let me try to search for words: 
- BRUTE: doesn't have C.
- CRUDE: C is in position 1, but we know position 1 is not C (from first guess). Also, we have C in position 4 now, so if we put C in position 1, it would be wrong, but we are not going to do that.

We need a word that has the third letter as a new letter and the first letter as a new letter, and both not in the absent list.

Possible words: 
- ""URBAN"" - but doesn't fit the pattern and has A and N which are absent.
- How about ""MERGE""? M E R G E -> position 2 is E, not R.

I need to think of words that start with a letter, then R, then a vowel or consonant, then C, then E.

Let me list: 
- TRACE (invalid due to A)
- BRICE? B R I C E -> but I is absent.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> no C, and position 4 is V, not C.

Another: ""FORCE"" doesn't have R in position 2.

Perhaps ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't end with E.

I recall that ""URCE"" is not a common ending. 

Wait, what about ""PIECE""? P I E C E -> but P and I are absent, and position 2 is I, not R.

We need position 2 to be R.

Another idea: ""TRUCE"" -> T R U C E. This fits the pattern: T in position 1, R in 2, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5.

Now, check the absent letters: A, N, P, I. U is not in the absent list, and T is not in the absent list.

So ""TRUCE"" is a valid word and uses T and U, which are new.

But we have to make sure that T and U are not absent. Since we haven't guessed them, they are possibilities.

So let's consider ""TRUCE"" as a candidate.

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution. We can use this as a guess to test.

However, we might be able to solve it if we are lucky.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""BRUTE"" -> B R U T E -> but position 4 is T, not C. We need C in position 4.

""BRACE"" has A.

""GRACE"" has A.

""WRECK"" doesn't end with E in the sense that position 5 is K, but we need E.

""FRECK"" is not a word.

""CRISP"" -> C R I S P -> but I and P are absent, and it doesn't end with E.

So ""TRUCE"" seems a good candidate.

But note: in ""TRUCE"", we have T in position 1 and U in position 3.

We don't know if T and U are in the word, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common unused letters.

But ""TRUCE"" is a valid English word meaning a temporary peace.

Another word: ""FORCE"" doesn't fit.

""SOURCE"" -> S O U R C E -> but position 2 is O, not R.

""SCARE"" -> S C A R E -> but A is absent and pattern doesn't match.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""TRUCE"":

If the secret word is ""TRUCE"", then:
- T: in position 1? We don't know yet.
- R: correct.
- U: in position 3? We don't know.
- C: correct.
- E: correct.

But we are not assuming the word is ""TRUCE"", we are using it as a guess to get information.

We could also consider ""DANCE"", but A and N are absent.

Another possibility: ""GROCE"" is not a word.

""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> no C.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might be able to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have the C in position 4 fixed, but we know C is in position 4 from the second guess. So we don't need to test that again.

In the second guess, we got C in position 4 as correct, so it's fixed.

So we must have the pattern: _ R _ C E

And we need to find the first and third letters.

We can try a word that has the first and third positions filled with new letters, and we avoid absent letters.

So ""TRUCE"" uses T and U, which are new.

We could also try ""BRUTE"", but that doesn't have C, so it wouldn't be valid because we know C is in the word? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and ""BRUTE"" is valid, but it doesn't have C. However, we know the secret word has C, so if we guess ""BRUTE"", we would get feedback that C is missing? But we already know C is in the word, so it's better to include known letters to confirm.

But in this case, we know C is in position 4, so we should keep it to reduce possibilities.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRUCE"".

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had C marked as present but not in position 1, and now in the second guess, when we put C in position 4, it was correct. So C is fixed at position 4.

Similarly, R and E are fixed.

So the only unknowns are position 1 and 3.

We have two positions to guess, and we have two new letters in ""TRUCE"": T and U.

If we get feedback that T is correct and U is correct, then we have the word.

If T is absent, then we know position 1 is not T, and U might be correct or not.

But we can use that information.

So let's go with ""TRUCE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C is present but not in position 1, R is correct (position 2), A is absent, N is absent, E is correct (position 5).
- **Guess 2 (""price""):** P is absent, R is correct (position 2), I is absent, C is correct (position 4), E is correct (position 5).

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R _ C E` (R in position 2, C in position 4, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: A, N, P, I (cannot appear in the word).
- Present letters: C, R, E (with C and R confirmed in positions 4 and 2, respectively).
- Unknowns: Position 1 and position 3 need to be solved. These must be letters not in the absent list (e.g., common options like T, U, O, S, L, D, etc.).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test new, common letters in positions 1 and 3 to gather information while respecting the fixed pattern (`_ R _ C E`).
- Avoid absent letters (A, N, P, I).
- ""TRUCE"" is a strong candidate:
  - Fits the pattern: T (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), U (position 3), C (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
  - Tests T and U (common letters not yet tried).
  - If T or U are absent, it narrows possibilities for positions 1 and 3. If both are correct, it solves the word.

<guess>truce</guess>",truce,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (marked as -)
- R: correct position (✓)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

Guess 2: ""price""
- P: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓)
- I: absent (x)
- C: correct position (✓)
- E: correct position (✓)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E (since R and E are fixed in positions 2 and 5, and from guess 1 we know the first letter is not C, but now we have more information).

2. From guess 2, we see that C is now in the correct position (position 4). So the secret word has C in the 4th position. Therefore, the word is: _ R _ C E

3. Also from guess 2, P and I are absent. So we know that P and I are not in the word.

4. From guess 1, we know that A and N are absent.

5. Additionally, we know that C is in the word and now we know it's in position 4.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: A, N, P, I.

We also have the known present letters: R, C, E (with R in position 2, C in position 4, E in position 5).

The word structure: [1] R [3] C E

We need to find the first and third letters.

We know the first letter cannot be: C (from first guess, it was in position 1 and was wrong), and also cannot be A, N, P, I.

Similarly, the third letter cannot be A, N, P, I, and also cannot be R or C or E? Actually, it can be any letter except the absent ones, but we don't know about duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tried yet. The remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y. Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that fits _ R _ C E.

We can try to think of words that match this pattern and use letters that are common and not excluded.

Some possibilities:

- TRACE: but A is absent, so no.
- BRACE: A absent, no.
- GRACE: A absent, no.
- WRECK: that's W R E C K -> but we need the fifth letter to be E, and here it's K? Also, the pattern is _ R _ C E, so the last letter is E, so WRECK doesn't fit because it ends with K.

Let me list words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position.

Common words: 
- FORCE: F O R C E -> positions: 1:F, 2:O? No, we need second letter to be R. So FORCE has O in position 2, not R.

We need the second letter to be R, so the pattern is: [letter] R [letter] C E

Examples:
- TRACE: T R A C E -> but A is absent.
- BRICK: B R I C K -> but I is absent and it ends with K, not E.
- BRUTE: B R U T E -> but this has T and U, and no C? We need C in position 4? BRUTE is B R U T E, so position 4 is T, not C. We need position 4 to be C.

So we need the fourth letter to be C. So the word must be [letter] R [letter] C E.

Let me think of words: 
- FRANCE: too long, 6 letters? No, 5 letters: F R A N C E -> but that's 6? F-R-A-N-C-E? Actually, ""france"" is 6? No, F-R-A-N-C-E is 6 letters. We need 5.

5-letter words: 
- WRECK: W R E C K -> but position 3 is E, and position 5 is K, not E. And we need position 5 to be E.
- BRACE: B R A C E -> but A is absent.
- GRACE: G R A C E -> A absent.
- TRICE: T R I C E -> but I is absent (from guess 2, I is absent).

TRICE: T R I C E -> I is absent, so not allowed.

Another: FORCE: F O R C E -> but position 2 is O, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

We need the second letter to be R, so the word must start with a consonant (or vowel) and then R, then a letter, then C, then E.

Let me try to search for words: 
- BRUTE: doesn't have C.
- CRUDE: C is in position 1, but we know position 1 is not C (from first guess). Also, we have C in position 4 now, so if we put C in position 1, it would be wrong, but we are not going to do that.

We need a word that has the third letter as a new letter and the first letter as a new letter, and both not in the absent list.

Possible words: 
- ""URBAN"" - but doesn't fit the pattern and has A and N which are absent.
- How about ""MERGE""? M E R G E -> position 2 is E, not R.

I need to think of words that start with a letter, then R, then a vowel or consonant, then C, then E.

Let me list: 
- TRACE (invalid due to A)
- BRICE? B R I C E -> but I is absent.
- DROVE: D R O V E -> no C, and position 4 is V, not C.

Another: ""FORCE"" doesn't have R in position 2.

Perhaps ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't end with E.

I recall that ""URCE"" is not a common ending. 

Wait, what about ""PIECE""? P I E C E -> but P and I are absent, and position 2 is I, not R.

We need position 2 to be R.

Another idea: ""TRUCE"" -> T R U C E. This fits the pattern: T in position 1, R in 2, U in 3, C in 4, E in 5.

Now, check the absent letters: A, N, P, I. U is not in the absent list, and T is not in the absent list.

So ""TRUCE"" is a valid word and uses T and U, which are new.

But we have to make sure that T and U are not absent. Since we haven't guessed them, they are possibilities.

So let's consider ""TRUCE"" as a candidate.

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the solution. We can use this as a guess to test.

However, we might be able to solve it if we are lucky.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""BRUTE"" -> B R U T E -> but position 4 is T, not C. We need C in position 4.

""BRACE"" has A.

""GRACE"" has A.

""WRECK"" doesn't end with E in the sense that position 5 is K, but we need E.

""FRECK"" is not a word.

""CRISP"" -> C R I S P -> but I and P are absent, and it doesn't end with E.

So ""TRUCE"" seems a good candidate.

But note: in ""TRUCE"", we have T in position 1 and U in position 3.

We don't know if T and U are in the word, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common unused letters.

But ""TRUCE"" is a valid English word meaning a temporary peace.

Another word: ""FORCE"" doesn't fit.

""SOURCE"" -> S O U R C E -> but position 2 is O, not R.

""SCARE"" -> S C A R E -> but A is absent and pattern doesn't match.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""TRUCE"":

If the secret word is ""TRUCE"", then:
- T: in position 1? We don't know yet.
- R: correct.
- U: in position 3? We don't know.
- C: correct.
- E: correct.

But we are not assuming the word is ""TRUCE"", we are using it as a guess to get information.

We could also consider ""DANCE"", but A and N are absent.

Another possibility: ""GROCE"" is not a word.

""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> no C.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a reasonable guess.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We might be able to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have the C in position 4 fixed, but we know C is in position 4 from the second guess. So we don't need to test that again.

In the second guess, we got C in position 4 as correct, so it's fixed.

So we must have the pattern: _ R _ C E

And we need to find the first and third letters.

We can try a word that has the first and third positions filled with new letters, and we avoid absent letters.

So ""TRUCE"" uses T and U, which are new.

We could also try ""BRUTE"", but that doesn't have C, so it wouldn't be valid because we know C is in the word? Actually, we must guess a valid word, and ""BRUTE"" is valid, but it doesn't have C. However, we know the secret word has C, so if we guess ""BRUTE"", we would get feedback that C is missing? But we already know C is in the word, so it's better to include known letters to confirm.

But in this case, we know C is in position 4, so we should keep it to reduce possibilities.

So I think ""TRUCE"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRUCE"".

But let me double-check: in the first guess, we had C marked as present but not in position 1, and now in the second guess, when we put C in position 4, it was correct. So C is fixed at position 4.

Similarly, R and E are fixed.

So the only unknowns are position 1 and 3.

We have two positions to guess, and we have two new letters in ""TRUCE"": T and U.

If we get feedback that T is correct and U is correct, then we have the word.

If T is absent, then we know position 1 is not T, and U might be correct or not.

But we can use that information.

So let's go with ""TRUCE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C is present but not in position 1, R is correct (position 2), A is absent, N is absent, E is correct (position 5).
- **Guess 2 (""price""):** P is absent, R is correct (position 2), I is absent, C is correct (position 4), E is correct (position 5).

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R _ C E` (R in position 2, C in position 4, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: A, N, P, I (cannot appear in the word).
- Present letters: C, R, E (with C and R confirmed in positions 4 and 2, respectively).
- Unknowns: Position 1 and position 3 need to be solved. These must be letters not in the absent list (e.g., common options like T, U, O, S, L, D, etc.).

### Strategy for the next guess:

- Avoid absent letters (A, N, P, I).
- ""TRUCE"" is a strong candidate:
  - Fits the pattern: T (position 1), R (position 2, fixed), U (position 3), C (position 4, fixed), E (position 5, fixed).
  - Tests T and U (common letters not yet tried).
  - If T or U are absent, it narrows possibilities for positions 1 and 3. If both are correct, it solves the word.",Guess 3: truce -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) U(✓) C(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
