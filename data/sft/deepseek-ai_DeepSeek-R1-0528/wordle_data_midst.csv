We have feedback from Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. We should pick a word that uses other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters that are still available include: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

A good second guess should have letters that we haven't tested yet and that are likely to appear in 5-letter words.

Let's think of a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SLOTH"": Uses S, L, O, T, H
- ""PIOUS"": Uses P, I, O, U, S
- ""DUMPY"": Uses D, U, M, P, Y

But note: We want to maximize the coverage of new letters.

Another classic second guess after eliminating some vowels is to use other vowels and consonants.

Since A and E are eliminated (common vowels), we have other vowels: O, I, U, and sometimes Y.

But U and Y are less common. O and I are good choices.

Also, consonants like S, T, L are very common.

So, a word like ""TULIP"" might be good? But T in CRANE was not present? Wait, in our feedback R is x, but T wasn't tested. CRANE didn't have T, so T is still possible.

CRANE had C, R, A, N, E -> all x, so T, O, I, etc. are untouched.

Let's choose a word that includes O and I since we haven't tested those vowels.

Possible words: ""POIST"" but that's not a word. ""JOIST"" - J might not be common. ""MOIST"" is good.

MOIST: M, O, I, S, T

This would test M, O, I, S, T - all new letters.

Another option: ""GHOUL"" but G and H are less common and U is less common.

""LIGHT"" - L, I, G, H, T - G and H are less common.

""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S - U is a vowel but might be less frequent.

""MOIST"" seems solid because O and I are vowels and S, T are common consonants.

We also can consider ""SLIPT"" but not common. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - P and L are good.

But ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - that's five new letters.

Similarly, ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T.

Both are effective.

I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it avoids M which might be less common than P or L? But actually, S, P, L, I, T are all very common.

""SPLIT"" has two consonants that could be in many positions.

Alternatively, we can think about the word list.

Since we have eliminated five letters, including two vowels (A and E), we should use other vowels: O and I.

Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it has common letters and covers a good set.

But ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T. All new and common.

We could choose ""CHUMP"" but C is already eliminated, so no.

C is eliminated, so no C.

So, ""SPLIT"" is valid.

Another option: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. U and B might be less common.

I think ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"" are both fine.

I'll go with ""SPLIT"".

But wait, what about ""POINT""? P, O, I, N, T - but N was eliminated! In CRANE, N was x, so N is not in the word. We cannot use N.

Similarly, A, E, R, C are out.

So in ""POINT"", N is not allowed because feedback said N(x), meaning not in the word. Therefore, we cannot use letters that were x.

So, avoid C, R, A, N, E.

That rules out ""POINT"" because of N.

""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T - none of the eliminated letters.

""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - also acceptable.

Let's choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

So, guess: SPLIT

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters and focus on other common 5-letter English words using untested letters to maximize information gain. I'll select ""SPLIT"" because it:
- Uses new common letters: S, P, L, I, T (all not tested yet).
- Covers high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and the vowel I.
- Avoids eliminated letters, ensuring no wasted guess.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters and focus on other common 5-letter English words using untested letters to maximize information gain. I\'ll select ""SPLIT"" because it:\n- Uses new common letters: S, P, L, I, T (all not tested yet).\n- Covers high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and the vowel I.\n- Avoids eliminated letters, ensuring no wasted guess.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>SPLIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. SPLIT: 
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: absent (x)
   - I: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: correct position (✓) at the last position.

So, from SPLIT:
- T is in the word and is in the 5th position (correct).
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- I is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- P and L are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- It contains S and I, but S is not at position 1, and I is not at position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Ends with T (since position 5 is T).
- Includes S and I (which we know are present) but not in positions we know they are wrong (S not at 1, I not at 4).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Also, we have to consider the positions for S and I.

Since S is not at position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, I is not at position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ T.

We know S is in the word but not position 1, so S is in {2,3,4}.
I is in the word but not position 4, so I is in {1,2,3}.

Also, we need to include both S and I in the guess, and we can add other letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T which we know are in, but T is fixed at the end).

But we have to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly the letters we know: at least S, I, T, and two other letters from the available set.

Since we have two positions to fill (besides the known T at the end) and we know S and I must be placed, but we don't know their positions yet.

In the next guess, we should try to place S and I in positions that are possible and test new letters for the remaining positions.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback), and it could be I or a new letter.
- Position 4: cannot be I (from feedback), and it could be S or a new letter.

We have to guess a word that ends with T, and has S and I in it, with S not at 1 and I not at 4.

Also, we should avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's think of words ending with T that contain S and I.

For example:
- ""MOIST"" but M is available, but ""MOIST"" has O and I, but in ""MOIST"": positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in our feedback for SPLIT, S was marked as present but not position 1, which is consistent, but I was marked as present but not position 4. In ""MOIST"", I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine. However, we have feedback that P and L are absent, and ""MOIST"" doesn't have P or L, so it's okay. But we also have to check if it uses any eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,L are eliminated. ""MOIST"" has M,O,I,S,T - none of these are eliminated, so it's a candidate.

But in our previous guess SPLIT, we had S at position 1 (which was wrong position) and I at position 4 (which was wrong position). Now in ""MOIST"", S is at position 4 and I at position 3. Since I is at 3, which is not 4, that's fine. S is at 4, which is not 1, also fine.

But we need to see if this tests new letters. ""MOIST"" has M and O, which are new.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that places S and I in different positions to test other possibilities.

For instance, if we put I at position 1, which is allowed, and S at position 2 or 3.

But let's list possible words.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J, O, I, S, T. J is less common, but possible. Positions: J1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in this case, I is at 3 (not 4, ok), S at 4 (not 1, ok). But J is a new letter.

""HOIST"" - H, O, I, S, T. Similarly, H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

But we have to consider that in SPLIT, S was not at 1, but in HOIST it is at 4, which is fine.

But we might want to test if S can be at position 2 or 3.

For example, a word like ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T. But S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 because in SPLIT feedback, S was present but not at 1, meaning it is in the word but not the first letter. So S cannot be at position 1. Therefore, ""SIGHT"" is invalid because it has S at 1.

Similarly, ""SIXTH"" has S at 1, not allowed.

What about ""WAIST"" - W, A, I, S, T. But A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback, A is absent), so cannot use A.

""EXIST"" - E is eliminated.

""UNLIT"" - U, N, L, I, T. But N and L are eliminated.

So, not possible.

""OMITS"" - O, M, I, T, S. But this ends with S, not T. We need to end with T.

We need a word ending with T.

""FOCUS"" doesn't end with T.

""ADMIT"" has A and D, but A is eliminated.

""LIMIT"" has L, which is eliminated.

""VISIT"" - V, I, S, I, T? Wait, ""VISIT"" is V1,I2,S3,I4,T5? But it has two I's? No, ""VISIT"" has V,I,S,I,T — positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. But it has two I's? No, it's V-I-S-I-T, so only one I? Wait, no: V, I, S, I, T — that's two I's? Let me spell: V-I-S-I-T, yes, it has two I's. But the word is ""VISIT"", which is V-I-S-I-T? No, ""VISIT"" is V-I-S-I-T? That's 5 letters: V, I, S, I, T — but it has two I's. Is that allowed? The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in feedback, we don't know. However, in our case, from SPLIT, we have I as present, but it doesn't specify if there is one or two. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But ""VISIT"" has two I's, which might complicate. Also, position 4 is I, but in feedback for SPLIT, I was at position 4 and marked as wrong position, meaning that I is not at position 4. But if the word has two I's, it could be that one is at position 4 and another elsewhere, but the feedback for position 4 would still be wrong if it's not the correct instance. However, the feedback symbol is per position, so if there is an I at position 4, it would be marked as correct if it is in the right place, or wrong position if it is in the word but that instance is misplaced. But in SPLIT, we had I at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that I is in the word but not at position 4. So if the secret word has an I at position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it was not, so position 4 is not I. Therefore, in ""VISIT"", if we guess it, position 4 is I, which would be incorrect if the secret word doesn't have I at 4, but it might have I elsewhere. However, since we know I is in the word, but not at 4, it's fine, but ""VISIT"" has I at position 2 and 4, so position 4 I would be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one I and it's not at 4, or if it has two, it might be correct or wrong. But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Moreover, ""VISIT"" has V, which is available, but let's not use it yet.

Back to ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. Positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

This seems good because:
- It ends with T (position 5 correct).
- S is at position 4, which is not 1, so that's fine.
- I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine.
- It uses M and O, which are new letters.

We can get feedback on M, O, and also confirm S and I positions.

Another possibility: ""JOIST"" or ""HOIST"", similar.

But ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T: H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

Same positions.

""FOIST"" - F, O, I, S, T: F1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

All are similar.

We could try to put S at position 2 or 3.

For example, ""USUAL"" doesn't end with T.

""GUEST"" has E, eliminated.

""OASIS"" doesn't end with T.

""POSIT"" - P is eliminated.

""SUITE"" has E.

""QUITS"" - Q, U, I, T, S. Ends with S, not T.

""QUIET"" has E.

It's hard to find words with S at position 2 or 3 and ending with T.

For example, ""EXIST"" has E.

""MOIST"" and its variants might be the best.

Another word: ""TWIST"" - T, W, I, S, T. But it ends with T, and starts with T? T at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if T is duplicated. Also, in ""TWIST"", position 1 is T, but we don't have information about T at position 1. However, from SPLIT, we know T is at position 5, but it might be elsewhere? The feedback for T in SPLIT was correct at position 5, but it doesn't say if there are other T's. So it could have another T.

But in ""TWIST"", if we guess it, position 1 is T, which might be correct or not.

But we also have S at position 4 and I at position 3.

But ""TWIST"" has W and I, S, T.

W is a new letter.

But let's see: if we guess ""TWIST"", positions: T1, W2, I3, S4, T5.

Now, we know T is at position 5, so position 1 T might be a duplicate or not.

But in terms of feedback, if the secret word has only one T at position 5, then position 1 T would be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? If there is only one T and it's at 5, then T at 1 would be marked as wrong position only if there is another T, but since there is only one, it should be absent? No.

Feedback rules:
- If the letter is in the correct position, it's ✓.
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it's -.
- If the letter is not in the word, it's x.

If the secret word has only one T at position 5, and we guess T at position 1, then since position 1 is not correct, and there is no other T (only one at 5), so the T at position 1 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no T available for that position (the only T is used at position 5).

But in the feedback, for a guess, each position is evaluated independently, but with the constraint that multiple occurrences are handled carefully.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one T and you guess two T's, one in correct position and one not, the correct position gets ✓, and the other might get x if there is no extra T.

But it can be tricky.

To avoid confusion, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a safe choice.

""HOIST"" is also good.

I think I'll go with ""HOIST"" because H is a common consonant.

But let's see available letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information.

""HOIST"" uses H, O, I, S, T.

I is already known, S is known, T is known at end, so we are testing H and O.

Similarly, ""MOIST"" tests M and O.

""FOIST"" tests F and O.

O is a vowel, which might be useful.

Another word: ""SUITY"" not a word.

""DUSTY"" has D, U, S, T, Y. But S is at position 3, T at 5, and U and Y are new. But I is not in this word, but we know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess to get information about its position.

We must include both S and I because they are present, and we need to find their positions.

Therefore, the next guess must include S and I, and end with T, and avoid eliminated letters.

So, words like HOIST, MOIST, FOIST, JOIST, etc.

I think HOIST is a valid word.

Similarly, MOIST.

Let's choose MOIST.

But in MOIST, S is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested for S yet (we only know it's not at 1).

Similarly, I is at position 3.

We can get feedback on whether S is at 4 or not, and I at 3 or not.

If MOIST gets good feedback, we might solve it.

But let's not assume.

I'll go with MOIST.

So, guess: MOIST

But to write it in the response.

<guess>MOIST</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are eliminated.
- From Guess 2 (SPLT): 
  - S is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
  - P and L are absent, so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (not position 4).
  - T is correct and in position 5.

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5 is fixed).
- S and I are in the word, but S cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.
- Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S, I, T confirmed in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and I (to test their positions) and end with T.
- Avoid eliminated letters.
- S must not be in position 1, and I must not be in position 4.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (e.g., M, O) and possible positions for S and I.

""MOIST"" is chosen because:
- It ends with T (position 5), satisfying the known correct position.
- It places S in position 4 (not position 1, which is allowed) and I in position 3 (not position 4, which is allowed).
- It introduces new letters M (position 1) and O (position 2), which are common and untested.
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, P, L).
- Feedback on M and O will help narrow down possibilities further.

<guess>MOIST</guess>",MOIST,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. SPLIT: 
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: absent (x)
   - I: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: correct position (✓) at the last position.

So, from SPLIT:
- T is in the word and is in the 5th position (correct).
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- I is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- P and L are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- It contains S and I, but S is not at position 1, and I is not at position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Ends with T (since position 5 is T).
- Includes S and I (which we know are present) but not in positions we know they are wrong (S not at 1, I not at 4).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Also, we have to consider the positions for S and I.

Since S is not at position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, I is not at position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ T.

We know S is in the word but not position 1, so S is in {2,3,4}.
I is in the word but not position 4, so I is in {1,2,3}.

Also, we need to include both S and I in the guess, and we can add other letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T which we know are in, but T is fixed at the end).

But we have to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly the letters we know: at least S, I, T, and two other letters from the available set.

Since we have two positions to fill (besides the known T at the end) and we know S and I must be placed, but we don't know their positions yet.

In the next guess, we should try to place S and I in positions that are possible and test new letters for the remaining positions.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback), and it could be I or a new letter.
- Position 4: cannot be I (from feedback), and it could be S or a new letter.

We have to guess a word that ends with T, and has S and I in it, with S not at 1 and I not at 4.

Also, we should avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's think of words ending with T that contain S and I.

For example:
- ""MOIST"" but M is available, but ""MOIST"" has O and I, but in ""MOIST"": positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in our feedback for SPLIT, S was marked as present but not position 1, which is consistent, but I was marked as present but not position 4.

But in our previous guess SPLIT, we had S at position 1 (which was wrong position) and I at position 4 (which was wrong position). Now in ""MOIST"", S is at position 4 and I at position 3. Since I is at 3, which is not 4, that's fine. S is at 4, which is not 1, also fine.

But we need to see if this tests new letters. ""MOIST"" has M and O, which are new.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that places S and I in different positions to test other possibilities.

For instance, if we put I at position 1, which is allowed, and S at position 2 or 3.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J, O, I, S, T. J is less common, but possible. Positions: J1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in this case, I is at 3 (not 4, ok), S at 4 (not 1, ok). But J is a new letter.

""HOIST"" - H, O, I, S, T. Similarly, H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

But we have to consider that in SPLIT, S was not at 1, but in HOIST it is at 4, which is fine.

But we might want to test if S can be at position 2 or 3.

For example, a word like ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T. But S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 because in SPLIT feedback, S was present but not at 1, meaning it is in the word but not the first letter. So S cannot be at position 1. Therefore, ""SIGHT"" is invalid because it has S at 1.

Similarly, ""SIXTH"" has S at 1, not allowed.

What about ""WAIST"" - W, A, I, S, T. But A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback, A is absent), so cannot use A.

""EXIST"" - E is eliminated.

""UNLIT"" - U, N, L, I, T. But N and L are eliminated.

So, not possible.

""OMITS"" - O, M, I, T, S. But this ends with S, not T. We need to end with T.

We need a word ending with T.

""FOCUS"" doesn't end with T.

""ADMIT"" has A and D, but A is eliminated.

""LIMIT"" has L, which is eliminated.

""VISIT"" - V, I, S, I, T? Wait, ""VISIT"" is V1,I2,S3,I4,T5? But it has two I's? No, ""VISIT"" has V,I,S,I,T — positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. But it has two I's? No, it's V-I-S-I-T, so only one I? Wait, no: V, I, S, I, T — that's two I's? Let me spell: V-I-S-I-T, yes, it has two I's. But the word is ""VISIT"", which is V-I-S-I-T? No, ""VISIT"" is V-I-S-I-T?

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Moreover, ""VISIT"" has V, which is available, but let's not use it yet.

Back to ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. Positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

This seems good because:

- S is at position 4, which is not 1, so that's fine.

We can get feedback on M, O, and also confirm S and I positions.

W is a new letter.

But let's see: if we guess ""TWIST"", positions: T1, W2, I3, S4, T5.

Now, we know T is at position 5, so position 1 T might be a duplicate or not.

But in terms of feedback, if the secret word has only one T at position 5, then position 1 T would be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? If there is only one T and it's at 5, then T at 1 would be marked as wrong position only if there is another T, but since there is only one, it should be absent? No.

Feedback rules:
- If the letter is in the correct position, it's ✓.
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it's -.
- If the letter is not in the word, it's x.

If the secret word has only one T at position 5, and we guess T at position 1, then since position 1 is not correct, and there is no other T (only one at 5), so the T at position 1 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no T available for that position (the only T is used at position 5).

But in the feedback, for a guess, each position is evaluated independently, but with the constraint that multiple occurrences are handled carefully.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one T and you guess two T's, one in correct position and one not, the correct position gets ✓, and the other might get x if there is no extra T.

But it can be tricky.

To avoid confusion, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a safe choice.

""HOIST"" is also good.

I think I'll go with ""HOIST"" because H is a common consonant.

But let's see available letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information.

""HOIST"" uses H, O, I, S, T.

I is already known, S is known, T is known at end, so we are testing H and O.

Similarly, ""MOIST"" tests M and O.

""FOIST"" tests F and O.

O is a vowel, which might be useful.

Another word: ""SUITY"" not a word.

""DUSTY"" has D, U, S, T, Y. But S is at position 3, T at 5, and U and Y are new. But I is not in this word, but we know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess to get information about its position.

We must include both S and I because they are present, and we need to find their positions.

Therefore, the next guess must include S and I, and end with T, and avoid eliminated letters.

So, words like HOIST, MOIST, FOIST, JOIST, etc.

I think HOIST is a valid word.

Similarly, MOIST.

Let's choose MOIST.

But in MOIST, S is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested for S yet (we only know it's not at 1).

Similarly, I is at position 3.

We can get feedback on whether S is at 4 or not, and I at 3 or not.

If MOIST gets good feedback, we might solve it.

But let's not assume.

I'll go with MOIST.

So, guess: MOIST

But to write it in the response.

<guess>MOIST</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are eliminated.
- From Guess 2 (SPLT): 
  - S is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
  - P and L are absent, so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (not position 4).
  - T is correct and in position 5.

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5 is fixed).
- S and I are in the word, but S cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.
- Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S, I, T confirmed in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and I (to test their positions) and end with T.
- Avoid eliminated letters.
- S must not be in position 1, and I must not be in position 4.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (e.g., M, O) and possible positions for S and I.

""MOIST"" is chosen because:
- It ends with T (position 5), satisfying the known correct position.
- It places S in position 4 (not position 1, which is allowed) and I in position 3 (not position 4, which is allowed).
- It introduces new letters M (position 1) and O (position 2), which are common and untested.
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, P, L).
- Feedback on M and O will help narrow down possibilities further.",Guess 3: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) I(-) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,midst,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We'll start with a common starting word that has a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" as it includes common letters.
But note: feedback format: ✓ for correct position, - for correct letter wrong position, x for absent.
We have 6 tries.

Since we are at the first guess, any word is acceptable. Let's choose ""CRANE"".

The thought process:
1. ""CRANE"" has the letters C, R, A, N, E.
2. These are common letters and will help eliminate or identify vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).
3. We'll use the feedback to refine our next guess.

So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)
This means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Now, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. We should pick a word that uses other common letters to gain more information.

Common letters that are still available include: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

A good second guess should have letters that we haven't tested yet and that are likely to appear in 5-letter words.

Let's think of a word without C, R, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- ""SLOTH"": Uses S, L, O, T, H
- ""PIOUS"": Uses P, I, O, U, S
- ""DUMPY"": Uses D, U, M, P, Y

But note: We want to maximize the coverage of new letters.

Another classic second guess after eliminating some vowels is to use other vowels and consonants.

Since A and E are eliminated (common vowels), we have other vowels: O, I, U, and sometimes Y.

But U and Y are less common. O and I are good choices.

Also, consonants like S, T, L are very common.

So, a word like ""TULIP"" might be good? But T in CRANE was not present? Wait, in our feedback R is x, but T wasn't tested. CRANE didn't have T, so T is still possible.

CRANE had C, R, A, N, E -> all x, so T, O, I, etc. are untouched.

Let's choose a word that includes O and I since we haven't tested those vowels.

Possible words: ""POIST"" but that's not a word. ""JOIST"" - J might not be common. ""MOIST"" is good.

MOIST: M, O, I, S, T

This would test M, O, I, S, T - all new letters.

Another option: ""GHOUL"" but G and H are less common and U is less common.

""LIGHT"" - L, I, G, H, T - G and H are less common.

""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S - U is a vowel but might be less frequent.

""MOIST"" seems solid because O and I are vowels and S, T are common consonants.

We also can consider ""SLIPT"" but not common. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - P and L are good.

But ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - that's five new letters.

Similarly, ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T.

Both are effective.

I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it avoids M which might be less common than P or L? But actually, S, P, L, I, T are all very common.

""SPLIT"" has two consonants that could be in many positions.

Alternatively, we can think about the word list.

Since we have eliminated five letters, including two vowels (A and E), we should use other vowels: O and I.

Let me choose ""SPLIT"" because it has common letters and covers a good set.

But ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T. All new and common.

We could choose ""CHUMP"" but C is already eliminated, so no.

C is eliminated, so no C.

So, ""SPLIT"" is valid.

Another option: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. U and B might be less common.

I think ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"" are both fine.

I'll go with ""SPLIT"".

But wait, what about ""POINT""? P, O, I, N, T - but N was eliminated! In CRANE, N was x, so N is not in the word. We cannot use N.

Similarly, A, E, R, C are out.

So in ""POINT"", N is not allowed because feedback said N(x), meaning not in the word. Therefore, we cannot use letters that were x.

So, avoid C, R, A, N, E.

That rules out ""POINT"" because of N.

""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T - none of the eliminated letters.

""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - also acceptable.

Let's choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.

So, guess: SPLIT

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters and focus on other common 5-letter English words using untested letters to maximize information gain. I'll select ""SPLIT"" because it:
- Uses new common letters: S, P, L, I, T (all not tested yet).
- Covers high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and the vowel I.
- Avoids eliminated letters, ensuring no wasted guess.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SPLIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.

2. SPLIT: 
   - S: present but wrong position (-)
   - P: absent (x)
   - L: absent (x)
   - I: present but wrong position (-)
   - T: correct position (✓) at the last position.

So, from SPLIT:
- T is in the word and is in the 5th position (correct).
- S is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- I is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- P and L are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- It contains S and I, but S is not at position 1, and I is not at position 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Now, we need to think of a new word that:
- Ends with T (since position 5 is T).
- Includes S and I (which we know are present) but not in positions we know they are wrong (S not at 1, I not at 4).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Also, we have to consider the positions for S and I.

Since S is not at position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, I is not at position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.

Let me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ T.

We know S is in the word but not position 1, so S is in {2,3,4}.
I is in the word but not position 4, so I is in {1,2,3}.

Also, we need to include both S and I in the guess, and we can add other letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T which we know are in, but T is fixed at the end).

But we have to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly the letters we know: at least S, I, T, and two other letters from the available set.

Since we have two positions to fill (besides the known T at the end) and we know S and I must be placed, but we don't know their positions yet.

In the next guess, we should try to place S and I in positions that are possible and test new letters for the remaining positions.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback), and it could be I or a new letter.
- Position 4: cannot be I (from feedback), and it could be S or a new letter.

We have to guess a word that ends with T, and has S and I in it, with S not at 1 and I not at 4.

Also, we should avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's think of words ending with T that contain S and I.

For example:
- ""MOIST"" but M is available, but ""MOIST"" has O and I, but in ""MOIST"": positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in our feedback for SPLIT, S was marked as present but not position 1, which is consistent, but I was marked as present but not position 4. In ""MOIST"", I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine. However, we have feedback that P and L are absent, and ""MOIST"" doesn't have P or L, so it's okay. But we also have to check if it uses any eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,L are eliminated. ""MOIST"" has M,O,I,S,T - none of these are eliminated, so it's a candidate.

But in our previous guess SPLIT, we had S at position 1 (which was wrong position) and I at position 4 (which was wrong position). Now in ""MOIST"", S is at position 4 and I at position 3. Since I is at 3, which is not 4, that's fine. S is at 4, which is not 1, also fine.

But we need to see if this tests new letters. ""MOIST"" has M and O, which are new.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that places S and I in different positions to test other possibilities.

For instance, if we put I at position 1, which is allowed, and S at position 2 or 3.

But let's list possible words.

Another word: ""JOIST"" - J, O, I, S, T. J is less common, but possible. Positions: J1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in this case, I is at 3 (not 4, ok), S at 4 (not 1, ok). But J is a new letter.

""HOIST"" - H, O, I, S, T. Similarly, H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

But we have to consider that in SPLIT, S was not at 1, but in HOIST it is at 4, which is fine.

But we might want to test if S can be at position 2 or 3.

For example, a word like ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T. But S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 because in SPLIT feedback, S was present but not at 1, meaning it is in the word but not the first letter. So S cannot be at position 1. Therefore, ""SIGHT"" is invalid because it has S at 1.

Similarly, ""SIXTH"" has S at 1, not allowed.

What about ""WAIST"" - W, A, I, S, T. But A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback, A is absent), so cannot use A.

""EXIST"" - E is eliminated.

""UNLIT"" - U, N, L, I, T. But N and L are eliminated.

So, not possible.

""OMITS"" - O, M, I, T, S. But this ends with S, not T. We need to end with T.

We need a word ending with T.

""FOCUS"" doesn't end with T.

""ADMIT"" has A and D, but A is eliminated.

""LIMIT"" has L, which is eliminated.

""VISIT"" - V, I, S, I, T? Wait, ""VISIT"" is V1,I2,S3,I4,T5? But it has two I's? No, ""VISIT"" has V,I,S,I,T — positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. But it has two I's? No, it's V-I-S-I-T, so only one I? Wait, no: V, I, S, I, T — that's two I's? Let me spell: V-I-S-I-T, yes, it has two I's. But the word is ""VISIT"", which is V-I-S-I-T? No, ""VISIT"" is V-I-S-I-T? That's 5 letters: V, I, S, I, T — but it has two I's. Is that allowed? The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in feedback, we don't know. However, in our case, from SPLIT, we have I as present, but it doesn't specify if there is one or two. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But ""VISIT"" has two I's, which might complicate. Also, position 4 is I, but in feedback for SPLIT, I was at position 4 and marked as wrong position, meaning that I is not at position 4. But if the word has two I's, it could be that one is at position 4 and another elsewhere, but the feedback for position 4 would still be wrong if it's not the correct instance. However, the feedback symbol is per position, so if there is an I at position 4, it would be marked as correct if it is in the right place, or wrong position if it is in the word but that instance is misplaced. But in SPLIT, we had I at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that I is in the word but not at position 4. So if the secret word has an I at position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it was not, so position 4 is not I. Therefore, in ""VISIT"", if we guess it, position 4 is I, which would be incorrect if the secret word doesn't have I at 4, but it might have I elsewhere. However, since we know I is in the word, but not at 4, it's fine, but ""VISIT"" has I at position 2 and 4, so position 4 I would be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one I and it's not at 4, or if it has two, it might be correct or wrong. But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Moreover, ""VISIT"" has V, which is available, but let's not use it yet.

Back to ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. Positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

This seems good because:
- It ends with T (position 5 correct).
- S is at position 4, which is not 1, so that's fine.
- I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that's fine.
- It uses M and O, which are new letters.

We can get feedback on M, O, and also confirm S and I positions.

Another possibility: ""JOIST"" or ""HOIST"", similar.

But ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T: H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

Same positions.

""FOIST"" - F, O, I, S, T: F1, O2, I3, S4, T5.

All are similar.

We could try to put S at position 2 or 3.

For example, ""USUAL"" doesn't end with T.

""GUEST"" has E, eliminated.

""OASIS"" doesn't end with T.

""POSIT"" - P is eliminated.

""SUITE"" has E.

""QUITS"" - Q, U, I, T, S. Ends with S, not T.

""QUIET"" has E.

It's hard to find words with S at position 2 or 3 and ending with T.

For example, ""EXIST"" has E.

""MOIST"" and its variants might be the best.

Another word: ""TWIST"" - T, W, I, S, T. But it ends with T, and starts with T? T at position 1 and 5? But we don't know if T is duplicated. Also, in ""TWIST"", position 1 is T, but we don't have information about T at position 1. However, from SPLIT, we know T is at position 5, but it might be elsewhere? The feedback for T in SPLIT was correct at position 5, but it doesn't say if there are other T's. So it could have another T.

But in ""TWIST"", if we guess it, position 1 is T, which might be correct or not.

But we also have S at position 4 and I at position 3.

But ""TWIST"" has W and I, S, T.

W is a new letter.

But let's see: if we guess ""TWIST"", positions: T1, W2, I3, S4, T5.

Now, we know T is at position 5, so position 1 T might be a duplicate or not.

But in terms of feedback, if the secret word has only one T at position 5, then position 1 T would be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? If there is only one T and it's at 5, then T at 1 would be marked as wrong position only if there is another T, but since there is only one, it should be absent? No.

Feedback rules:
- If the letter is in the correct position, it's ✓.
- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it's -.
- If the letter is not in the word, it's x.

If the secret word has only one T at position 5, and we guess T at position 1, then since position 1 is not correct, and there is no other T (only one at 5), so the T at position 1 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no T available for that position (the only T is used at position 5).

But in the feedback, for a guess, each position is evaluated independently, but with the constraint that multiple occurrences are handled carefully.

Standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one T and you guess two T's, one in correct position and one not, the correct position gets ✓, and the other might get x if there is no extra T.

But it can be tricky.

To avoid confusion, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a safe choice.

""HOIST"" is also good.

I think I'll go with ""HOIST"" because H is a common consonant.

But let's see available letters.

Since we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information.

""HOIST"" uses H, O, I, S, T.

I is already known, S is known, T is known at end, so we are testing H and O.

Similarly, ""MOIST"" tests M and O.

""FOIST"" tests F and O.

O is a vowel, which might be useful.

Another word: ""SUITY"" not a word.

""DUSTY"" has D, U, S, T, Y. But S is at position 3, T at 5, and U and Y are new. But I is not in this word, but we know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess to get information about its position.

We must include both S and I because they are present, and we need to find their positions.

Therefore, the next guess must include S and I, and end with T, and avoid eliminated letters.

So, words like HOIST, MOIST, FOIST, JOIST, etc.

I think HOIST is a valid word.

Similarly, MOIST.

Let's choose MOIST.

But in MOIST, S is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested for S yet (we only know it's not at 1).

Similarly, I is at position 3.

We can get feedback on whether S is at 4 or not, and I at 3 or not.

If MOIST gets good feedback, we might solve it.

But let's not assume.

I'll go with MOIST.

So, guess: MOIST

But to write it in the response.

<guess>MOIST</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are eliminated.
- From Guess 2 (SPLT): 
  - S is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
  - P and L are absent, so they are eliminated.
  - I is present but in the wrong position (not position 4).
  - T is correct and in position 5.

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5 is fixed).
- S and I are in the word, but S cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.
- Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S, I, T confirmed in the word).

For the next guess:
- Must include S and I (to test their positions) and end with T.
- Avoid eliminated letters.
- S must not be in position 1, and I must not be in position 4.
- To maximize information, test new common letters (e.g., M, O) and possible positions for S and I.

""MOIST"" is chosen because:
- It ends with T (position 5), satisfying the known correct position.
- It places S in position 4 (not position 1, which is allowed) and I in position 3 (not position 4, which is allowed).
- It introduces new letters M (position 1) and O (position 2), which are common and untested.
- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, P, L).
- Feedback on M and O will help narrow down possibilities further.

We\'ll use the feedback to refine our next guess.\n\nSo, the first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nThis means that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\nNow, we need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. We should pick a word that uses other common letters to gain more information.\n\nCommon letters that are still available include: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\nA good second guess should have letters that we haven\'t tested yet and that are likely to appear in 5-letter words.\n\nLet\'s think of a word without C, R, A, N, E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""SLOTH"": Uses S, L, O, T, H\n- ""PIOUS"": Uses P, I, O, U, S\n- ""DUMPY"": Uses D, U, M, P, Y\n\nBut note: We want to maximize the coverage of new letters.\n\nAnother classic second guess after eliminating some vowels is to use other vowels and consonants.\n\nSince A and E are eliminated (common vowels), we have other vowels: O, I, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nBut U and Y are less common. O and I are good choices.\n\nAlso, consonants like S, T, L are very common.\n\nSo, a word like ""TULIP"" might be good? But T in CRANE was not present? Wait, in our feedback R is x, but T wasn\'t tested. CRANE didn\'t have T, so T is still possible.\n\nCRANE had C, R, A, N, E -> all x, so T, O, I, etc. are untouched.\n\nLet\'s choose a word that includes O and I since we haven\'t tested those vowels.\n\nPossible words: ""POIST"" but that\'s not a word. ""JOIST"" - J might not be common. ""MOIST"" is good.\n\nMOIST: M, O, I, S, T\n\nThis would test M, O, I, S, T - all new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""GHOUL"" but G and H are less common and U is less common.\n\n""LIGHT"" - L, I, G, H, T - G and H are less common.\n\n""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S - U is a vowel but might be less frequent.\n\n""MOIST"" seems solid because O and I are vowels and S, T are common consonants.\n\nWe also can consider ""SLIPT"" but not common. ""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - P and L are good.\n\nBut ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T - that\'s five new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOIST"" uses M, O, I, S, T.\n\nBoth are effective.\n\nI think ""SPLIT"" is better because it avoids M which might be less common than P or L? But actually, S, P, L, I, T are all very common.\n\n""SPLIT"" has two consonants that could be in many positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the word list.\n\nSince we have eliminated five letters, including two vowels (A and E), we should use other vowels: O and I.\n\nLet me choose ""SPLIT"" because it has common letters and covers a good set.\n\nBut ""SPLIT"" uses S, P, L, I, T. All new and common.\n\nWe could choose ""CHUMP"" but C is already eliminated, so no.\n\nC is eliminated, so no C.\n\nSo, ""SPLIT"" is valid.\n\nAnother option: ""DOUBT"" - D, O, U, B, T. U and B might be less common.\n\nI think ""SPLIT"" or ""MOIST"" are both fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPLIT"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""POINT""? P, O, I, N, T - but N was eliminated! In CRANE, N was x, so N is not in the word. We cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, A, E, R, C are out.\n\nSo in ""POINT"", N is not allowed because feedback said N(x), meaning not in the word. Therefore, we cannot use letters that were x.\n\nSo, avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\nThat rules out ""POINT"" because of N.\n\n""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T - none of the eliminated letters.\n\n""SPLIT"" has S, P, L, I, T - also acceptable.\n\nLet\'s choose ""SPLIT"" as the next guess.\n\nSo, guess: SPLIT\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the previous feedback for ""CRANE"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess, I need to avoid these letters and focus on other common 5-letter English words using untested letters to maximize information gain. I\'ll select ""SPLIT"" because it:\n- Uses new common letters: S, P, L, I, T (all not tested yet).\n- Covers high-frequency consonants (S, T, L) and the vowel I.\n- Avoids eliminated letters, ensuring no wasted guess.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>SPLIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

Similarly, I is not at position 4, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 5 is T.\n\nLet me denote the secret word as _ _ _ _ T.\n\nWe know S is in the word but not position 1, so S is in {2,3,4}.\nI is in the word but not position 4, so I is in {1,2,3}.\n\nAlso, we need to include both S and I in the guess, and we can add other letters that are not eliminated.\n\nEliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T which we know are in, but T is fixed at the end).\n\nBut we have to form a valid English word.\n\nWe also know that the word must have exactly the letters we know: at least S, I, T, and two other letters from the available set.\n\nSince we have two positions to fill (besides the known T at the end) and we know S and I must be placed, but we don\'t know their positions yet.\n\nIn the next guess, we should try to place S and I in positions that are possible and test new letters for the remaining positions.\n\nPossible positions:\n- Position 1: cannot be S (from feedback), and it could be I or a new letter.\n- Position 4: cannot be I (from feedback), and it could be S or a new letter.\n\nWe have to guess a word that ends with T, and has S and I in it, with S not at 1 and I not at 4.\n\nAlso, we should avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with T that contain S and I.\n\nFor example:\n- ""MOIST"" but M is available, but ""MOIST"" has O and I, but in ""MOIST"": positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in our feedback for SPLIT, S was marked as present but not position 1, which is consistent, but I was marked as present but not position 4. In ""MOIST"", I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that\'s fine. However, we have feedback that P and L are absent, and ""MOIST"" doesn\'t have P or L, so it\'s okay. But we also have to check if it uses any eliminated letters: C,R,A,N,E,P,L are eliminated. ""MOIST"" has M,O,I,S,T - none of these are eliminated, so it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut in our previous guess SPLIT, we had S at position 1 (which was wrong position) and I at position 4 (which was wrong position). Now in ""MOIST"", S is at position 4 and I at position 3. Since I is at 3, which is not 4, that\'s fine. S is at 4, which is not 1, also fine.\n\nBut we need to see if this tests new letters. ""MOIST"" has M and O, which are new.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that places S and I in different positions to test other possibilities.\n\nFor instance, if we put I at position 1, which is allowed, and S at position 2 or 3.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nAnother word: ""JOIST"" - J, O, I, S, T. J is less common, but possible. Positions: J1, O2, I3, S4, T5. But in this case, I is at 3 (not 4, ok), S at 4 (not 1, ok). But J is a new letter.\n\n""HOIST"" - H, O, I, S, T. Similarly, H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nBut we have to consider that in SPLIT, S was not at 1, but in HOIST it is at 4, which is fine.\n\nBut we might want to test if S can be at position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, a word like ""SIGHT"" - S, I, G, H, T. But S is at position 1, but we know S cannot be at position 1 because in SPLIT feedback, S was present but not at 1, meaning it is in the word but not the first letter. So S cannot be at position 1. Therefore, ""SIGHT"" is invalid because it has S at 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""SIXTH"" has S at 1, not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""WAIST"" - W, A, I, S, T. But A is eliminated (from CRANE feedback, A is absent), so cannot use A.\n\n""EXIST"" - E is eliminated.\n\n""UNLIT"" - U, N, L, I, T. But N and L are eliminated.\n\nSo, not possible.\n\n""OMITS"" - O, M, I, T, S. But this ends with S, not T. We need to end with T.\n\nWe need a word ending with T.\n\n""FOCUS"" doesn\'t end with T.\n\n""ADMIT"" has A and D, but A is eliminated.\n\n""LIMIT"" has L, which is eliminated.\n\n""VISIT"" - V, I, S, I, T? Wait, ""VISIT"" is V1,I2,S3,I4,T5? But it has two I\'s? No, ""VISIT"" has V,I,S,I,T — positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. But it has two I\'s? No, it\'s V-I-S-I-T, so only one I? Wait, no: V, I, S, I, T — that\'s two I\'s? Let me spell: V-I-S-I-T, yes, it has two I\'s. But the word is ""VISIT"", which is V-I-S-I-T? No, ""VISIT"" is V-I-S-I-T? That\'s 5 letters: V, I, S, I, T — but it has two I\'s. Is that allowed? The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in feedback, we don\'t know. However, in our case, from SPLIT, we have I as present, but it doesn\'t specify if there is one or two. But we should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut ""VISIT"" has two I\'s, which might complicate. Also, position 4 is I, but in feedback for SPLIT, I was at position 4 and marked as wrong position, meaning that I is not at position 4. But if the word has two I\'s, it could be that one is at position 4 and another elsewhere, but the feedback for position 4 would still be wrong if it\'s not the correct instance. However, the feedback symbol is per position, so if there is an I at position 4, it would be marked as correct if it is in the right place, or wrong position if it is in the word but that instance is misplaced. But in SPLIT, we had I at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that I is in the word but not at position 4. So if the secret word has an I at position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it was not, so position 4 is not I. Therefore, in ""VISIT"", if we guess it, position 4 is I, which would be incorrect if the secret word doesn\'t have I at 4, but it might have I elsewhere. However, since we know I is in the word, but not at 4, it\'s fine, but ""VISIT"" has I at position 2 and 4, so position 4 I would be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one I and it\'s not at 4, or if it has two, it might be correct or wrong. But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.\n\nMoreover, ""VISIT"" has V, which is available, but let\'s not use it yet.\n\nBack to ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T. Positions: M1, O2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nThis seems good because:\n- It ends with T (position 5 correct).\n- S is at position 4, which is not 1, so that\'s fine.\n- I is at position 3, which is not 4, so that\'s fine.\n- It uses M and O, which are new letters.\n\nWe can get feedback on M, O, and also confirm S and I positions.\n\nAnother possibility: ""JOIST"" or ""HOIST"", similar.\n\nBut ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T: H1, O2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nSame positions.\n\n""FOIST"" - F, O, I, S, T: F1, O2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nAll are similar.\n\nWe could try to put S at position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, ""USUAL"" doesn\'t end with T.\n\n""GUEST"" has E, eliminated.\n\n""OASIS"" doesn\'t end with T.\n\n""POSIT"" - P is eliminated.\n\n""SUITE"" has E.\n\n""QUITS"" - Q, U, I, T, S. Ends with S, not T.\n\n""QUIET"" has E.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with S at position 2 or 3 and ending with T.\n\nFor example, ""EXIST"" has E.\n\n""MOIST"" and its variants might be the best.\n\nAnother word: ""TWIST"" - T, W, I, S, T. But it ends with T, and starts with T? T at position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know if T is duplicated. Also, in ""TWIST"", position 1 is T, but we don\'t have information about T at position 1. However, from SPLIT, we know T is at position 5, but it might be elsewhere? The feedback for T in SPLIT was correct at position 5, but it doesn\'t say if there are other T\'s. So it could have another T.\n\nBut in ""TWIST"", if we guess it, position 1 is T, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut we also have S at position 4 and I at position 3.\n\nBut ""TWIST"" has W and I, S, T.\n\nW is a new letter.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""TWIST"", positions: T1, W2, I3, S4, T5.\n\nNow, we know T is at position 5, so position 1 T might be a duplicate or not.\n\nBut in terms of feedback, if the secret word has only one T at position 5, then position 1 T would be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? If there is only one T and it\'s at 5, then T at 1 would be marked as wrong position only if there is another T, but since there is only one, it should be absent? No.\n\nFeedback rules:\n- If the letter is in the correct position, it\'s ✓.\n- If the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it\'s -.\n- If the letter is not in the word, it\'s x.\n\nIf the secret word has only one T at position 5, and we guess T at position 1, then since position 1 is not correct, and there is no other T (only one at 5), so the T at position 1 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no T available for that position (the only T is used at position 5).\n\nBut in the feedback, for a guess, each position is evaluated independently, but with the constraint that multiple occurrences are handled carefully.\n\nStandard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret has one T and you guess two T\'s, one in correct position and one not, the correct position gets ✓, and the other might get x if there is no extra T.\n\nBut it can be tricky.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps we should avoid words with duplicate letters for now.\n\nTherefore, ""MOIST"" is a safe choice.\n\n""HOIST"" is also good.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""HOIST"" because H is a common consonant.\n\nBut let\'s see available letters.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we need to maximize information.\n\n""HOIST"" uses H, O, I, S, T.\n\nI is already known, S is known, T is known at end, so we are testing H and O.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOIST"" tests M and O.\n\n""FOIST"" tests F and O.\n\nO is a vowel, which might be useful.\n\nAnother word: ""SUITY"" not a word.\n\n""DUSTY"" has D, U, S, T, Y. But S is at position 3, T at 5, and U and Y are new. But I is not in this word, but we know I must be in the word, so we have to include I in the guess to get information about its position.\n\nWe must include both S and I because they are present, and we need to find their positions.\n\nTherefore, the next guess must include S and I, and end with T, and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nSo, words like HOIST, MOIST, FOIST, JOIST, etc.\n\nI think HOIST is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, MOIST.\n\nLet\'s choose MOIST.\n\nBut in MOIST, S is at position 4, which is a position we haven\'t tested for S yet (we only know it\'s not at 1).\n\nSimilarly, I is at position 3.\n\nWe can get feedback on whether S is at 4 or not, and I at 3 or not.\n\nIf MOIST gets good feedback, we might solve it.\n\nBut let\'s not assume.\n\nI\'ll go with MOIST.\n\nSo, guess: MOIST\n\nBut to write it in the response.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent, so they are eliminated.\n- From Guess 2 (SPLT): \n  - S is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).\n  - P and L are absent, so they are eliminated.\n  - I is present but in the wrong position (not position 4).\n  - T is correct and in position 5.\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word ends with T (position 5 is fixed).\n- S and I are in the word, but S cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 4.\n- Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L.\n- Available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (with S, I, T confirmed in the word).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include S and I (to test their positions) and end with T.\n- Avoid eliminated letters.\n- S must not be in position 1, and I must not be in position 4.\n- To maximize information, test new common letters (e.g., M, O) and possible positions for S and I.\n\n""MOIST"" is chosen because:\n- It ends with T (position 5), satisfying the known correct position.\n- It places S in position 4 (not position 1, which is allowed) and I in position 3 (not position 4, which is allowed).\n- It introduces new letters M (position 1) and O (position 2), which are common and untested.\n- It avoids all eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, E, P, L).\n- Feedback on M and O will help narrow down possibilities further.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(-) T(✓)\nGuess 3: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) I(-) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E)
2. SPLIT: S present but not position 1, P absent, L absent, I present but not position 4, T correct at position 5
3. MOIST: M correct at position 1 (since M(✓)), O absent, I present but not position 3 (since I(-)), S correct at position 4 (S(✓)), T correct at position 5 (T(✓))

From MOIST feedback:
- M(✓): M is correct and in position 1.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(✓): S is correct and in position 4.
- T(✓): T is correct and in position 5.

Also, from SPLIT, we know that I cannot be in position 4, but now position 4 is S, so that's consistent.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: M
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T
- The word contains I, but not in position 3 (from MOIST, since we guessed I at position 3 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there), and also not in position 4 (from SPLIT, but position 4 is now known to be S).
- O is absent.

Therefore, the word so far: M _ _ S T

We know I must be in the word, and it can only be in position 2 or 3? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 1 is M, position 4 is S, position 5 is T, so I cannot be in position 3 because we guessed it there in MOIST and got wrong position, meaning it's not there.

Also, cannot be in position 4 since that's S.

Position 1 is M, occupied.

So I must be in position 2.

Because:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: open
- Position 3: open but I cannot be here (from MOIST feedback)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5, T

Therefore, I must be in position 2!

Because that's the only position left where I can be.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find for position 3.

So the word is M I _ S T? Not necessarily, because we haven't confirmed I at position 2 yet, but given that I must be in the word and position 3 is invalid, position 2 is the only possibility.

But we need to confirm.

In MOIST, we guessed position 3 as I and it said present but wrong position, so I is not in position 3.

Also, positions 1,4,5 are fixed, so yes, I must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is M I _ S T.

Now, we need to find the middle letter for position 3.

This letter must be one that has not been eliminated.

Eliminated letters from all feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (absent)
- From SPLIT: P, L (absent), and also from MOIST: O (absent)

Also, we know S and T are present, but they are placed.

M is placed.

I is present, to be placed at position 2.

So eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And the word must be a valid English word: M I ? S T

Common words: we can think of ""MIDST"", which is M-I-D-S-T.

D is available.

""MINTS"" but N is eliminated, and position 4 is S, so not.

""MILTS"" but L is eliminated.

""MISTS"" has two S's, but position 4 is S, and if we put S at position 3? But ""MISTS"" is M-I-S-S-T, so positions: M1, I2, S3, S4, T5. But S at position 3 and 4.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and it was correct, so if there is another S, it might be possible.

But let's consider the feedback.

In MOIST, we guessed S at position 4 correct, and T at 5 correct.

But for position 3, we guessed I and it was wrong.

If we guess ""MISTS"", position 3 is S, which might be correct or not.

However, D is available, and ""MIDST"" is a common word.

Other possibilities: ""MIGHT"" has G H T, but ends with T? ""MIGHT"" is M-I-G-H-T, so positions: M1,I2,G3,H4,T5. But position 4 is H, but we know position 4 must be S? From MOIST, S is correct at position 4, so position 4 must be S. Therefore, we cannot have H at position 4; it must be S.

So the word must have S at position 4, so any word with other letters at 4 is invalid.

Therefore, only words like M I X S T, where X is a letter for position 3.

Now, valid words: ""MIDST"" (meaning middle of).

""MIKST"" not a word.

""FISTS"" has F at position 1, not M.

So ""MIDST"" seems the most likely.

But are there others? ""MIST"" is 4 letters, no.

""MIXTS"" not word.

""MINTS"" has N, eliminated.

""MIHST"" not word.

""MIZST"" not.

So probably ""MIDST"" is the word.

But D is available, not eliminated.

We could guess ""MIDST"" directly.

But we have only one letter to find, and we can infer.

We have 6 tries total, this is guess 3 we received feedback, so next is guess 4.

We can guess ""MIDST"" to confirm.

To be safe, we might consider if there are other possibilities, but ""MIDST"" fits all the constraints.

Another word: ""WIST"" is not 5 letters.

Or ""KIST"" not common.

I think ""MIDST"" is the answer.

So let's guess ""MIDST"".

But to formalize the thought.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE):** All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT):** 
     - S is present but not in position 1 (±).
     - P and L are absent (×), so they are eliminated.
     - I is present but not in position 4 (±).
     - T is correct and in position 5 (✓).
   - **Guess 3 (MOIST):**
     - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).
     - O is absent (×), so it is eliminated.
     - I is present but not in position 3 (±).
     - S is correct and in position 4 (✓).
     - T is correct and in position 5 (✓).

2. **Current Knowledge:**
   - Fixed positions:
     - Position 1: M (from MOIST ✓).
     - Position 4: S (from MOIST ✓).
     - Position 5: T (from SPLIT ✓ and MOIST ✓).
   - Required letters:
     - I is present (from SPLIT ± and MOIST ±) but cannot be in position 3 (from MOIST ±) or position 4 (from SPLIT ±, which is now confirmed as S). Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are fixed, I must be in position 2 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, O (from all feedback). S, M, T, and I are confirmed present but may not all be placed yet except for M, S, and T.
   - The secret word must be: M I ? S T (with only position 3 unknown).
   - Position 3 requires a letter that:
     - Is not eliminated (available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
     - Forms a valid English word.

3. **Identify the Word:**
   - The partially known word is ""M I _ S T"".
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - ""MIDST"" is valid and likely (meaning ""middle of"" or a poetic term for center).
     - Other possibilities like ""MISTS"" (has duplicate S, but position 4 is S and it might conflict) or ""MINTS"" (has N, eliminated) are invalid due to eliminated letters or feedback. ""MIKST"", ""MIHST"", etc., are not words.
   - Since ""MIDST"" uses available letters (D is untested and not eliminated) and aligns with all constraints, it is the most probable guess.

4. **Next Guess Purpose:**
   - Guessing ""MIDST"" tests the only unknown position (D in position 3). If correct, it solves the puzzle based on current information.

<guess>MIDST</guess>",MIDST,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E)
2. SPLIT: S present but not position 1, P absent, L absent, I present but not position 4, T correct at position 5
3. MOIST: M correct at position 1 (since M(✓)), O absent, I present but not position 3 (since I(-)), S correct at position 4 (S(✓)), T correct at position 5 (T(✓))

From MOIST feedback:
- M(✓): M is correct and in position 1.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(✓): S is correct and in position 4.
- T(✓): T is correct and in position 5.

Also, from SPLIT, we know that I cannot be in position 4, but now position 4 is S, so that's consistent.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: M
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T
- The word contains I, but not in position 3 (from MOIST, since we guessed I at position 3 and got (-), meaning it's present but not there), and also not in position 4 (from SPLIT, but position 4 is now known to be S).
- O is absent.

Therefore, the word so far: M _ _ S T

We know I must be in the word, and it can only be in position 2 or 3? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 1 is M, position 4 is S, position 5 is T, so I cannot be in position 3 because we guessed it there in MOIST and got wrong position, meaning it's not there.

Also, cannot be in position 4 since that's S.

Position 1 is M, occupied.

So I must be in position 2.

Because:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: open
- Position 3: open but I cannot be here (from MOIST feedback)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5, T

Therefore, I must be in position 2!

Because that's the only position left where I can be.

Moreover, we have one more letter to find for position 3.

So the word is M I _ S T? Not necessarily, because we haven't confirmed I at position 2 yet, but given that I must be in the word and position 3 is invalid, position 2 is the only possibility.

But we need to confirm.

In MOIST, we guessed position 3 as I and it said present but wrong position, so I is not in position 3.

Also, positions 1,4,5 are fixed, so yes, I must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is M I _ S T.

Now, we need to find the middle letter for position 3.

This letter must be one that has not been eliminated.

Eliminated letters from all feedback:
- From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (absent)
- From SPLIT: P, L (absent), and also from MOIST: O (absent)

Also, we know S and T are present, but they are placed.

M is placed.

I is present, to be placed at position 2.

So eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, O.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And the word must be a valid English word: M I ? S T

Common words: we can think of ""MIDST"", which is M-I-D-S-T.

D is available.

""MINTS"" but N is eliminated, and position 4 is S, so not.

""MILTS"" but L is eliminated.

""MISTS"" has two S's, but position 4 is S, and if we put S at position 3? But ""MISTS"" is M-I-S-S-T, so positions: M1, I2, S3, S4, T5. But S at position 3 and 4.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and it was correct, so if there is another S, it might be possible.

But let's consider the feedback.

In MOIST, we guessed S at position 4 correct, and T at 5 correct.

But for position 3, we guessed I and it was wrong.

If we guess ""MISTS"", position 3 is S, which might be correct or not.

However, D is available, and ""MIDST"" is a common word.

Other possibilities: ""MIGHT"" has G H T, but ends with T? ""MIGHT"" is M-I-G-H-T, so positions: M1,I2,G3,H4,T5. But position 4 is H, but we know position 4 must be S? From MOIST, S is correct at position 4, so position 4 must be S. Therefore, we cannot have H at position 4; it must be S.

So the word must have S at position 4, so any word with other letters at 4 is invalid.

Therefore, only words like M I X S T, where X is a letter for position 3.

Now, valid words: ""MIDST"" (meaning middle of).

""MIKST"" not a word.

""FISTS"" has F at position 1, not M.

So ""MIDST"" seems the most likely.

But are there others? ""MIST"" is 4 letters, no.

""MIXTS"" not word.

""MINTS"" has N, eliminated.

""MIHST"" not word.

""MIZST"" not.

So probably ""MIDST"" is the word.

But D is available, not eliminated.

We could guess ""MIDST"" directly.

But we have only one letter to find, and we can infer.

We have 6 tries total, this is guess 3 we received feedback, so next is guess 4.

We can guess ""MIDST"" to confirm.

To be safe, we might consider if there are other possibilities, but ""MIDST"" fits all the constraints.

Another word: ""WIST"" is not 5 letters.

Or ""KIST"" not common.

I think ""MIDST"" is the answer.

So let's guess ""MIDST"".

But to formalize the thought.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE):** All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E eliminated). This means the secret word contains none of these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (SPLIT):** 
     - S is present but not in position 1 (±).
     - P and L are absent (×), so they are eliminated.
     - I is present but not in position 4 (±).
     - T is correct and in position 5 (✓).
   - **Guess 3 (MOIST):**
     - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).
     - O is absent (×), so it is eliminated.
     - I is present but not in position 3 (±).
     - S is correct and in position 4 (✓).
     - T is correct and in position 5 (✓).

2. **Current Knowledge:**
   - Fixed positions:
     - Position 1: M (from MOIST ✓).
     - Position 4: S (from MOIST ✓).
     - Position 5: T (from SPLIT ✓ and MOIST ✓).
   - Required letters:
     - I is present (from SPLIT ± and MOIST ±) but cannot be in position 3 (from MOIST ±) or position 4 (from SPLIT ±, which is now confirmed as S). Since positions 1, 4, and 5 are fixed, I must be in position 2 (the only remaining position where it can appear).
   - Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, O (from all feedback). S, M, T, and I are confirmed present but may not all be placed yet except for M, S, and T.
   - The secret word must be: M I ? S T (with only position 3 unknown).
   - Position 3 requires a letter that:
     - Is not eliminated (available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
     - Forms a valid English word.

3. **Identify the Word:**
   - The partially known word is ""M I _ S T"".
   - Common English words fitting this pattern:
     - ""MIDST"" is valid and likely (meaning ""middle of"" or a poetic term for center).
     - Other possibilities like ""MISTS"" (has duplicate S, but position 4 is S and it might conflict) or ""MINTS"" (has N, eliminated) are invalid due to eliminated letters or feedback. ""MIKST"", ""MIHST"", etc., are not words.
   - Since ""MIDST"" uses available letters (D is untested and not eliminated) and aligns with all constraints, it is the most probable guess.

4. **Next Guess Purpose:**
   - Guessing ""MIDST"" tests the only unknown position (D in position 3). If correct, it solves the puzzle based on current information.",Guess 4: MIDST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) I(✓) D(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
