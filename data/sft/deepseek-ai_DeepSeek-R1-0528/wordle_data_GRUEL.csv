We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are starting with the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is somewhere else, not at the end).
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter R in the second position (so _ R _ _ _).
 - The secret word contains E, but not at the last position (since we guessed E at the end and got ""-"" meaning it's present but not there).
 - We must avoid C, A, N in subsequent guesses.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Has R in the second position.
 - Contains E (but not at the fifth position).
 - Excludes C, A, N.

 Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

 Since R is fixed at position 2, we are looking for words that have: _ R ? ? ?

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So E could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's think of words that fit:
 Format: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

 Constraints:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5: cannot be C, A, N.
 - The word must contain E in either position 1, 3, or 4.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Common letters besides E that we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

 Possible words:
 Consider having E in position 1: E R _ _ _
 Then the word must not end with E (so position 5 is not E) and we avoid C,A,N.

 Examples: 
 - ""ERUPT"" (but U and P and T are new) -> let's check if valid? Yes, erupt is a word.
 - ""ERECT"" -> but we know C is not in the word, so no.
 - ""ERODE"" -> ends with E, but our feedback says E is not at the end? Actually, we guessed E at the end and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word has E but not at position 5. Therefore, if we try ERODE, the last letter is E, which would be incorrect because we know E is not at position 5? But note: in ERODE, E is at position 1 and 5. We know E is in the word, but the fifth position might be E? Wait no: our feedback for ""crane"" had E in position 5 and it got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at the end. So ERODE would be invalid because it has E at position 5? Actually, we can use it? But note: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5, but our guess can have E anywhere? Our guess can have E at position 5 again? But we know it's not there, so that's a wasted spot? We want to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, we should put E in a position we haven't tested: position 1, 3, or 4.

 Option: put E at position 1.

 Words starting with ER: 
 - ERASE: has A (forbidden) -> no.
 - ERGOT: G and O and T -> valid? Yes.
 - ERUPT: U, P, T -> valid.

 Another option: put E at position 3: _ R E _ _
 Words: 
 - FREED: ends with D? But also has two E's? And F, D. -> We haven't tested F or D. However, note FREED has E at position 3 and 4? Our feedback didn't say how many E's? The feedback for the first guess showed only one E (we got one '-' for E). But we don't know if there are more E's? The feedback doesn't indicate multiplicity. We only know that E is present at least once and not at position 5. It could be that there are two E's? So we aren't sure.

 Similarly, we could put E at position 4: _ R _ E _

 Since we are constrained to avoid C, A, N, and we are in the second guess, let's try to pick a word with completely new letters.

 We already have R at position 2 and E somewhere. So we want to test other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern without using C,A,N and with E not at the end.

 Example: ""TRIBE"" 
 - T R I B E -> but E is at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we guess TRIBE, then E is in position 5, which we know is not correct? So we would get '-' for E again? That would not give new information about E? Because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end again? Because that spot is ruled out.

 Therefore, let's avoid E at the end.

 Possible word: ""TRADE"" -> but A is forbidden? (we had A in crane and it was absent) ... so no A.

 Another: ""PRIDE"" -> P R I D E: E is at the end? So same problem.

 We need a word with E not at the end? How about ""PUREE""? Has E at the end? And we know E isn't at the end? Also, puree has two E's? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? We don't know, because the secret word might have two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the number. So it's possible? However, we are going to put E at the end again? That would be wasting a position? Because we already know E isn't there.

 So ideally, we should put E in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.

 Let me list some words with R in the second position and E in position 1,3, or 4 without C,A,N.

 Position 1: ER...
 - ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R (known), G, O, T -> all new except E and R? R we already know is in position 2, but we are testing G,O,T.
 - ERUPT: E R U P T -> letters: E, R, U, P, T -> also new.

 Position 3: ...RE...
 - BREED: but B and E? Note B R E E D -> but E is at position 3 and 4? The word has two E's? And B and D. But we can use B and D? However, we haven't tested B? Yes, we can test B and D.

 But note: we haven't tested B? So that's good? But also, we might get information about multiple E's? However, the secret word might have exactly the same letters? We don't know.

 Another: ""TREES"" -> has E at position 3 and 5? We don't want E at position 5? And we know E isn't at position 5? So guessing ""TREES"" would have E at 5? We shouldn't? But if we avoid the known bad position? However, we are guessing to get more information.

 Alternatively, position 4: ...R..E.
 - Example: ""GRIME"" -> G R I M E -> E at the end? Again, position 5? Avoid.

 Actually, ""URINE"": U R I N E -> but wait, N was in crane and marked absent? So no N? We avoid N.

 Correction: N is forbidden? So we cannot have words with N? We had ""crane"" and N was absent? So no N.

 How about ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> has E at the end? Avoid.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but has C? Forbidden? No C.

 ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> has E at the end? Avoid.

 It seems hard? Let me try words with E in position 3: 
 Pattern: _ R E _ _
 Without C,A,N and without E at the end? The last letter must not be E? So the pattern is * R E * * (with last not E)

 Words: 
 - TREK: T R E K -> only 4 letters? Wait, 5? TREK is 4 letters? No, TREK is 4.

 5-letter words: 
 - BREED: we said? but ends with D? Which is fine? But BREED -> has E in position 3 and 4? So if the secret word has only one E, then we might get information? But let's see: we know that E is present? So any E in the guess will get a ✓ or - if present? But there are two E's? So if secret has one E, then only one E will be marked? But the feedback marks every letter independently? Actually, the rules: 
   - ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position"" -> ✓
   - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" -> -

   So if the secret word has one E and it is in position 3, and we guess BREED:
     - Position 3: E -> ✓ (because correct position)
     - Position 4: E -> but the secret doesn't have a second E, so it would be marked x? 

   However, note that the secret word might have two E's? So we don't know.

 Let's look for words without repeating E? And with E in position 1,3, or 4.

 How about E in position 1? 
 Words: E R _ _ _ without C,A,N and without E at the end? So the last letter is not E? And the word must have no C,A,N.

 ERGOT, ERUPT, and also:
 - ERROR? But R is already at position 2? And the word has two R's? But we don't know if there are two R's? Also, O is new? But also, if the secret has two R's? Our feedback had only one R marked? We cannot assume only one R? Feedback marks per letter: for crane we guessed one R and got ✓, meaning there is an R at that position? It doesn't say anything about other R's? So secret could have more? Therefore, we can try words with multiple same letters? But we are not restricted.

 However, ERROR has two R's? And we know R is at position 2? So the first R is at position 2? The remaining letters: E, R, O, R? But positions: E R R O R? No, ERROR is E R R O R? Actually, ERROR is 5 letters? E-R-R-O-R? That's not standard? No, ERROR: E-R-R-O-R? That's 5 letters? Actually: E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5? But the word ERROR is spelled E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5 letters? But in English, ERROR is typically considered 5 letters: E, R, R, O, R -> wait, no: E, R, R, O, R? That's 5? But then position 3 and 5 are R? We know E is present? And we have R at position 2? The extra R's? We don't know.

 But importantly, we are forbidden to use A, C, N? ERROR has E,R,O? So okay? But we have already used R? Actually, we are forced to have R at position 2? So ERROR: E at pos1, R at 2, R at 3? Then O at 4 and R at 5? Now, the feedback for the first guess indicated E is present? But we don't know if it's at position 1? Or elsewhere? 

 Moreover, using ERROR might not be ideal because it repeats R and we may not get more information about other letters? 

 So let's try a word with new letters? 

 ERGOT: E R G O T -> tests G, O, T?
 ERUPT: E R U P T -> tests U, P, T?

 Both are good? 

 Alternatively, we might try to use a word that has multiple vowels? But we already have E?

 After consideration, I think ERUPT is a good candidate:
 - E at position 1: tests if E is at the start? 
 - R at position 2: already known, so will be a ✓.
 - U, P, T: new letters.

 So we'll get feedback on E at position 1 and U, P, T.

 If E is in the word at position 1, then we get a ✓? If E is elsewhere? Then we get a '-'? If E is not at position 1? Then we get '-' only if E is present? But we know E is present? So if we guess E at position 1 and it is the correct spot? Then ✓? Otherwise? If it is not at position 1? But present? Then we get '-'. So we can narrow down E's position.

 Similarly, the other letters U, P, T: we'll find out if they are in the word or not.

 So I choose ""ERUPT"".

### Thought Process

- **Previous Feedback for ""CRANE""**: 
  - C: not in word (x)
  - R: in word and correct position (✓) — so the secret word has R as the second letter.
  - A: not in word (x)
  - N: not in word (x)
  - E: in word but wrong position (-) — so E is in the secret word but not at the end (position 5).

- **Inferences**:
  - The secret word has the format: _ R _ _ _
  - The word contains E, but not in position 5 (so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
  - Letters not in the word: C, A, N — avoid these in future guesses.

- **Strategy for Second Guess**:
  - Keep R fixed in position 2.
  - Include E, but place it in a new position to test (position 1, 3, or 4 — not 5).
  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., consonants like T, P, G, or vowels like U, O) to gather fresh information.
  - Avoid reused/ineffective positions for E (position 5 is ruled out).

- **Potential Words**:
  - ""ERUPT"": E (position 1, tests if E is at start), R (✓, known), U, P, T (new letters). Efficient for info gain.
  - Alternatives considered: ""ERGOT"" (E at 1), ""BREED"" (E at 3/4), or ""TRIPE"" (E at 4). ""ERUPT"" chosen for:
    - All letters are new except R and E (maximizes information per guess).
    - Tests E in position 1 (unexplored).

**Next Guess**: ""ERUPT""    
- Expected feedback will clarify E’s position and the presence of U, P, T.

     - Position 4: E -> but the secret doesn't have a second E, so it would be marked x? 

   However, note that the secret word might have two E's? So we don't know.

 Let's look for words without repeating E? And with E in position 1,3, or 4.

 How about E in position 1? 
 Words: E R _ _ _ without C,A,N and without E at the end? So the last letter is not E? And the word must have no C,A,N.

 ERGOT, ERUPT, and also:
 - ERROR? But R is already at position 2? And the word has two R's? But we don't know if there are two R's? Also, O is new? But also, if the secret has two R's? Our feedback had only one R marked? We cannot assume only one R? Feedback marks per letter: for crane we guessed one R and got ✓, meaning there is an R at that position? It doesn't say anything about other R's? So secret could have more? Therefore, we can try words with multiple same letters? But we are not restricted.

 However, ERROR has two R's? And we know R is at position 2? So the first R is at position 2? The remaining letters: E, R, O, R? But positions: E R R O R? No, ERROR is E R R O R? Actually, ERROR is 5 letters? E-R-R-O-R? That's not standard? No, ERROR: E-R-R-O-R? That's 5 letters? Actually: E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5? But the word ERROR is spelled E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5 letters? But in English, ERROR is typically considered 5 letters: E, R, R, O, R -> wait, no: E, R, R, O, R? That's 5? But then position 3 and 5 are R? We know E is present? And we have R at position 2? The extra R's? We don't know.

 But importantly, we are forbidden to use A, C, N? ERROR has E,R,O? So okay? But we have already used R? Actually, we are forced to have R at position 2? So ERROR: E at pos1, R at 2, R at 3? Then O at 4 and R at 5? Now, the feedback for the first guess indicated E is present? But we don't know if it's at position 1? Or elsewhere? 

 Moreover, using ERROR might not be ideal because it repeats R and we may not get more information about other letters? 

 So let's try a word with new letters? 

 ERGOT: E R G O T -> tests G, O, T?
 ERUPT: E R U P T -> tests U, P, T?

 Both are good? 

 Alternatively, we might try to use a word that has multiple vowels? But we already have E?

 After consideration, I think ERUPT is a good candidate:
 - E at position 1: tests if E is at the start? 
 - R at position 2: already known, so will be a ✓.
 - U, P, T: new letters.

 So we'll get feedback on E at position 1 and U, P, T.

 If E is in the word at position 1, then we get a ✓? If E is elsewhere? Then we get a '-'? If E is not at position 1? Then we get '-' only if E is present? But we know E is present? So if we guess E at position 1 and it is the correct spot? Then ✓? Otherwise? If it is not at position 1? But present? Then we get '-'. So we can narrow down E's position.

 Similarly, the other letters U, P, T: we'll find out if they are in the word or not.

 So I choose ""ERUPT"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,GRUEL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting with the feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is somewhere else, not at the end).
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter R in the second position (so _ R _ _ _).
 - The secret word contains E, but not at the last position (since we guessed E at the end and got ""-"" meaning it's present but not there).
 - We must avoid C, A, N in subsequent guesses.

 Now, we need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Has R in the second position.
 - Contains E (but not at the fifth position).
 - Excludes C, A, N.

 Also, we can try to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

 Since R is fixed at position 2, we are looking for words that have: _ R ? ? ?

 We know the word has an E, but not at the end. So E could be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

 Let's think of words that fit:
 Format: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

 Constraints:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5: cannot be C, A, N.
 - The word must contain E in either position 1, 3, or 4.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Common letters besides E that we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, etc.

 Possible words:
 Consider having E in position 1: E R _ _ _
 Then the word must not end with E (so position 5 is not E) and we avoid C,A,N.

 Examples: 
 - ""ERUPT"" (but U and P and T are new) -> let's check if valid? Yes, erupt is a word.
 - ""ERECT"" -> but we know C is not in the word, so no.
 - ""ERODE"" -> ends with E, but our feedback says E is not at the end? Actually, we guessed E at the end and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at the end. So the secret word has E but not at position 5. Therefore, if we try ERODE, the last letter is E, which would be incorrect because we know E is not at position 5? But note: in ERODE, E is at position 1 and 5. We know E is in the word, but the fifth position might be E? Wait no: our feedback for ""crane"" had E in position 5 and it got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at the end. So ERODE would be invalid because it has E at position 5? Actually, we can use it? But note: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5, but our guess can have E anywhere? Our guess can have E at position 5 again? But we know it's not there, so that's a wasted spot? We want to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word but not at position 5, we should put E in a position we haven't tested: position 1, 3, or 4.

 Option: put E at position 1.

 Words starting with ER: 
 - ERASE: has A (forbidden) -> no.
 - ERGOT: G and O and T -> valid? Yes.
 - ERUPT: U, P, T -> valid.

 Another option: put E at position 3: _ R E _ _
 Words: 
 - FREED: ends with D? But also has two E's? And F, D. -> We haven't tested F or D. However, note FREED has E at position 3 and 4? Our feedback didn't say how many E's? The feedback for the first guess showed only one E (we got one '-' for E). But we don't know if there are more E's? The feedback doesn't indicate multiplicity. We only know that E is present at least once and not at position 5. It could be that there are two E's? So we aren't sure.

 Similarly, we could put E at position 4: _ R _ E _

 Since we are constrained to avoid C, A, N, and we are in the second guess, let's try to pick a word with completely new letters.

 We already have R at position 2 and E somewhere. So we want to test other common consonants and vowels.

 Let me think of words that fit the pattern without using C,A,N and with E not at the end.

 Example: ""TRIBE"" 
 - T R I B E -> but E is at the end? We know E is not at the end? So if we guess TRIBE, then E is in position 5, which we know is not correct? So we would get '-' for E again? That would not give new information about E? Because we already know E is not at the end. So we should avoid putting E at the end again? Because that spot is ruled out.

 Therefore, let's avoid E at the end.

 Possible word: ""TRADE"" -> but A is forbidden? (we had A in crane and it was absent) ... so no A.

 Another: ""PRIDE"" -> P R I D E: E is at the end? So same problem.

 We need a word with E not at the end? How about ""PUREE""? Has E at the end? And we know E isn't at the end? Also, puree has two E's? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? We don't know, because the secret word might have two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the number. So it's possible? However, we are going to put E at the end again? That would be wasting a position? Because we already know E isn't there.

 So ideally, we should put E in a different position: either 1, 3, or 4.

 Let me list some words with R in the second position and E in position 1,3, or 4 without C,A,N.

 Position 1: ER...
 - ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R (known), G, O, T -> all new except E and R? R we already know is in position 2, but we are testing G,O,T.
 - ERUPT: E R U P T -> letters: E, R, U, P, T -> also new.

 Position 3: ...RE...
 - BREED: but B and E? Note B R E E D -> but E is at position 3 and 4? The word has two E's? And B and D. But we can use B and D? However, we haven't tested B? Yes, we can test B and D.

 But note: we haven't tested B? So that's good? But also, we might get information about multiple E's? However, the secret word might have exactly the same letters? We don't know.

 Another: ""TREES"" -> has E at position 3 and 5? We don't want E at position 5? And we know E isn't at position 5? So guessing ""TREES"" would have E at 5? We shouldn't? But if we avoid the known bad position? However, we are guessing to get more information.

 Alternatively, position 4: ...R..E.
 - Example: ""GRIME"" -> G R I M E -> E at the end? Again, position 5? Avoid.

 Actually, ""URINE"": U R I N E -> but wait, N was in crane and marked absent? So no N? We avoid N.

 Correction: N is forbidden? So we cannot have words with N? We had ""crane"" and N was absent? So no N.

 How about ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> has E at the end? Avoid.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but has C? Forbidden? No C.

 ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> has E at the end? Avoid.

 It seems hard? Let me try words with E in position 3: 
 Pattern: _ R E _ _
 Without C,A,N and without E at the end? The last letter must not be E? So the pattern is * R E * * (with last not E)

 Words: 
 - TREK: T R E K -> only 4 letters? Wait, 5? TREK is 4 letters? No, TREK is 4.

 5-letter words: 
 - BREED: we said? but ends with D? Which is fine? But BREED -> has E in position 3 and 4? So if the secret word has only one E, then we might get information? But let's see: we know that E is present? So any E in the guess will get a ✓ or - if present? But there are two E's? So if secret has one E, then only one E will be marked? But the feedback marks every letter independently? Actually, the rules: 
   - ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position"" -> ✓
   - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" -> -

   So if the secret word has one E and it is in position 3, and we guess BREED:
     - Position 3: E -> ✓ (because correct position)
     - Position 4: E -> but the secret doesn't have a second E, so it would be marked x? 

   However, note that the secret word might have two E's? So we don't know.

 Let's look for words without repeating E? And with E in position 1,3, or 4.

 How about E in position 1? 
 Words: E R _ _ _ without C,A,N and without E at the end? So the last letter is not E? And the word must have no C,A,N.

 ERGOT, ERUPT, and also:
 - ERROR? But R is already at position 2? And the word has two R's? But we don't know if there are two R's? Also, O is new? But also, if the secret has two R's? Our feedback had only one R marked? We cannot assume only one R? Feedback marks per letter: for crane we guessed one R and got ✓, meaning there is an R at that position? It doesn't say anything about other R's? So secret could have more? Therefore, we can try words with multiple same letters? But we are not restricted.

 However, ERROR has two R's? And we know R is at position 2? So the first R is at position 2? The remaining letters: E, R, O, R? But positions: E R R O R? No, ERROR is E R R O R? Actually, ERROR is 5 letters? E-R-R-O-R? That's not standard? No, ERROR: E-R-R-O-R? That's 5 letters? Actually: E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5? But the word ERROR is spelled E-R-R-O-R? But that's 5 letters? But in English, ERROR is typically considered 5 letters: E, R, R, O, R -> wait, no: E, R, R, O, R? That's 5? But then position 3 and 5 are R? We know E is present? And we have R at position 2? The extra R's? We don't know.

 But importantly, we are forbidden to use A, C, N? ERROR has E,R,O? So okay? But we have already used R? Actually, we are forced to have R at position 2? So ERROR: E at pos1, R at 2, R at 3? Then O at 4 and R at 5? Now, the feedback for the first guess indicated E is present? But we don't know if it's at position 1? Or elsewhere? 

 Moreover, using ERROR might not be ideal because it repeats R and we may not get more information about other letters? 

 So let's try a word with new letters? 

 ERGOT: E R G O T -> tests G, O, T?
 ERUPT: E R U P T -> tests U, P, T?

 Both are good? 

 Alternatively, we might try to use a word that has multiple vowels? But we already have E?

 After consideration, I think ERUPT is a good candidate:
 - E at position 1: tests if E is at the start? 
 - R at position 2: already known, so will be a ✓.
 - U, P, T: new letters.

 So we'll get feedback on E at position 1 and U, P, T.

 If E is in the word at position 1, then we get a ✓? If E is elsewhere? Then we get a '-'? If E is not at position 1? Then we get '-' only if E is present? But we know E is present? So if we guess E at position 1 and it is the correct spot? Then ✓? Otherwise? If it is not at position 1? But present? Then we get '-'. So we can narrow down E's position.

 Similarly, the other letters U, P, T: we'll find out if they are in the word or not.

 So I choose ""ERUPT"".

Yes, we can test B and D.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested B? So that\'s good? But also, we might get information about multiple E\'s? However, the secret word might have exactly the same letters? We don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""TREES"" -> has E at position 3 and 5? We don\'t want E at position 5? And we know E isn\'t at position 5? So guessing ""TREES"" would have E at 5? We shouldn\'t? But if we avoid the known bad position? However, we are guessing to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, position 4: ...R..E.\n - Example: ""GRIME"" -> G R I M E -> E at the end? Again, position 5? Avoid.\n\n Actually, ""URINE"": U R I N E -> but wait, N was in crane and marked absent? So no N? We avoid N.\n\n Correction: N is forbidden? So we cannot have words with N? We had ""crane"" and N was absent? So no N.\n\n How about ""BRIDE"": B R I D E -> has E at the end? Avoid.\n\n Another: ""PRICE"" -> but has C? Forbidden? No C.\n\n ""FRISE"": F R I S E -> has E at the end? Avoid.\n\n It seems hard? Let me try words with E in position 3: \n Pattern: _ R E _ _\n Without C,A,N and without E at the end? The last letter must not be E? So the pattern is * R E * * (with last not E)\n\n Words: \n - TREK: T R E K -> only 4 letters? Wait, 5? TREK is 4 letters? No, TREK is 4.\n\n 5-letter words: \n - BREED: we said? but ends with D? Which is fine? But BREED -> has E in position 3 and 4? So if the secret word has only one E, then we might get information? But let\'s see: we know that E is present? So any E in the guess will get a ✓ or - if present? But there are two E\'s? So if secret has one E, then only one E will be marked? But the feedback marks every letter independently? Actually, the rules: \n   - ""The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position"" -> ✓\n   - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" -> -\n\n   So if the secret word has one E and it is in position 3, and we guess BREED:\n     - Position 3: E -> ✓ (because correct position)\n     - Position 4: E -> but the secret doesn\'t have a second E, so it would be marked x? \n\n   However, note that the secret word might have two E\'s? So we don\'t know.\n\n Let\'s look for words without repeating E? And with E in position 1,3, or 4.\n\n How about E in position 1? \n Words: E R _ _ _ without C,A,N and without E at the end? So the last letter is not E? And the word must have no C,A,N.\n\n ERGOT, ERUPT, and also:\n - ERROR? But R is already at position 2? And the word has two R\'s? But we don\'t know if there are two R\'s? Also, O is new? But also, if the secret has two R\'s? Our feedback had only one R marked? We cannot assume only one R? Feedback marks per letter: for crane we guessed one R and got ✓, meaning there is an R at that position? It doesn\'t say anything about other R\'s? So secret could have more? Therefore, we can try words with multiple same letters? But we are not restricted.\n\n However, ERROR has two R\'s? And we know R is at position 2? So the first R is at position 2? The remaining letters: E, R, O, R? But positions: E R R O R? No, ERROR is E R R O R? Actually, ERROR is 5 letters? E-R-R-O-R? That\'s not standard? No, ERROR: E-R-R-O-R? That\'s 5 letters? Actually: E-R-R-O-R? But that\'s 5? But the word ERROR is spelled E-R-R-O-R? But that\'s 5 letters? But in English, ERROR is typically considered 5 letters: E, R, R, O, R -> wait, no: E, R, R, O, R? That\'s 5? But then position 3 and 5 are R? We know E is present? And we have R at position 2? The extra R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n But importantly, we are forbidden to use A, C, N? ERROR has E,R,O? So okay? But we have already used R? Actually, we are forced to have R at position 2? So ERROR: E at pos1, R at 2, R at 3? Then O at 4 and R at 5? Now, the feedback for the first guess indicated E is present? But we don\'t know if it\'s at position 1? Or elsewhere? \n\n Moreover, using ERROR might not be ideal because it repeats R and we may not get more information about other letters? \n\n So let\'s try a word with new letters? \n\n ERGOT: E R G O T -> tests G, O, T?\n ERUPT: E R U P T -> tests U, P, T?\n\n Both are good? \n\n Alternatively, we might try to use a word that has multiple vowels? But we already have E?\n\n After consideration, I think ERUPT is a good candidate:\n - E at position 1: tests if E is at the start? \n - R at position 2: already known, so will be a ✓.\n - U, P, T: new letters.\n\n So we\'ll get feedback on E at position 1 and U, P, T.\n\n If E is in the word at position 1, then we get a ✓? If E is elsewhere? Then we get a \'-\'? If E is not at position 1? Then we get \'-\' only if E is present? But we know E is present? So if we guess E at position 1 and it is the correct spot? Then ✓? Otherwise? If it is not at position 1? But present? Then we get \'-\'. So we can narrow down E\'s position.\n\n Similarly, the other letters U, P, T: we\'ll find out if they are in the word or not.\n\n So I choose ""ERUPT"".\n\n<guess>erupt</guess>### Thought Process\n\n- **Previous Feedback for ""CRANE""**: \n  - C: not in word (x)\n  - R: in word and correct position (✓) — so the secret word has R as the second letter.\n  - A: not in word (x)\n  - N: not in word (x)\n  - E: in word but wrong position (-) — so E is in the secret word but not at the end (position 5).\n\n- **Inferences**:\n  - The secret word has the format: _ R _ _ _\n  - The word contains E, but not in position 5 (so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4).\n  - Letters not in the word: C, A, N — avoid these in future guesses.\n\n- **Strategy for Second Guess**:\n  - Keep R fixed in position 2.\n  - Include E, but place it in a new position to test (position 1, 3, or 4 — not 5).\n  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., consonants like T, P, G, or vowels like U, O) to gather fresh information.\n  - Avoid reused/ineffective positions for E (position 5 is ruled out).\n\n- **Potential Words**:\n  - ""ERUPT"": E (position 1, tests if E is at start), R (✓, known), U, P, T (new letters).

First, I need to analyze the feedback from both guesses to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

**Feedback Recap:**
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)**
  - C, A, N are NOT in the word.
  - R is in the word and in the CORRECT position (2nd letter).
  - E is in the word but in the WRONG position (it's not at the end, position 5).

- **Guess 2: ""erupt"" → Feedback: E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(x)**
  - E is in the word but in the WRONG position (since we placed E at position 1, but it's not there).
  - R is in the CORRECT position (2nd letter, confirmed again).
  - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (3rd letter? Let's see: ""erupt"" positions: 1-E, 2-R, 3-U, 4-P, 5-T; U is position 3).
  - P and T are NOT in the word.

From this, key points are:
- R is definitely the 2nd letter: so the secret word is _ R _ _ _
- U is definitely the 3rd letter and in the correct position: so now we have _ R U _ _
- E is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got - for E at position 1), and we already know it's not at position 5 from the first guess. So E must be in position 4? Let's confirm positions:
  - In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and got (-), meaning wrong position.
  - In ""erupt"", E was at position 1 and got (-), meaning wrong position.
  - Therefore, E can only be in position 4 for a 5-letter word? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R, and position 3 is U, both confirmed, so E can't be there. Position 1 and 5 are ruled out for E, so E must be at position 4? But in the secret word, position 4 is still unknown.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""erupt"" feedback.
- Position 2: is R, so no.
- Position 3: is U, so no.
- Position 4: possible? We haven't tested it directly.
- Position 5: ruled out by ""crane"" feedback.

So E must be at position 4? Because it's the only position left. But is that right? The feedback doesn't say how many times E is in the word; it could be in multiple positions, but we only know it's present and not at 1 or 5, and since 2 and 3 are occupied by R and U, it has to be at position 4? Yes, that seems logical.

- Also, we know E is not at position 5 from guess 1, not at position 1 from guess 2, and positions 2-3 are fixed as R and U, so E must be at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has: position 4 = E? So pattern: _ R U E _

But let's confirm: positions are:
- 1: unknown
- 2: R
- 3: U
- 4: ? (but E must be here)
- 5: ?

We have letters that are excluded:
- From ""crane"": C, A, N are out.
- From ""erupt"": P and T are out.
- So excluded letters: C, A, N, P, T.

In ""crane"", all letters were tested: C, R, A, N, E – and only R and E are in the word (E misplaced).
In ""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T – only E, R, U are in (E misplaced, P and T out).

So confirmed in word: R, U, E (and R and U in specific positions, E not in pos 1 or 5, so must be pos 4?).

Since U is confirmed at position 3, and E must be somewhere else because it's not at 1 or 5, and position 4 is the only slot left? Position 1 and 5 are open, but E can't be there based on feedback. Positions:
- Pos 1: we know E isn't there because of ""erupt"" feedback.
- Pos 2: R, not E.
- Pos 3: U, not E.
- Pos 4: not tested directly.
- Pos 5: we know E isn't there from ""crane"".

Therefore, E must be at position 4? Because all other positions are occupied or ruled out.

Also, in ""erupt"", we have U at position 3 with a ✓, which confirms U is correct and in place.

So secret word is: _ R U E _

Now, we need a word that fits: ? R U E ?

Last character is unknown, and first character is unknown.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, T (from both guesses).

Letters in the word: we know R, U, E are in, and now possibly others.

We have no information on the first and last letters yet, except that they can't be E or the excluded letters.

Possible letters: from alphabet, excluding known bad: C, A, N, P, T.

So available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. – but must form a valid English word.

Now, pattern: ? R U E ?

So we need a 5-letter word ending with ? and starting with ?, where the ? are not C,A,N,P,T and not conflicting.

What words fit this pattern?

Examples:
- BRUTE? But T is excluded, so BRUTE has T at end? T is out? Guess 2: erupt → T(x), so T not in word? BRUTE ends with T, which is bad.
- GRUES? Grue is not a word, grues might be a word? But let's check common words.
- TRUED? But T is out? And D at end? Not sure if word.
- CRUEL? But C is excluded? From guess1, C(x), so C not in word? CRUEL starts with C, bad.
- FRUED? Not a word.
- DRUES? Not common.

Common words: BRUISE? But that's 6 letters? No, BRUISE is 6? B-R-U-I-S-E, 6 letters? Wait, BRUISE is 6, too long.

Shorter words: how about ARUES? But A is out? From guess1, A(x).

Another: GRUEL? G-R-U-E-L – that's 5 letters. Positions: G (first), R (2nd), U (3rd), E (4th), L (5th). So it fits _ R U E L? Last letter L.

Is GRUEL a word? Yes, meaning a thin porridge.

Does it avoid excluded letters? G, L not excluded? Excluded are C,A,N,P,T. G and L are fine? So GRUEL should be possible.

Another possibility: SHRUB? But that's S-H-R-U-B? Positions: S at 1, H at 2? But we need position 2 is R? Must be _ R U E _, so H-R-U-E B? No, SHRUB is S-H-R-U-B, which has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R. So incompatible.

The pattern must have R at position 2 and U at position 3, so first character must be such that the word starts with ? R U, then E, then ?.

So ? R U E ?

Examples: 
- CRUDE? But C is excluded? D at end, T not involved? Wait, CRUDE has C, which is bad since C is out.
- PRUDE? P is excluded? From guess2, P(x), and it has P.
- TRUCE? T and C excluded? Bad.
- TRUE? Only 4 letters? Not enough.

Other words: BRUME? B-R-U-M-E? But E is at end? Secret word should have E at position 4? In BRUME, positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But we think E should be at position 4? In this case, E is at position 5, but we know E can't be at position 5 from first guess? So BRUME can't be, because position 5 is E?

In GRUEL, position 5 is L, E at position 4.

Similarly, another word: FRUES? Not a word.

Also, DRUSE? D-R-U-S-E? That could be: D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But E at position 5? Again, feedback from ""crane"" showed E not at position 5? So position 5 can't be E in secret word? Therefore, words ending with E are invalid? Only if E is at position 4?

So for DRUSE: if E is at position 5, it can't be secret word.

Similarly, GRUEL has E at position 4? G-R-U-E-L: position 1-G, 2-R, 3-U, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, E at position 4, good. Position 5 is L.

Similarly, BRUME: B-R-U-M-E, position 4-M, 5-E, but E at position 5, which is forbidden? So not possible.

How about other words?
- SHRUG? S-H-R-U-G? But H at position 2? Need position 2 R? No, it's H at 2? Must be exactly position 2 R.
- No, pattern is fixed: _ R U ? ?

But E must be at position 4? So yes, _ R U E ?

So possible words:
- GRUEL: G R U E L
- Maybe DRUEL? D R U E L? But DRUEL is a word, meaning cruelty? Positions: D(1), R(2), U(3), E(4), L(5)? Same as GRUEL but D instead of G? And L at end.

GRUEL and DRUEL both fit? Are there others?

- SCRUB? Too long? S-C-R-U-B? 5 letters, but C is excluded? And S at 1, C at 2? No, position 2 must be R? SCRUB: positions 1-S, 2-C, but C is not R? So not.

Only words with pattern ? R U E ?

Common ones: BRULE? But that might be French? Not common English? Brule means burned, but often not used as word.

PRUES? Not word.

URENA? U at start? U-R-E-N-A? Positions: U(1), R(2), E(3)? But E at 3, but in secret, U is at position 3? Conflict? If first letter is U, but U is at position 3? No, positions must match? Secret word position 3 is U already? But if we guess a word starting with U, position 1 would be U, but U might not be at position 1? We don't know yet.

From feedback, U is only confirmed to be at position 3? Not necessarily elsewhere? But in the secret word, U might appear only once or multiple times? We don't know.

But in terms of the pattern, since position 3 is fixed as U, and position 2 as R, we have ? R U E ?

So for example, if we have a word like U R U E ? but that might not exist? Or DOUBLE-U? Not.

Standard words: CRUET? C-R-U-E-T? But C and T excluded? C at start, T at end? Bad.

GRUESOME? Too long.

Short words: only GRUEL and DRUEL come to mind? Or maybe BRUEGEL? Too long.

Let's confirm English words:
- GRUEL: valid, meaning a thin porridge.
- DRUEL: not a standard word? I think it's ""cruel"" misspelled? Cruel is C-R-U-E-L, but C is excluded? Cruel starts with C.

Druel? No, I think DRUEL is not common; perhaps DREWEL? No.

Another: FRUITS? Not matching.

Perhaps I missed some.

GRUEF? Not word.

Or BRUIN? B-R-U-I-N? Positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5). But N is excluded? From guess1, N(x), so N not in word? So BRUIN has N, bad.

SPRUCE? Too long, S-P-R-U-C-E? P and C excluded.

Focus: pattern must be ? R U E ?

With E at position 4.

Possible:
- GRUEL: G R U E L (valid)
- ? Only GRUEL? But L at position 5.

What about SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? But positions: S(1), H(2), R(3)? Not matching; we need R at position 2? So S(1)H(2) has H at 2, should be R? Not.

SHRUB: S-H-R-U-B, again H at 2.

Must be exactly ? R U E ?

So another word: ARUHE? Not English.

Perhaps CRUMES? C at start excluded.

Not many words. Only GRUEL seems common? Or DRUEL? Let me check dictionary: DRUEL might be archaic or less common? In Wordle, words should be valid, but GRUEL is standard.

But GRUEL ends with L, which is allowed? Excluded letters don't include L.

Similarly, perhaps FUELS? But F-U-E-L-S? Positions: F(1), U(2)? But secret U at position 3? Conflict? FUELS has U at position 2, not 3? Not matching pattern.

RUGBY? R-U-G-B-Y? Position 1-R, but secret position 2 is R? So position 1 would be different? RUBGY not 5.

I think GRUEL is a strong candidate.

But let's not forget that E could be elsewhere? Earlier I concluded E must be at position 4, but let's double-check.

Is it possible E is in the word but at a position we haven't considered? Positions 1 to 5: 
- Position 1: E not here (from erupt)
- Position 2: R fixed
- Position 3: U fixed
- Position 4: open
- Position 5: E not here (from crane)

Position 4 is the only slot, so E must be at position 4? Yes.

Therefore, secret word is _ R U E _

First letter can be anything except excluded, and last letter anything except excluded.

For GRUEL: G at first, L at last? Both not excluded.

Another word: TRUE? but 4 letters.

BRUTE: but T at end? T excluded? Yes.

CRUDE: C excluded.

PRUNE: P excluded, and N excluded? Also E at end? PRUNE: P-R-U-N-E? Positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), E(5). But N is excluded (N(x) from crane), E at position 5? Both bad.

Not possible.

So GRUEL seems a good guess? Or similar.

But DRUEL? If it's a word? Or CRUEL, C excluded.

Maybe GRUED? Not word.

Another: FRUED? Not.

So I'll go with GRUEL.

But in GRUEL, last letter is L? And we haven't tested L? So it's a guess.

Perhaps we can test more letters.

Since we have two guesses left? We have used 2 guesses? Game has up to 6 guesses? So we can make educated guess.

Another possibility: we know from feedback that in ""erupt"", U at position 3 is ✓, but that doesn't necessarily mean U is only at position 3? But for the secret word, position 3 is U.

Now, for the first letter, it could be various.

In GRUEL, letters used: G, R, U, E, L. R and U were tested, E was already known? But G and L are new.

Similarly, if we guess GRUEL, feedback will tell us if G is correct at 1, L at 5, and confirm E at 4 (should be ✓ if our deduction is right).

But we don't have G and L in previous guesses? So we need to introduce new letters.

Is there a better guess that tests more possibilities?

For example, we might guess a word with L or other letters to see if it's included.

But since pattern is fixed except first and last, and E must be at 4? We should just guess ? R U E ?

Possible letters for first position: since we have few constraints, we could choose a word like SHREW? But SHREW doesn't match pattern? S-H-R-E-W, positions wrong.

No, we must stick to the pattern.

Perhaps BOWEL? But doesn't have U at position 3? Must have U at 3.

So options: GRUEL, or DRUEL if valid? Or BRULE, less common.

I think GRUEL is fine.

To maximize information, if we guess GRUEL and it's wrong, we still get feedback on G and L.

But since we have only _ R U E _, we can guess directly.

Moreover, GRUEL has E at position 4, which we think must be, so if E is not ✓ at position 4, then our deduction is wrong? But according to feedback, it should be.

So let's assume GRUEL is a good candidate and guess it.

Therefore, next guess: GRUEL
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
- **Feedback from ""crane""**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:
  - R is in the word and correctly positioned at slot 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked wrong there).
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - Secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _ (with E present but not at position 5).

- **Feedback from ""erupt""**: E(-), R(✓), U(✓), P(x), T(x). This means:
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (marked wrong there).
  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).
  - U is in the word and correctly positioned at slot 3.
  - P and T are not in the word.
  - Secret word pattern updates to: _ R U _ _ (since U is fixed at position 3).

- **Inferences**:
  1. **Position of E**: From both feedbacks:
     - E cannot be at position 1 (ruled out by ""erupt"" feedback).
     - E cannot be at position 5 (ruled out by ""crane"" feedback).
     - Positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and U, so E must be at position 4. Thus, the secret word pattern is: _ R U E _.
  2. **Excluded letters**: C, A, N (from ""crane""), and P, T (from ""erupt""). Letters B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z are still possible for position 1 and position 5.
  3. **Possible words**: The word must fit the pattern _ R U E _ and be a valid English word. Common options:
     - **GRUEL** (G at position 1, L at position 5): ""Gruel"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a thin liquid food.
     - **DRUEL** (D at position 1, L at position 5): Less common and may be archaic; ""gruel"" is more standard.
     - Other words like **BRUCE** or **TRUCE** include excluded letters (B or T) and are invalid. **CRUEL** starts with C (excluded).
  4. **Choice of guess**: 
     - **GRUEL** tests:
        - Position 1: G (unconfirmed letter).
        - Position 4: E (should be ✓ if inference is correct).
        - Position 5: L (unconfirmed letter).
     - It uses new letters (G and L) to maximize information for future guesses and avoids excluded letters. If incorrect, the feedback will clarify the first or last letter.

Given this, **GRUEL** is a logical and efficient next guess to test the pattern and confirm the position of E.

<guess>gruel</guess>",gruel,"First, I need to analyze the feedback from both guesses to narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

**Feedback Recap:**
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)**
  - C, A, N are NOT in the word.
  - R is in the word and in the CORRECT position (2nd letter).
  - E is in the word but in the WRONG position (it's not at the end, position 5).

- **Guess 2: ""erupt"" → Feedback: E(-) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) T(x)**
  - E is in the word but in the WRONG position (since we placed E at position 1, but it's not there).
  - R is in the CORRECT position (2nd letter, confirmed again).
  - U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (3rd letter? Let's see: ""erupt"" positions: 1-E, 2-R, 3-U, 4-P, 5-T; U is position 3).
  - P and T are NOT in the word.

From this, key points are:
- R is definitely the 2nd letter: so the secret word is _ R _ _ _
- U is definitely the 3rd letter and in the correct position: so now we have _ R U _ _
- E is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got - for E at position 1), and we already know it's not at position 5 from the first guess. So E must be in position 4? Let's confirm positions:
  - In ""crane"", E was at position 5 and got (-), meaning wrong position.
  - In ""erupt"", E was at position 1 and got (-), meaning wrong position.
  - Therefore, E can only be in position 4 for a 5-letter word? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R, and position 3 is U, both confirmed, so E can't be there. Position 1 and 5 are ruled out for E, so E must be at position 4? But in the secret word, position 4 is still unknown.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: ruled out by ""erupt"" feedback.
- Position 2: is R, so no.
- Position 3: is U, so no.
- Position 4: possible? We haven't tested it directly.
- Position 5: ruled out by ""crane"" feedback.

So E must be at position 4? Because it's the only position left. But is that right? The feedback doesn't say how many times E is in the word; it could be in multiple positions, but we only know it's present and not at 1 or 5, and since 2 and 3 are occupied by R and U, it has to be at position 4? Yes, that seems logical.

- Also, we know E is not at position 5 from guess 1, not at position 1 from guess 2, and positions 2-3 are fixed as R and U, so E must be at position 4.

Therefore, the secret word has: position 4 = E? So pattern: _ R U E _

But let's confirm: positions are:
- 1: unknown
- 2: R
- 3: U
- 4: ? (but E must be here)
- 5: ?

We have letters that are excluded:
- From ""crane"": C, A, N are out.
- From ""erupt"": P and T are out.
- So excluded letters: C, A, N, P, T.

In ""crane"", all letters were tested: C, R, A, N, E – and only R and E are in the word (E misplaced).
In ""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T – only E, R, U are in (E misplaced, P and T out).

So confirmed in word: R, U, E (and R and U in specific positions, E not in pos 1 or 5, so must be pos 4?).

Since U is confirmed at position 3, and E must be somewhere else because it's not at 1 or 5, and position 4 is the only slot left? Position 1 and 5 are open, but E can't be there based on feedback. Positions:
- Pos 1: we know E isn't there because of ""erupt"" feedback.
- Pos 2: R, not E.
- Pos 3: U, not E.
- Pos 4: not tested directly.
- Pos 5: we know E isn't there from ""crane"".

Therefore, E must be at position 4? Because all other positions are occupied or ruled out.

Also, in ""erupt"", we have U at position 3 with a ✓, which confirms U is correct and in place.

So secret word is: _ R U E _

Now, we need a word that fits: ? R U E ?

Last character is unknown, and first character is unknown.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, T (from both guesses).

Letters in the word: we know R, U, E are in, and now possibly others.

We have no information on the first and last letters yet, except that they can't be E or the excluded letters.

Possible letters: from alphabet, excluding known bad: C, A, N, P, T.

So available letters include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. – but must form a valid English word.

Now, pattern: ? R U E ?

So we need a 5-letter word ending with ? and starting with ?, where the ? are not C,A,N,P,T and not conflicting.

What words fit this pattern?

Examples:
- BRUTE? But T is excluded, so BRUTE has T at end? T is out? Guess 2: erupt → T(x), so T not in word? BRUTE ends with T, which is bad.
- GRUES? Grue is not a word, grues might be a word? But let's check common words.
- TRUED? But T is out? And D at end? Not sure if word.
- CRUEL? But C is excluded? From guess1, C(x), so C not in word? CRUEL starts with C, bad.
- FRUED? Not a word.
- DRUES? Not common.

Common words: BRUISE? But that's 6 letters? No, BRUISE is 6? B-R-U-I-S-E, 6 letters? Wait, BRUISE is 6, too long.

Shorter words: how about ARUES? But A is out? From guess1, A(x).

Another: GRUEL? G-R-U-E-L – that's 5 letters. Positions: G (first), R (2nd), U (3rd), E (4th), L (5th). So it fits _ R U E L? Last letter L.

Is GRUEL a word? Yes, meaning a thin porridge.

Does it avoid excluded letters? G, L not excluded? Excluded are C,A,N,P,T. G and L are fine? So GRUEL should be possible.

Another possibility: SHRUB? But that's S-H-R-U-B? Positions: S at 1, H at 2? But we need position 2 is R? Must be _ R U E _, so H-R-U-E B? No, SHRUB is S-H-R-U-B, which has H at position 2? But we need position 2 to be R. So incompatible.

The pattern must have R at position 2 and U at position 3, so first character must be such that the word starts with ? R U, then E, then ?.

So ? R U E ?

Examples: 
- CRUDE? But C is excluded? D at end, T not involved? Wait, CRUDE has C, which is bad since C is out.
- PRUDE? P is excluded? From guess2, P(x), and it has P.
- TRUCE? T and C excluded? Bad.
- TRUE? Only 4 letters? Not enough.

Other words: BRUME? B-R-U-M-E? But E is at end? Secret word should have E at position 4? In BRUME, positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). But we think E should be at position 4? In this case, E is at position 5, but we know E can't be at position 5 from first guess? So BRUME can't be, because position 5 is E?

In GRUEL, position 5 is L, E at position 4.

Similarly, another word: FRUES? Not a word.

Also, DRUSE? D-R-U-S-E? That could be: D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But E at position 5? Again, feedback from ""crane"" showed E not at position 5? So position 5 can't be E in secret word? Therefore, words ending with E are invalid? Only if E is at position 4?

So for DRUSE: if E is at position 5, it can't be secret word.

Similarly, GRUEL has E at position 4? G-R-U-E-L: position 1-G, 2-R, 3-U, 4-E, 5-L. Yes, E at position 4, good. Position 5 is L.

Similarly, BRUME: B-R-U-M-E, position 4-M, 5-E, but E at position 5, which is forbidden? So not possible.

How about other words?
- SHRUG? S-H-R-U-G? But H at position 2? Need position 2 R? No, it's H at 2? Must be exactly position 2 R.
- No, pattern is fixed: _ R U ? ?

But E must be at position 4? So yes, _ R U E ?

So possible words:
- GRUEL: G R U E L
- Maybe DRUEL? D R U E L? But DRUEL is a word, meaning cruelty? Positions: D(1), R(2), U(3), E(4), L(5)? Same as GRUEL but D instead of G? And L at end.

GRUEL and DRUEL both fit? Are there others?

- SCRUB? Too long? S-C-R-U-B? 5 letters, but C is excluded? And S at 1, C at 2? No, position 2 must be R? SCRUB: positions 1-S, 2-C, but C is not R? So not.

Only words with pattern ? R U E ?

Common ones: BRULE? But that might be French? Not common English? Brule means burned, but often not used as word.

PRUES? Not word.

URENA? U at start? U-R-E-N-A? Positions: U(1), R(2), E(3)? But E at 3, but in secret, U is at position 3? Conflict? If first letter is U, but U is at position 3? No, positions must match? Secret word position 3 is U already? But if we guess a word starting with U, position 1 would be U, but U might not be at position 1? We don't know yet.

From feedback, U is only confirmed to be at position 3? Not necessarily elsewhere? But in the secret word, U might appear only once or multiple times? We don't know.

But in terms of the pattern, since position 3 is fixed as U, and position 2 as R, we have ? R U E ?

So for example, if we have a word like U R U E ? but that might not exist? Or DOUBLE-U? Not.

Standard words: CRUET? C-R-U-E-T? But C and T excluded? C at start, T at end? Bad.

GRUESOME? Too long.

Short words: only GRUEL and DRUEL come to mind? Or maybe BRUEGEL? Too long.

Let's confirm English words:
- GRUEL: valid, meaning a thin porridge.
- DRUEL: not a standard word? I think it's ""cruel"" misspelled? Cruel is C-R-U-E-L, but C is excluded? Cruel starts with C.

Druel? No, I think DRUEL is not common; perhaps DREWEL? No.

Another: FRUITS? Not matching.

Perhaps I missed some.

GRUEF? Not word.

Or BRUIN? B-R-U-I-N? Positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), N(5). But N is excluded? From guess1, N(x), so N not in word? So BRUIN has N, bad.

SPRUCE? Too long, S-P-R-U-C-E? P and C excluded.

Focus: pattern must be ? R U E ?

With E at position 4.

Possible:
- GRUEL: G R U E L (valid)
- ? Only GRUEL? But L at position 5.

What about SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? But positions: S(1), H(2), R(3)? Not matching; we need R at position 2? So S(1)H(2) has H at 2, should be R? Not.

SHRUB: S-H-R-U-B, again H at 2.

Must be exactly ? R U E ?

So another word: ARUHE? Not English.

Perhaps CRUMES? C at start excluded.

Not many words. Only GRUEL seems common? Or DRUEL? Let me check dictionary: DRUEL might be archaic or less common? In Wordle, words should be valid, but GRUEL is standard.

But GRUEL ends with L, which is allowed? Excluded letters don't include L.

Similarly, perhaps FUELS? But F-U-E-L-S? Positions: F(1), U(2)? But secret U at position 3? Conflict? FUELS has U at position 2, not 3? Not matching pattern.

RUGBY? R-U-G-B-Y? Position 1-R, but secret position 2 is R? So position 1 would be different? RUBGY not 5.

I think GRUEL is a strong candidate.

But let's not forget that E could be elsewhere? Earlier I concluded E must be at position 4, but let's double-check.

Is it possible E is in the word but at a position we haven't considered? Positions 1 to 5: 
- Position 1: E not here (from erupt)
- Position 2: R fixed
- Position 3: U fixed
- Position 4: open
- Position 5: E not here (from crane)

Position 4 is the only slot, so E must be at position 4? Yes.

Therefore, secret word is _ R U E _

First letter can be anything except excluded, and last letter anything except excluded.

For GRUEL: G at first, L at last? Both not excluded.

Another word: TRUE? but 4 letters.

BRUTE: but T at end? T excluded? Yes.

CRUDE: C excluded.

PRUNE: P excluded, and N excluded? Also E at end? PRUNE: P-R-U-N-E? Positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), E(5). But N is excluded (N(x) from crane), E at position 5? Both bad.

Not possible.

So GRUEL seems a good guess? Or similar.

But DRUEL? If it's a word? Or CRUEL, C excluded.

Maybe GRUED? Not word.

Another: FRUED? Not.

So I'll go with GRUEL.

But in GRUEL, last letter is L? And we haven't tested L? So it's a guess.

Perhaps we can test more letters.

Since we have two guesses left? We have used 2 guesses? Game has up to 6 guesses? So we can make educated guess.

Another possibility: we know from feedback that in ""erupt"", U at position 3 is ✓, but that doesn't necessarily mean U is only at position 3? But for the secret word, position 3 is U.

Now, for the first letter, it could be various.

In GRUEL, letters used: G, R, U, E, L. R and U were tested, E was already known? But G and L are new.

Similarly, if we guess GRUEL, feedback will tell us if G is correct at 1, L at 5, and confirm E at 4 (should be ✓ if our deduction is right).

But we don't have G and L in previous guesses? So we need to introduce new letters.

Is there a better guess that tests more possibilities?

For example, we might guess a word with L or other letters to see if it's included.

But since pattern is fixed except first and last, and E must be at 4? We should just guess ? R U E ?

Possible letters for first position: since we have few constraints, we could choose a word like SHREW? But SHREW doesn't match pattern? S-H-R-E-W, positions wrong.

No, we must stick to the pattern.

Perhaps BOWEL? But doesn't have U at position 3? Must have U at 3.

So options: GRUEL, or DRUEL if valid? Or BRULE, less common.

I think GRUEL is fine.

To maximize information, if we guess GRUEL and it's wrong, we still get feedback on G and L.

But since we have only _ R U E _, we can guess directly.

Moreover, GRUEL has E at position 4, which we think must be, so if E is not ✓ at position 4, then our deduction is wrong? But according to feedback, it should be.

So let's assume GRUEL is a good candidate and guess it.

Therefore, next guess: GRUELBased on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning for the next guess:

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:
- **Feedback from ""crane""**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:
  - R is in the word and correctly positioned at slot 2.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked wrong there).
  - C, A, and N are not in the word.
  - Secret word pattern: _ R _ _ _ (with E present but not at position 5).

- **Feedback from ""erupt""**: E(-), R(✓), U(✓), P(x), T(x). This means:
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (marked wrong there).
  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).
  - U is in the word and correctly positioned at slot 3.
  - P and T are not in the word.
  - Secret word pattern updates to: _ R U _ _ (since U is fixed at position 3).

- **Inferences**:
  1. **Position of E**: From both feedbacks:
     - E cannot be at position 1 (ruled out by ""erupt"" feedback).
     - E cannot be at position 5 (ruled out by ""crane"" feedback).
     - Positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and U, so E must be at position 4. Thus, the secret word pattern is: _ R U E _.
  2. **Excluded letters**: C, A, N (from ""crane""), and P, T (from ""erupt""). Letters B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z are still possible for position 1 and position 5.
  3. **Possible words**: The word must fit the pattern _ R U E _ and be a valid English word. Common options:
     - **GRUEL** (G at position 1, L at position 5): ""Gruel"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a thin liquid food.
     - **DRUEL** (D at position 1, L at position 5): Less common and may be archaic; ""gruel"" is more standard.
     - Other words like **BRUCE** or **TRUCE** include excluded letters (B or T) and are invalid. **CRUEL** starts with C (excluded).
  4. **Choice of guess**: 
     - **GRUEL** tests:
        - Position 1: G (unconfirmed letter).
        - Position 4: E (should be ✓ if inference is correct).
        - Position 5: L (unconfirmed letter).
     - It uses new letters (G and L) to maximize information for future guesses and avoids excluded letters. If incorrect, the feedback will clarify the first or last letter.

Given this, **GRUEL** is a logical and efficient next guess to test the pattern and confirm the position of E.",Guess 3: gruel -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) U(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
