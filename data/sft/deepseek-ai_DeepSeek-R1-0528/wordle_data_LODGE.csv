We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

 This tells us:
 - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:
 - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to use common letters to maximize information.

 Let's consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about these.

 However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.

 Some possibilities:
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E

 We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.

 Let's choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don't know if there is another E.

 However, the feedback for the first word didn't show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it's possible there is another E? 
 But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don't know about other positions.

 But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don't have any indication of a double E, it's safer to use distinct letters.

 So, let's go with ""STOLE"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.

 But let me check: we want to maximize the number of new letters we test. We already know E is in the word and at the end, so we don't need to test E again? 
 Actually, we are testing the E at the same position (which we know is correct) so that's fine. But we are also testing other letters.

 However, note: the feedback for E was correct and in position 5, so in our next guess we should keep E in position 5 to avoid wasting a letter? 
 Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know that the word has an E at position 5, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' or an 'x'. 
 But we already know that E is at position 5, so we don't need to test it elsewhere? 

 However, the rules don't say that the word has only one E. It might have another E. But we don't have any information about that. 

 But to keep the guess efficient, we can keep E at the end and test other letters in the first four positions.

 So, we will keep E at the end and choose a word of the form ? ? ? ? E.

 We have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, O, L. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (E) but might have others. We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

 Since we already have E, we can test other vowels? But we know A is not in the word, so we can test O, I, U.

 ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel.

 Another candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E. This has I and K.

 But we don't know which is better.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""STOLE"".

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess and uses new letters. The first guess used C, R, A, N, E. We are avoiding C, R, A, N, and we are using E again at the end. So we are introducing S, T, O, L.

 That's four new letters. That's good.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We are not testing for that. But we don't have any indication of a double letter yet.

 Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).
- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending in **E**.
- Cannot include **C, R, A, N**.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, L, I**) to maximize information.

A strong candidate is **STOLE**:
- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging known correct placement.
- Tests **S, T, O, L**—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

This guess will clarify:
- If **S, T, O, L** exist in the word and their positions (via ✓ or -).
- Further narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

So the secret word ends with E.\n - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\n Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:\n - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)\n - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n We also want to use common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.\n\n Example words: \n   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don\'t know about these.\n\n However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E\n   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E\n\n We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\n However, the feedback for the first word didn\'t show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it\'s possible there is another E? \n But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don\'t have any indication of a double E, it\'s safer to use distinct letters.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""STOLE"".\n\n However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.\n\n But let me check: we want to maximize the number of new letters we test. We already know E is in the word and at the end, so we don\'t need to test E again? \n Actually, we are testing the E at the same position (which we know is correct) so that\'s fine. But we are also testing other letters.\n\n However, note: the feedback for E was correct and in position 5, so in our next guess we should keep E in position 5 to avoid wasting a letter? \n Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know that the word has an E at position 5, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a \'-\' or an \'x\'. \n But we already know that E is at position 5, so we don\'t need to test it elsewhere? \n\n However, the rules don\'t say that the word has only one E. It might have another E. But we don\'t have any information about that. \n\n But to keep the guess efficient, we can keep E at the end and test other letters in the first four positions.\n\n So, we will keep E at the end and choose a word of the form ? ? ? ? E.\n\n We have to avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses common letters that we haven\'t tried: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, O, L. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (E) but might have others. We haven\'t tested O, I, U, etc.\n\n Since we already have E, we can test other vowels? But we know A is not in the word, so we can test O, I, U.\n\n ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E. This has I and K.\n\n But we don\'t know which is better.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""STOLE"".\n\n However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat any letters from the first guess and uses new letters. The first guess used C, R, A, N, E. We are avoiding C, R, A, N, and we are using E again at the end. So we are introducing S, T, O, L.\n\n That\'s four new letters. That\'s good.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We are not testing for that.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the woord)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

Second guess: ""stole""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

What we know so far:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. The word contains an O, but not in position 3 (from ""stole"").
3. The word contains an L, but not in position 4 (from ""stole"").
4. The letters C, R, A, N, S, T are NOT in the word.

Now, let's list the constraints:
- Known letters: O, L, E (with E fixed at the end).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- O cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.

The word must be 5 letters ending in E, and contain O and L in some positions other than 3 and 4 respectively.

Since we have two confirmed letters (O and L) apart from E, and E is already placed, we need to find a word that has O, L, E, and two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.

We must avoid: C, R, A, N, S, T.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing O and L, and the other two letters from the available set above.

Possible words: Let's think of words ending with E that have O and L.

Since O and L must be in the word but not in the positions we tried (so O not in 3, L not in 4).

The word structure: _ _ _ _ E

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 fixed as E)

O could be in position 1, 2, or 4? But note position 4 had L in guess 2 and it was wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. But O could be in position 4? We don't know yet.

Similarly, O could be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

L could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

We must choose a word that places O and L in positions that are allowed.

Examples of words: 
- Could it be ""MOLE""? But M, O, L, E. However, ""MOLE"" is 4 letters? Wait, no, we need 5 letters. ""MOLE"" is 4. So not valid.

5-letter words: think of ""WHOLE""? But W, H, O, L, E. H and W are allowed? Yes, they are not forbidden.

Check positions: ""WHOLE"" -> W H O L E. 
- Position 3 is O? But feedback from ""stole"" had O in position 3 marked as ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3? That would be invalid if the secret word has O at position 3? But in ""stole"" we guessed O at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, so O cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""WHOLE"" has O at position 3, which is disallowed? So we should avoid words with O in position 3.

In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3, which we now know is incorrect for the secret word. So ""WHOLE"" is not possible? Actually, the secret word cannot have O at position 3 because when we guessed O at position 3 we got a '-' meaning it's wrong position. So if we try a word with O at position 3, it would be inconsistent. Thus, words with O in position 3 are not good.

Therefore, for a word to be valid, O must not be in position 3.

Similarly, L must not be in position 4.

So ""WHOLE"" would be invalid because O is in position 3? Yes.

Another word: ""MODEL"". But ""MODEL"" ends with L, not E? We need the last letter to be E, so fifth letter must be E.

Words ending in E: ""MODEL"" doesn't fit.

How about ""POLES""? But we have S, and S is forbidden? S was in ""stole"" and got x, so S is not in the word, so ""POLES"" has S, which should not be used.

We must avoid all forbidden letters.

Another word: ""BOOZE""? Ending E? No, ""BOOZE"" ends with E? B O O Z E, yes. But O is repeated? And Z is uncommon. Also, we have O at position 2 and 3? Position 3 has O, which is disallowed? So if we try it, position would be: 
- B (1), O (2), O (3), Z (4), E (5)

But O at position 3 is disallowed by the feedback (from ""stole""). So only one O? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple Os? The feedback only said O is in the word but wrong position. It could be that there is only one O, and we put it at position 3 which was wrong? Or there could be multiple Os. We don't know.

We have to consider the possibility. However, since we guessed one O and got a '-' indicating at least one O is present and not in that position? So if there were an O in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? But we didn't, so no O in position 3.

Similarly, no L in position 4.

But for ""BOOZE"": if we guess it, and the secret word has O in position 3? That's impossible because the feedback would have been wrong? No, what I mean is: the secret word cannot have O at position 3, because our guess had O at 3 and got a '-', meaning O is not at 3.

So ""BOOZE"" has O at 2 and 3? But position 3: if we guess O at position 3, it should be wrong? Unless the secret word has O at both positions? But that might be possible. However, we only know that O is in the word? And when we guessed O at position 3, it wasn't correct? So that position is wrong for O? But O could be at 2 or elsewhere.

""BOOZE"" might be acceptable? But its fourth letter is Z? And we haven't tested Z? Also, we must avoid S, T, etc.

But ""BOOZE"" ends with E, and contains O and L? Wait, ""BOOZE"" doesn't have L? We need L to be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback, L is in the word! And must be included.

In guess 2, L was marked as '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 4.

So any guess must include L and O? Also E.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and O (at least once), without C,R,A,N,S,T, and O not at position 3, L not at position 4.

Possible words:

- ""GLOBE"": G L O B E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But O at position 3: this is disallowed by the feedback? We guess O at position 3 in ""stole"" and it was '-', so O should not be at position 3. Therefore, O at position 3 in GLOBE would trigger the same problem? So if secret word had O at position 3, our guess ""stole"" would have had a ✓ for O? But it didn't, so no O at position 3. Therefore, ""GLOBE"" cannot be guessed because O is at position 3 which we know is incorrect? Actually, if we guess ""GLOBE"", we are putting O at position 3, and we know from feedback that position 3 is not O? So it would be a waste? Or maybe we test something else? But logically, we believe O cannot be at position 3? So we should not put O at position 3.

Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for O.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for L.

For ""GLOBE"", L is at position 2: that might be okay? But O at position 3 is bad.

So skip.

Alternative: ""WHOLE""? But we ruled it out because O at position 3? Same issue.

Another: ""LOUSE"" but has S? Disallowed.

Or ""FLUME""? F L U M E -> L at position 2, E at 5. But does it have O? No, we need O to be in the word? We must include O because feedback said O is present.

We must include both O and L? And E is at the end.

How about ""OILED""? O I L E D -> ends with D? Not E? So no.

Or ""OILER""? Has R? Disallowed? R is not allowed? R is forbidden? Yes, from guess 1.

Let's try ""BELLE""? But E in the middle? And not ending? And no O? Must contain O.

Another idea: ""GIVEN""? No O? 

Perhaps ""MOVIE""? Ends with E? M O V I E -> but only 5 letters? Positions: M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5). This word ends with E? Yes.

But does it contain L? No! We need L? Because L must be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback.

So missing L.

""DOLLY""? Not ending in E? And no O? Also, S and T forbidden? 

Another word: ""VOWEL"": V O W E L -> positions: V(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). This ends with L? Not E? We need ending with E.

""VOLES"": V O L E S -> ends with S? And S is not allowed? Also, position 4 is E? But last letter is S? So no.

""BOYLE""? B O Y L E -> positions: B(1), O(2), Y(3), L(4), E(5). Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O is at position 2? That might be okay? (different from position 3)
- L is at position 4? But from feedback, L cannot be at position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was at position 4 and got '-', so L is not in position 4? Therefore, we cannot put L at position 4.

So ""BOYLE"" has L at position 4, which we know is incorrect? So it would give the same L feedback? So the word must have L somewhere else? Not at position 4.

Therefore, ""BOYLE"" is invalid as a candidate? Or we can guess it? Surely we will get L at position 4 wrong? So it's a waste to put L at position 4.

Similarly, for O, position 3 is bad? And position 2 and others are okay.

Another candidate: ""PULLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""LOUIE"" is a word? Often a name? But valid Wordle? Not sure? In Wordle, words must be in the dictionary.

How about ""FLOLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""MODULE""? But that's 6 letters.

Back to 5 letters: ""HOLED""? H O L E D -> ends with D? Need E at last.

""OUNCE""? Has C? Disallowed.

""ULCER"" has R? Disallowed.

Another idea: ""FLOOD""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""GOLEM""? G O L E M -> ends with M? Not E.

""MODEL"": ends with L.

But what about ""COMFY""? No E? 

I think we need to focus on words with O, L, end with E, and avoid bad positions.

For example, ""OLLIE""? Not ending with E? 

Consider ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). 
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- But O at position 3: we know that position 3 cannot be O? Because from ""stole"" feedback, O at position 3 was marked as '-'? So if O were in position 3 in secret, we should have gotten a ✓ when we guessed it? But we didn't? So O cannot be in position 3? 

Therefore, ""GLOVE"" has O in position 3, which is not allowed? So this word is not possible? Or we can guess it? Actually, from feedback, we know the secret word cannot have O in position 3? So we don't need to guess O in position 3? 

But if we guess ""GLOVE"", we know O position 3 will be '-', and V will be tested? But we also have L in position 2? That might be okay.

But we can do better? Not to test in known wrong position? And also we learn less.

We want to test new positions for O and L.

For O, position 1, 2, or 4 are possible? (since 3 is out).

For L, position 1, 2, or 3 are possible? (since 4 is out).

Also, the word must end with E.

So possible word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = E.

Let me list possible positions:
- O can be in 1, 2, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: O and L might be the same position? No, only if double letter? But generally, different positions.

Possible word: with O in position 1? For example, ""OLIVE""? But V and I? ""OLIVE"": O L I V E
- Positions: O(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5)
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O at position 1: not tried before? So new position.
- L at position 2: not tried? In ""stole"", L was at position 4, so here we try L at position 2.
- Also, avoids forbidden letters? Used: O,L,I,V,E. E we know. O and L we know. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,T. I and V are new and not forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems good? But we need to check if it's valid.

OLIVE is a valid word.

Let's verify positions:
- O at position 1: not position 3, so okay? 
- L at position 2: not position 4, so okay.
- I and V: untested letters.

Similarly, we have E at the end.

So ""OLIVE"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""VOMIT""? No E at the end.

Or ""LANCE"" but A and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

""BOILS"" but ends with S and S forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems a strong choice.

But ""OLIVE"" has I and V.

Another word: ""MOVEL""? Not a word.

""LOVE"" is 4 letters.

""HOVEL"": H O V E L -> ends with L? Not E? So not.

""OVULE"" not a word, or sciency? O V U L E -> but V, U, L, E? Positions: O(1), V(2), U(3), L(4), E(5)? But L is at position 4? We know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"", L at position 4 gave '-', so L not at position 4? Therefore, ""OVULE"" would have L at position 4, which is disallowed? So not possible.

Similarly, ""PIECE"" not containing O or L.

So ""OLIVE"" seems promising.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? Not 5 letters? And C not allowed? 

So I think ""OLIVE"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""OLIVE"".

But let's double-check: 
- In ""stole"", O was at position 3 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not there. Now in ""OLIVE"", O is at position 1, which is new? So might get ✓ or -?
 Similarly, L at position 2, previously was not in that position? It might be correct or misplaced.

Also, it uses new letters I and V.

So we'll get information on O, L, I, V, and E at end should be ✓? Since we know E is at position 5.

So let's go with ""OLIVE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **From ""crane""**: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓). C, R, A, N are not in the word (x).
- **From ""stole""**: S and T are not in the word (x). O is in the word but not in position 3 (-). L is in the word but not in position 4 (-). E is in position 5 (✓).

### Current Constraints:
- The word **ends with E**.
- **O** must be in the word but **not in position 3**.
- **L** must be in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, T (not in the word at all).
- **Available positions** for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at position 3).
- **Available positions** for L: 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be at position 4).
- Must be a 5-letter English word with E at the end.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Prioritize placing **O and L in new positions** (O not in position 3, L not in position 4) to test their correct locations.
- Use **new, common consonants/vowels** from the allowed set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y) to maximize information.
- A strong candidate is **""OLIVE""**:
  - Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct placement.
  - Places **O at position 1** (new position, avoiding position 3).
  - Places **L at position 2** (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - Tests new letters **I and V**.
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, T are absent).

This guess will help:
- Confirm the placement of **O and L** (✓ if positions 1/2 are correct, - if misplaced).
- Test **I and V** (✓/-/x), eliminating more possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>olive</guess>",olive,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the woord)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

Second guess: ""stole""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

What we know so far:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. The word contains an O, but not in position 3 (from ""stole"").
3. The word contains an L, but not in position 4 (from ""stole"").
4. The letters C, R, A, N, S, T are NOT in the word.

Now, let's list the constraints:
- Known letters: O, L, E (with E fixed at the end).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- O cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.

The word must be 5 letters ending in E, and contain O and L in some positions other than 3 and 4 respectively.

Since we have two confirmed letters (O and L) apart from E, and E is already placed, we need to find a word that has O, L, E, and two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.

We must avoid: C, R, A, N, S, T.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing O and L, and the other two letters from the available set above.

Possible words: Let's think of words ending with E that have O and L.

Since O and L must be in the word but not in the positions we tried (so O not in 3, L not in 4).

The word structure: _ _ _ _ E

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 fixed as E)

O could be in position 1, 2, or 4? But note position 4 had L in guess 2 and it was wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. But O could be in position 4? We don't know yet.

Similarly, O could be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

L could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

We must choose a word that places O and L in positions that are allowed.

Examples of words: 
- Could it be ""MOLE""? But M, O, L, E. However, ""MOLE"" is 4 letters? Wait, no, we need 5 letters. ""MOLE"" is 4. So not valid.

5-letter words: think of ""WHOLE""? But W, H, O, L, E. H and W are allowed? Yes, they are not forbidden.

Check positions: ""WHOLE"" -> W H O L E. 
- Position 3 is O? But feedback from ""stole"" had O in position 3 marked as ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3? That would be invalid if the secret word has O at position 3? But in ""stole"" we guessed O at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, so O cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""WHOLE"" has O at position 3, which is disallowed? So we should avoid words with O in position 3.

In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3, which we now know is incorrect for the secret word. So ""WHOLE"" is not possible? Actually, the secret word cannot have O at position 3 because when we guessed O at position 3 we got a '-' meaning it's wrong position. So if we try a word with O at position 3, it would be inconsistent. Thus, words with O in position 3 are not good.

Therefore, for a word to be valid, O must not be in position 3.

Similarly, L must not be in position 4.

So ""WHOLE"" would be invalid because O is in position 3? Yes.

Another word: ""MODEL"". But ""MODEL"" ends with L, not E? We need the last letter to be E, so fifth letter must be E.

Words ending in E: ""MODEL"" doesn't fit.

How about ""POLES""? But we have S, and S is forbidden? S was in ""stole"" and got x, so S is not in the word, so ""POLES"" has S, which should not be used.

We must avoid all forbidden letters.

Another word: ""BOOZE""? Ending E? No, ""BOOZE"" ends with E? B O O Z E, yes. But O is repeated? And Z is uncommon. Also, we have O at position 2 and 3? Position 3 has O, which is disallowed? So if we try it, position would be: 
- B (1), O (2), O (3), Z (4), E (5)

But O at position 3 is disallowed by the feedback (from ""stole""). So only one O? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple Os? The feedback only said O is in the word but wrong position. It could be that there is only one O, and we put it at position 3 which was wrong? Or there could be multiple Os. We don't know.

We have to consider the possibility. However, since we guessed one O and got a '-' indicating at least one O is present and not in that position? So if there were an O in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? But we didn't, so no O in position 3.

Similarly, no L in position 4.

But for ""BOOZE"": if we guess it, and the secret word has O in position 3? That's impossible because the feedback would have been wrong? No, what I mean is: the secret word cannot have O at position 3, because our guess had O at 3 and got a '-', meaning O is not at 3.

So ""BOOZE"" has O at 2 and 3? But position 3: if we guess O at position 3, it should be wrong? Unless the secret word has O at both positions? But that might be possible. However, we only know that O is in the word? And when we guessed O at position 3, it wasn't correct? So that position is wrong for O? But O could be at 2 or elsewhere.

""BOOZE"" might be acceptable? But its fourth letter is Z? And we haven't tested Z? Also, we must avoid S, T, etc.

But ""BOOZE"" ends with E, and contains O and L? Wait, ""BOOZE"" doesn't have L? We need L to be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback, L is in the word! And must be included.

In guess 2, L was marked as '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 4.

So any guess must include L and O? Also E.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and O (at least once), without C,R,A,N,S,T, and O not at position 3, L not at position 4.

Possible words:

- ""GLOBE"": G L O B E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But O at position 3: this is disallowed by the feedback? We guess O at position 3 in ""stole"" and it was '-', so O should not be at position 3. Therefore, O at position 3 in GLOBE would trigger the same problem? So if secret word had O at position 3, our guess ""stole"" would have had a ✓ for O? But it didn't, so no O at position 3. Therefore, ""GLOBE"" cannot be guessed because O is at position 3 which we know is incorrect? Actually, if we guess ""GLOBE"", we are putting O at position 3, and we know from feedback that position 3 is not O? So it would be a waste? Or maybe we test something else? But logically, we believe O cannot be at position 3? So we should not put O at position 3.

Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for O.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for L.

For ""GLOBE"", L is at position 2: that might be okay? But O at position 3 is bad.

So skip.

Alternative: ""WHOLE""? But we ruled it out because O at position 3? Same issue.

Another: ""LOUSE"" but has S? Disallowed.

Or ""FLUME""? F L U M E -> L at position 2, E at 5. But does it have O? No, we need O to be in the word? We must include O because feedback said O is present.

We must include both O and L? And E is at the end.

How about ""OILED""? O I L E D -> ends with D? Not E? So no.

Or ""OILER""? Has R? Disallowed? R is not allowed? R is forbidden? Yes, from guess 1.

Let's try ""BELLE""? But E in the middle? And not ending? And no O? Must contain O.

Another idea: ""GIVEN""? No O? 

Perhaps ""MOVIE""? Ends with E? M O V I E -> but only 5 letters? Positions: M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5). This word ends with E? Yes.

But does it contain L? No! We need L? Because L must be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback.

So missing L.

""DOLLY""? Not ending in E? And no O? Also, S and T forbidden? 

Another word: ""VOWEL"": V O W E L -> positions: V(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). This ends with L? Not E? We need ending with E.

""VOLES"": V O L E S -> ends with S? And S is not allowed? Also, position 4 is E? But last letter is S? So no.

""BOYLE""? B O Y L E -> positions: B(1), O(2), Y(3), L(4), E(5). Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O is at position 2? That might be okay? (different from position 3)
- L is at position 4? But from feedback, L cannot be at position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was at position 4 and got '-', so L is not in position 4? Therefore, we cannot put L at position 4.

So ""BOYLE"" has L at position 4, which we know is incorrect? So it would give the same L feedback? So the word must have L somewhere else? Not at position 4.

Therefore, ""BOYLE"" is invalid as a candidate? Or we can guess it? Surely we will get L at position 4 wrong? So it's a waste to put L at position 4.

Similarly, for O, position 3 is bad? And position 2 and others are okay.

Another candidate: ""PULLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""LOUIE"" is a word? Often a name? But valid Wordle? Not sure? In Wordle, words must be in the dictionary.

How about ""FLOLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""MODULE""? But that's 6 letters.

Back to 5 letters: ""HOLED""? H O L E D -> ends with D? Need E at last.

""OUNCE""? Has C? Disallowed.

""ULCER"" has R? Disallowed.

Another idea: ""FLOOD""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""GOLEM""? G O L E M -> ends with M? Not E.

""MODEL"": ends with L.

But what about ""COMFY""? No E? 

I think we need to focus on words with O, L, end with E, and avoid bad positions.

For example, ""OLLIE""? Not ending with E? 

Consider ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). 
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- But O at position 3: we know that position 3 cannot be O? Because from ""stole"" feedback, O at position 3 was marked as '-'? So if O were in position 3 in secret, we should have gotten a ✓ when we guessed it? But we didn't? So O cannot be in position 3? 

Therefore, ""GLOVE"" has O in position 3, which is not allowed? So this word is not possible? Or we can guess it? Actually, from feedback, we know the secret word cannot have O in position 3? So we don't need to guess O in position 3? 

But if we guess ""GLOVE"", we know O position 3 will be '-', and V will be tested? But we also have L in position 2? That might be okay.

But we can do better? Not to test in known wrong position? And also we learn less.

We want to test new positions for O and L.

For O, position 1, 2, or 4 are possible? (since 3 is out).

For L, position 1, 2, or 3 are possible? (since 4 is out).

Also, the word must end with E.

So possible word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = E.

Let me list possible positions:
- O can be in 1, 2, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: O and L might be the same position? No, only if double letter? But generally, different positions.

Possible word: with O in position 1? For example, ""OLIVE""? But V and I? ""OLIVE"": O L I V E
- Positions: O(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5)
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O at position 1: not tried before? So new position.
- L at position 2: not tried? In ""stole"", L was at position 4, so here we try L at position 2.
- Also, avoids forbidden letters? Used: O,L,I,V,E. E we know. O and L we know. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,T. I and V are new and not forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems good? But we need to check if it's valid.

OLIVE is a valid word.

Let's verify positions:
- O at position 1: not position 3, so okay? 
- L at position 2: not position 4, so okay.
- I and V: untested letters.

Similarly, we have E at the end.

So ""OLIVE"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""VOMIT""? No E at the end.

Or ""LANCE"" but A and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

""BOILS"" but ends with S and S forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems a strong choice.

But ""OLIVE"" has I and V.

Another word: ""MOVEL""? Not a word.

""LOVE"" is 4 letters.

""HOVEL"": H O V E L -> ends with L? Not E? So not.

""OVULE"" not a word, or sciency? O V U L E -> but V, U, L, E? Positions: O(1), V(2), U(3), L(4), E(5)? But L is at position 4? We know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"", L at position 4 gave '-', so L not at position 4? Therefore, ""OVULE"" would have L at position 4, which is disallowed? So not possible.

Similarly, ""PIECE"" not containing O or L.

So ""OLIVE"" seems promising.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? Not 5 letters? And C not allowed? 

So I think ""OLIVE"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""OLIVE"".

But let's double-check: 
- In ""stole"", O was at position 3 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not there. Now in ""OLIVE"", O is at position 1, which is new? So might get ✓ or -?
 Similarly, L at position 2, previously was not in that position? It might be correct or misplaced.

Also, it uses new letters I and V.

So we'll get information on O, L, I, V, and E at end should be ✓? Since we know E is at position 5.

So let's go with ""OLIVE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **From ""crane""**: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓). C, R, A, N are not in the word (x).
- **From ""stole""**: S and T are not in the word (x). O is in the word but not in position 3 (-). L is in the word but not in position 4 (-). E is in position 5 (✓).

### Current Constraints:
- The word **ends with E**.
- **O** must be in the word but **not in position 3**.
- **L** must be in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, T (not in the word at all).
- **Available positions** for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at position 3).
- **Available positions** for L: 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be at position 4).
- Must be a 5-letter English word with E at the end.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Prioritize placing **O and L in new positions** (O not in position 3, L not in position 4) to test their correct locations.
- Use **new, common consonants/vowels** from the allowed set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y) to maximize information.
- A strong candidate is **""OLIVE""**:
  - Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct placement.
  - Places **O at position 1** (new position, avoiding position 3).
  - Places **L at position 2** (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - Tests new letters **I and V**.
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, T are absent).

This guess will help:
- Confirm the placement of **O and L** (✓ if positions 1/2 are correct, - if misplaced).
- Test **I and V** (✓/-/x), eliminating more possibilities for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: olive -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(-) I(x) V(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,LODGE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

 This tells us:
 - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:
 - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to use common letters to maximize information.

 Let's consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about these.

 However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.

 Some possibilities:
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E

 We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.

 Let's choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don't know if there is another E.

 However, the feedback for the first word didn't show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it's possible there is another E? 
 But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don't know about other positions.

 But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don't have any indication of a double E, it's safer to use distinct letters.

 So, let's go with ""STOLE"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.

 But let me check: we want to maximize the number of new letters we test. We already know E is in the word and at the end, so we don't need to test E again? 
 Actually, we are testing the E at the same position (which we know is correct) so that's fine. But we are also testing other letters.

 However, note: the feedback for E was correct and in position 5, so in our next guess we should keep E in position 5 to avoid wasting a letter? 
 Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know that the word has an E at position 5, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' or an 'x'. 
 But we already know that E is at position 5, so we don't need to test it elsewhere? 

 However, the rules don't say that the word has only one E. It might have another E. But we don't have any information about that. 

 But to keep the guess efficient, we can keep E at the end and test other letters in the first four positions.

 So, we will keep E at the end and choose a word of the form ? ? ? ? E.

 We have to avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's choose a word that uses common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, O, L. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (E) but might have others. We haven't tested O, I, U, etc.

 Since we already have E, we can test other vowels? But we know A is not in the word, so we can test O, I, U.

 ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel.

 Another candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E. This has I and K.

 But we don't know which is better.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""STOLE"".

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't repeat any letters from the first guess and uses new letters. The first guess used C, R, A, N, E. We are avoiding C, R, A, N, and we are using E again at the end. So we are introducing S, T, O, L.

 That's four new letters. That's good.

 So, I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We are not testing for that. But we don't have any indication of a double letter yet.

 Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).
- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending in **E**.
- Cannot include **C, R, A, N**.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, L, I**) to maximize information.

A strong candidate is **STOLE**:
- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging known correct placement.
- Tests **S, T, O, L**—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

This guess will clarify:
- If **S, T, O, L** exist in the word and their positions (via ✓ or -).
- Further narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) L(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the woord)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

Second guess: ""stole""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

What we know so far:
1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. The word contains an O, but not in position 3 (from ""stole"").
3. The word contains an L, but not in position 4 (from ""stole"").
4. The letters C, R, A, N, S, T are NOT in the word.

Now, let's list the constraints:
- Known letters: O, L, E (with E fixed at the end).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.
- O cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.

The word must be 5 letters ending in E, and contain O and L in some positions other than 3 and 4 respectively.

Since we have two confirmed letters (O and L) apart from E, and E is already placed, we need to find a word that has O, L, E, and two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.

We must avoid: C, R, A, N, S, T.

Common letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing O and L, and the other two letters from the available set above.

Possible words: Let's think of words ending with E that have O and L.

Since O and L must be in the word but not in the positions we tried (so O not in 3, L not in 4).

The word structure: _ _ _ _ E

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 fixed as E)

O could be in position 1, 2, or 4? But note position 4 had L in guess 2 and it was wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. But O could be in position 4? We don't know yet.

Similarly, O could be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

L could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

We must choose a word that places O and L in positions that are allowed.

Examples of words: 
- Could it be ""MOLE""? But M, O, L, E. However, ""MOLE"" is 4 letters? Wait, no, we need 5 letters. ""MOLE"" is 4. So not valid.

5-letter words: think of ""WHOLE""? But W, H, O, L, E. H and W are allowed? Yes, they are not forbidden.

Check positions: ""WHOLE"" -> W H O L E. 
- Position 3 is O? But feedback from ""stole"" had O in position 3 marked as ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3? That would be invalid if the secret word has O at position 3? But in ""stole"" we guessed O at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, so O cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""WHOLE"" has O at position 3, which is disallowed? So we should avoid words with O in position 3.

In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3, which we now know is incorrect for the secret word. So ""WHOLE"" is not possible? Actually, the secret word cannot have O at position 3 because when we guessed O at position 3 we got a '-' meaning it's wrong position. So if we try a word with O at position 3, it would be inconsistent. Thus, words with O in position 3 are not good.

Therefore, for a word to be valid, O must not be in position 3.

Similarly, L must not be in position 4.

So ""WHOLE"" would be invalid because O is in position 3? Yes.

Another word: ""MODEL"". But ""MODEL"" ends with L, not E? We need the last letter to be E, so fifth letter must be E.

Words ending in E: ""MODEL"" doesn't fit.

How about ""POLES""? But we have S, and S is forbidden? S was in ""stole"" and got x, so S is not in the word, so ""POLES"" has S, which should not be used.

We must avoid all forbidden letters.

Another word: ""BOOZE""? Ending E? No, ""BOOZE"" ends with E? B O O Z E, yes. But O is repeated? And Z is uncommon. Also, we have O at position 2 and 3? Position 3 has O, which is disallowed? So if we try it, position would be: 
- B (1), O (2), O (3), Z (4), E (5)

But O at position 3 is disallowed by the feedback (from ""stole""). So only one O? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple Os? The feedback only said O is in the word but wrong position. It could be that there is only one O, and we put it at position 3 which was wrong? Or there could be multiple Os. We don't know.

We have to consider the possibility. However, since we guessed one O and got a '-' indicating at least one O is present and not in that position? So if there were an O in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? But we didn't, so no O in position 3.

Similarly, no L in position 4.

But for ""BOOZE"": if we guess it, and the secret word has O in position 3? That's impossible because the feedback would have been wrong? No, what I mean is: the secret word cannot have O at position 3, because our guess had O at 3 and got a '-', meaning O is not at 3.

So ""BOOZE"" has O at 2 and 3? But position 3: if we guess O at position 3, it should be wrong? Unless the secret word has O at both positions? But that might be possible. However, we only know that O is in the word? And when we guessed O at position 3, it wasn't correct? So that position is wrong for O? But O could be at 2 or elsewhere.

""BOOZE"" might be acceptable? But its fourth letter is Z? And we haven't tested Z? Also, we must avoid S, T, etc.

But ""BOOZE"" ends with E, and contains O and L? Wait, ""BOOZE"" doesn't have L? We need L to be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback, L is in the word! And must be included.

In guess 2, L was marked as '-', meaning L is in the word but not at position 4.

So any guess must include L and O? Also E.

So we need a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and O (at least once), without C,R,A,N,S,T, and O not at position 3, L not at position 4.

Possible words:

- ""GLOBE"": G L O B E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But O at position 3: this is disallowed by the feedback? We guess O at position 3 in ""stole"" and it was '-', so O should not be at position 3. Therefore, O at position 3 in GLOBE would trigger the same problem? So if secret word had O at position 3, our guess ""stole"" would have had a ✓ for O? But it didn't, so no O at position 3. Therefore, ""GLOBE"" cannot be guessed because O is at position 3 which we know is incorrect? Actually, if we guess ""GLOBE"", we are putting O at position 3, and we know from feedback that position 3 is not O? So it would be a waste? Or maybe we test something else? But logically, we believe O cannot be at position 3? So we should not put O at position 3.

Therefore, we must avoid position 3 for O.

Similarly, avoid position 4 for L.

For ""GLOBE"", L is at position 2: that might be okay? But O at position 3 is bad.

So skip.

Alternative: ""WHOLE""? But we ruled it out because O at position 3? Same issue.

Another: ""LOUSE"" but has S? Disallowed.

Or ""FLUME""? F L U M E -> L at position 2, E at 5. But does it have O? No, we need O to be in the word? We must include O because feedback said O is present.

We must include both O and L? And E is at the end.

How about ""OILED""? O I L E D -> ends with D? Not E? So no.

Or ""OILER""? Has R? Disallowed? R is not allowed? R is forbidden? Yes, from guess 1.

Let's try ""BELLE""? But E in the middle? And not ending? And no O? Must contain O.

Another idea: ""GIVEN""? No O? 

Perhaps ""MOVIE""? Ends with E? M O V I E -> but only 5 letters? Positions: M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5). This word ends with E? Yes.

But does it contain L? No! We need L? Because L must be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback.

So missing L.

""DOLLY""? Not ending in E? And no O? Also, S and T forbidden? 

Another word: ""VOWEL"": V O W E L -> positions: V(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). This ends with L? Not E? We need ending with E.

""VOLES"": V O L E S -> ends with S? And S is not allowed? Also, position 4 is E? But last letter is S? So no.

""BOYLE""? B O Y L E -> positions: B(1), O(2), Y(3), L(4), E(5). Check:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O is at position 2? That might be okay? (different from position 3)
- L is at position 4? But from feedback, L cannot be at position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was at position 4 and got '-', so L is not in position 4? Therefore, we cannot put L at position 4.

So ""BOYLE"" has L at position 4, which we know is incorrect? So it would give the same L feedback? So the word must have L somewhere else? Not at position 4.

Therefore, ""BOYLE"" is invalid as a candidate? Or we can guess it? Surely we will get L at position 4 wrong? So it's a waste to put L at position 4.

Similarly, for O, position 3 is bad? And position 2 and others are okay.

Another candidate: ""PULLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""LOUIE"" is a word? Often a name? But valid Wordle? Not sure? In Wordle, words must be in the dictionary.

How about ""FLOLE""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""MODULE""? But that's 6 letters.

Back to 5 letters: ""HOLED""? H O L E D -> ends with D? Need E at last.

""OUNCE""? Has C? Disallowed.

""ULCER"" has R? Disallowed.

Another idea: ""FLOOD""? Doesn't end with E.

Perhaps ""GOLEM""? G O L E M -> ends with M? Not E.

""MODEL"": ends with L.

But what about ""COMFY""? No E? 

I think we need to focus on words with O, L, end with E, and avoid bad positions.

For example, ""OLLIE""? Not ending with E? 

Consider ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). 
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- But O at position 3: we know that position 3 cannot be O? Because from ""stole"" feedback, O at position 3 was marked as '-'? So if O were in position 3 in secret, we should have gotten a ✓ when we guessed it? But we didn't? So O cannot be in position 3? 

Therefore, ""GLOVE"" has O in position 3, which is not allowed? So this word is not possible? Or we can guess it? Actually, from feedback, we know the secret word cannot have O in position 3? So we don't need to guess O in position 3? 

But if we guess ""GLOVE"", we know O position 3 will be '-', and V will be tested? But we also have L in position 2? That might be okay.

But we can do better? Not to test in known wrong position? And also we learn less.

We want to test new positions for O and L.

For O, position 1, 2, or 4 are possible? (since 3 is out).

For L, position 1, 2, or 3 are possible? (since 4 is out).

Also, the word must end with E.

So possible word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = E.

Let me list possible positions:
- O can be in 1, 2, or 4.
- L can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: O and L might be the same position? No, only if double letter? But generally, different positions.

Possible word: with O in position 1? For example, ""OLIVE""? But V and I? ""OLIVE"": O L I V E
- Positions: O(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5)
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains O and L.
- O at position 1: not tried before? So new position.
- L at position 2: not tried? In ""stole"", L was at position 4, so here we try L at position 2.
- Also, avoids forbidden letters? Used: O,L,I,V,E. E we know. O and L we know. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,T. I and V are new and not forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems good? But we need to check if it's valid.

OLIVE is a valid word.

Let's verify positions:
- O at position 1: not position 3, so okay? 
- L at position 2: not position 4, so okay.
- I and V: untested letters.

Similarly, we have E at the end.

So ""OLIVE"" is a good candidate.

Another word: ""VOMIT""? No E at the end.

Or ""LANCE"" but A and N are forbidden? Not allowed.

""BOILS"" but ends with S and S forbidden.

So ""OLIVE"" seems a strong choice.

But ""OLIVE"" has I and V.

Another word: ""MOVEL""? Not a word.

""LOVE"" is 4 letters.

""HOVEL"": H O V E L -> ends with L? Not E? So not.

""OVULE"" not a word, or sciency? O V U L E -> but V, U, L, E? Positions: O(1), V(2), U(3), L(4), E(5)? But L is at position 4? We know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"", L at position 4 gave '-', so L not at position 4? Therefore, ""OVULE"" would have L at position 4, which is disallowed? So not possible.

Similarly, ""PIECE"" not containing O or L.

So ""OLIVE"" seems promising.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? Not 5 letters? And C not allowed? 

So I think ""OLIVE"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""OLIVE"".

But let's double-check: 
- In ""stole"", O was at position 3 and got '-', meaning O is in the word but not there. Now in ""OLIVE"", O is at position 1, which is new? So might get ✓ or -?
 Similarly, L at position 2, previously was not in that position? It might be correct or misplaced.

Also, it uses new letters I and V.

So we'll get information on O, L, I, V, and E at end should be ✓? Since we know E is at position 5.

So let's go with ""OLIVE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **From ""crane""**: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓). C, R, A, N are not in the word (x).
- **From ""stole""**: S and T are not in the word (x). O is in the word but not in position 3 (-). L is in the word but not in position 4 (-). E is in position 5 (✓).

### Current Constraints:
- The word **ends with E**.
- **O** must be in the word but **not in position 3**.
- **L** must be in the word but **not in position 4**.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, T (not in the word at all).
- **Available positions** for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can't be at position 3).
- **Available positions** for L: 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be at position 4).
- Must be a 5-letter English word with E at the end.

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Prioritize placing **O and L in new positions** (O not in position 3, L not in position 4) to test their correct locations.
- Use **new, common consonants/vowels** from the allowed set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y) to maximize information.
- A strong candidate is **""OLIVE""**:
  - Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct placement.
  - Places **O at position 1** (new position, avoiding position 3).
  - Places **L at position 2** (new position, avoiding position 4).
  - Tests new letters **I and V**.
  - Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, T are absent).

This guess will help:
- Confirm the placement of **O and L** (✓ if positions 1/2 are correct, - if misplaced).
- Test **I and V** (✓/-/x), eliminating more possibilities for subsequent guesses.

So the secret word ends with E.\n - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\n Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:\n - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)\n - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n We also want to use common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.\n\n Example words: \n   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don\'t know about these.\n\n However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E\n   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E\n\n We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\n However, the feedback for the first word didn\'t show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it\'s possible there is another E? \n But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don\'t have any indication of a double E, it\'s safer to use distinct letters.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""STOLE"".\n\n However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.\n\n But let me check: we want to maximize the number of new letters we test. We already know E is in the word and at the end, so we don\'t need to test E again? \n Actually, we are testing the E at the same position (which we know is correct) so that\'s fine. But we are also testing other letters.\n\n However, note: the feedback for E was correct and in position 5, so in our next guess we should keep E in position 5 to avoid wasting a letter? \n Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know that the word has an E at position 5, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a \'-\' or an \'x\'. \n But we already know that E is at position 5, so we don\'t need to test it elsewhere? \n\n However, the rules don\'t say that the word has only one E. It might have another E. But we don\'t have any information about that. \n\n But to keep the guess efficient, we can keep E at the end and test other letters in the first four positions.\n\n So, we will keep E at the end and choose a word of the form ? ? ? ? E.\n\n We have to avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that uses common letters that we haven\'t tried: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate: S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, O, L. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (E) but might have others. We haven\'t tested O, I, U, etc.\n\n Since we already have E, we can test other vowels? But we know A is not in the word, so we can test O, I, U.\n\n ""STOLE"" has O, which is a vowel.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E. This has I and K.\n\n But we don\'t know which is better.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me choose ""STOLE"".\n\n However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat any letters from the first guess and uses new letters. The first guess used C, R, A, N, E. We are avoiding C, R, A, N, and we are using E again at the end. So we are introducing S, T, O, L.\n\n That\'s four new letters. That\'s good.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We are not testing for that. But we don\'t have any indication of a double letter yet.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""STOLE"".\n\n<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).\n- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word ending in **E**.\n- Cannot include **C, R, A, N**.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, L, I**) to maximize information.\n\nA strong candidate is **STOLE**:\n- Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging known correct placement.\n- Tests **S, T, O, L**—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).\n\nThis guess will clarify:\n- If **S, T, O, L** exist in the word and their positions (via ✓ or -).\n- Further narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) L(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the woord)\n- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)\n\nSecond guess: ""stole""\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- O: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n1. The word ends with E (position 5).\n2. The word contains an O, but not in position 3 (from ""stole"").\n3. The word contains an L, but not in position 4 (from ""stole"").\n4. The letters C, R, A, N, S, T are NOT in the word.\n\nNow, let\'s list the constraints:\n- Known letters: O, L, E (with E fixed at the end).\n- Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, T.\n- O cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.\n\nThe word must be 5 letters ending in E, and contain O and L in some positions other than 3 and 4 respectively.\n\nSince we have two confirmed letters (O and L) apart from E, and E is already placed, we need to find a word that has O, L, E, and two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.\n\nWe must avoid: C, R, A, N, S, T.\n\nCommon letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, containing O and L, and the other two letters from the available set above.\n\nPossible words: Let\'s think of words ending with E that have O and L.\n\nSince O and L must be in the word but not in the positions we tried (so O not in 3, L not in 4).\n\nThe word structure: _ _ _ _ E\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 fixed as E)\n\nO could be in position 1, 2, or 4? But note position 4 had L in guess 2 and it was wrong position, so L cannot be in position 4. But O could be in position 4? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, O could be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).\n\nL could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).\n\nWe must choose a word that places O and L in positions that are allowed.\n\nExamples of words: \n- Could it be ""MOLE""? But M, O, L, E. However, ""MOLE"" is 4 letters? Wait, no, we need 5 letters. ""MOLE"" is 4. So not valid.\n\n5-letter words: think of ""WHOLE""? But W, H, O, L, E. H and W are allowed? Yes, they are not forbidden.\n\nCheck positions: ""WHOLE"" -> W H O L E. \n- Position 3 is O? But feedback from ""stole"" had O in position 3 marked as ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 3. In ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3? That would be invalid if the secret word has O at position 3? But in ""stole"" we guessed O at position 3 and it was marked wrong position, so O cannot be in position 3. Therefore, ""WHOLE"" has O at position 3, which is disallowed? So we should avoid words with O in position 3.\n\nIn ""WHOLE"", O is at position 3, which we now know is incorrect for the secret word. So ""WHOLE"" is not possible? Actually, the secret word cannot have O at position 3 because when we guessed O at position 3 we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s wrong position. So if we try a word with O at position 3, it would be inconsistent. Thus, words with O in position 3 are not good.\n\nTherefore, for a word to be valid, O must not be in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, L must not be in position 4.\n\nSo ""WHOLE"" would be invalid because O is in position 3? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""MODEL"". But ""MODEL"" ends with L, not E? We need the last letter to be E, so fifth letter must be E.\n\nWords ending in E: ""MODEL"" doesn\'t fit.\n\nHow about ""POLES""? But we have S, and S is forbidden? S was in ""stole"" and got x, so S is not in the word, so ""POLES"" has S, which should not be used.\n\nWe must avoid all forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BOOZE""? Ending E? No, ""BOOZE"" ends with E? B O O Z E, yes. But O is repeated? And Z is uncommon. Also, we have O at position 2 and 3? Position 3 has O, which is disallowed? So if we try it, position would be: \n- B (1), O (2), O (3), Z (4), E (5)\n\nBut O at position 3 is disallowed by the feedback (from ""stole""). So only one O? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple Os? The feedback only said O is in the word but wrong position. It could be that there is only one O, and we put it at position 3 which was wrong? Or there could be multiple Os. We don\'t know.\n\nWe have to consider the possibility. However, since we guessed one O and got a \'-\' indicating at least one O is present and not in that position? So if there were an O in position 3, we would have gotten a ✓? But we didn\'t, so no O in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, no L in position 4.\n\nBut for ""BOOZE"": if we guess it, and the secret word has O in position 3? That\'s impossible because the feedback would have been wrong? No, what I mean is: the secret word cannot have O at position 3, because our guess had O at 3 and got a \'-\', meaning O is not at 3.\n\nSo ""BOOZE"" has O at 2 and 3? But position 3: if we guess O at position 3, it should be wrong? Unless the secret word has O at both positions? But that might be possible. However, we only know that O is in the word? And when we guessed O at position 3, it wasn\'t correct? So that position is wrong for O? But O could be at 2 or elsewhere.\n\n""BOOZE"" might be acceptable? But its fourth letter is Z? And we haven\'t tested Z? Also, we must avoid S, T, etc.\n\nBut ""BOOZE"" ends with E, and contains O and L? Wait, ""BOOZE"" doesn\'t have L? We need L to be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback, L is in the word! And must be included.\n\nIn guess 2, L was marked as \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nSo any guess must include L and O? Also E.\n\nSo we need a 5-letter word ending with E, containing L and O (at least once), without C,R,A,N,S,T, and O not at position 3, L not at position 4.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""GLOBE"": G L O B E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). But O at position 3: this is disallowed by the feedback? We guess O at position 3 in ""stole"" and it was \'-\', so O should not be at position 3. Therefore, O at position 3 in GLOBE would trigger the same problem? So if secret word had O at position 3, our guess ""stole"" would have had a ✓ for O? But it didn\'t, so no O at position 3. Therefore, ""GLOBE"" cannot be guessed because O is at position 3 which we know is incorrect? Actually, if we guess ""GLOBE"", we are putting O at position 3, and we know from feedback that position 3 is not O? So it would be a waste? Or maybe we test something else? But logically, we believe O cannot be at position 3? So we should not put O at position 3.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid position 3 for O.\n\nSimilarly, avoid position 4 for L.\n\nFor ""GLOBE"", L is at position 2: that might be okay? But O at position 3 is bad.\n\nSo skip.\n\nAlternative: ""WHOLE""? But we ruled it out because O at position 3? Same issue.\n\nAnother: ""LOUSE"" but has S? Disallowed.\n\nOr ""FLUME""? F L U M E -> L at position 2, E at 5. But does it have O? No, we need O to be in the word? We must include O because feedback said O is present.\n\nWe must include both O and L? And E is at the end.\n\nHow about ""OILED""? O I L E D -> ends with D? Not E? So no.\n\nOr ""OILER""? Has R? Disallowed? R is not allowed? R is forbidden? Yes, from guess 1.\n\nLet\'s try ""BELLE""? But E in the middle? And not ending? And no O? Must contain O.\n\nAnother idea: ""GIVEN""? No O? \n\nPerhaps ""MOVIE""? Ends with E? M O V I E -> but only 5 letters? Positions: M(1), O(2), V(3), I(4), E(5). This word ends with E? Yes.\n\nBut does it contain L? No! We need L? Because L must be in the word? From ""stole"" feedback.\n\nSo missing L.\n\n""DOLLY""? Not ending in E? And no O? Also, S and T forbidden? \n\nAnother word: ""VOWEL"": V O W E L -> positions: V(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), L(5). This ends with L? Not E? We need ending with E.\n\n""VOLES"": V O L E S -> ends with S? And S is not allowed? Also, position 4 is E? But last letter is S? So no.\n\n""BOYLE""? B O Y L E -> positions: B(1), O(2), Y(3), L(4), E(5). Check:\n- Ends with E: yes.\n- Contains O and L.\n- O is at position 2? That might be okay? (different from position 3)\n- L is at position 4? But from feedback, L cannot be at position 4? Because in ""stole"", L was at position 4 and got \'-\', so L is not in position 4? Therefore, we cannot put L at position 4.\n\nSo ""BOYLE"" has L at position 4, which we know is incorrect? So it would give the same L feedback? So the word must have L somewhere else? Not at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""BOYLE"" is invalid as a candidate? Or we can guess it? Surely we will get L at position 4 wrong? So it\'s a waste to put L at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, for O, position 3 is bad? And position 2 and others are okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PULLE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""LOUIE"" is a word? Often a name? But valid Wordle? Not sure? In Wordle, words must be in the dictionary.\n\nHow about ""FLOLE""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""MODULE""? But that\'s 6 letters.\n\nBack to 5 letters: ""HOLED""? H O L E D -> ends with D? Need E at last.\n\n""OUNCE""? Has C? Disallowed.\n\n""ULCER"" has R? Disallowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""FLOOD""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\nPerhaps ""GOLEM""? G O L E M -> ends with M? Not E.\n\n""MODEL"": ends with L.\n\nBut what about ""COMFY""? No E? \n\nI think we need to focus on words with O, L, end with E, and avoid bad positions.\n\nFor example, ""OLLIE""? Not ending with E? \n\nConsider ""GLOVE"": G L O V E -> positions: G(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). \n- Ends with E: yes.\n- Contains O and L.\n- But O at position 3: we know that position 3 cannot be O? Because from ""stole"" feedback, O at position 3 was marked as \'-\'? So if O were in position 3 in secret, we should have gotten a ✓ when we guessed it? But we didn\'t? So O cannot be in position 3? \n\nTherefore, ""GLOVE"" has O in position 3, which is not allowed? So this word is not possible? Or we can guess it? Actually, from feedback, we know the secret word cannot have O in position 3? So we don\'t need to guess O in position 3? \n\nBut if we guess ""GLOVE"", we know O position 3 will be \'-\', and V will be tested? But we also have L in position 2? That might be okay.\n\nBut we can do better? Not to test in known wrong position? And also we learn less.\n\nWe want to test new positions for O and L.\n\nFor O, position 1, 2, or 4 are possible? (since 3 is out).\n\nFor L, position 1, 2, or 3 are possible? (since 4 is out).\n\nAlso, the word must end with E.\n\nSo possible word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = E.\n\nLet me list possible positions:\n- O can be in 1, 2, or 4.\n- L can be in 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: O and L might be the same position? No, only if double letter? But generally, different positions.\n\nPossible word: with O in position 1? For example, ""OLIVE""? But V and I? ""OLIVE"": O L I V E\n- Positions: O(1), L(2), I(3), V(4), E(5)\n- Ends with E: yes.\n- Contains O and L.\n- O at position 1: not tried before? So new position.\n- L at position 2: not tried? In ""stole"", L was at position 4, so here we try L at position 2.\n- Also, avoids forbidden letters? Used: O,L,I,V,E. E we know. O and L we know. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,T. I and V are new and not forbidden.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" seems good? But we need to check if it\'s valid.\n\nOLIVE is a valid word.\n\nLet\'s verify positions:\n- O at position 1: not position 3, so okay? \n- L at position 2: not position 4, so okay.\n- I and V: untested letters.\n\nSimilarly, we have E at the end.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""VOMIT""? No E at the end.\n\nOr ""LANCE"" but A and N are forbidden? Not allowed.\n\n""BOILS"" but ends with S and S forbidden.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" seems a strong choice.\n\nBut ""OLIVE"" has I and V.\n\nAnother word: ""MOVEL""? Not a word.\n\n""LOVE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""HOVEL"": H O V E L -> ends with L? Not E? So not.\n\n""OVULE"" not a word, or sciency? O V U L E -> but V, U, L, E? Positions: O(1), V(2), U(3), L(4), E(5)? But L is at position 4? We know L cannot be at position 4? From ""stole"", L at position 4 gave \'-\', so L not at position 4? Therefore, ""OVULE"" would have L at position 4, which is disallowed? So not possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""PIECE"" not containing O or L.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" seems promising.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OLEIC""? Not 5 letters? And C not allowed? \n\nSo I think ""OLIVE"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""OLIVE"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check: \n- In ""stole"", O was at position 3 and got \'-\', meaning O is in the word but not there. Now in ""OLIVE"", O is at position 1, which is new? So might get ✓ or -?\n Similarly, L at position 2, previously was not in that position? It might be correct or misplaced.\n\nAlso, it uses new letters I and V.\n\nSo we\'ll get information on O, L, I, V, and E at end should be ✓? Since we know E is at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""OLIVE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **From ""crane""**: E is in the word and in position 5 (✓). C, R, A, N are not in the word (x).\n- **From ""stole""**: S and T are not in the word (x). O is in the word but not in position 3 (-). L is in the word but not in position 4 (-). E is in position 5 (✓).\n\n### Current Constraints:\n- The word **ends with E**.\n- **O** must be in the word but **not in position 3**.\n- **L** must be in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, T (not in the word at all).\n- **Available positions** for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since it can\'t be at position 3).\n- **Available positions** for L: 1, 2, or 3 (since it can\'t be at position 4).\n- Must be a 5-letter English word with E at the end.\n\n### Strategy for This Guess:\n- Prioritize placing **O and L in new positions** (O not in position 3, L not in position 4) to test their correct locations.\n- Use **new, common consonants/vowels** from the allowed set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y) to maximize information.\n- A strong candidate is **""OLIVE""**:\n  - Ends with **E** (position 5), leveraging the known correct placement.\n  - Places **O at position 1** (new position, avoiding position 3).\n  - Places **L at position 2** (new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - Tests new letters **I and V**.\n  - Avoids all forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, S, T are absent).\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm the placement of **O and L** (✓ if positions 1/2 are correct, - if misplaced).\n- Test **I and V** (✓/-/x), eliminating more possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>olive</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(-) L(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: olive -> FEEDBACK: O(-) L(-) I(x) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: x → not in word
- R: x → not in word
- A: x → not in word
- N: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → correct and in position 5

**Guess 2: stole**
- S: x → not in word
- T: x → not in word
- O: - → in word but wrong position (not position 3)
- L: - → in word but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: ✓ → correct and in position 5

**Guess 3: olive**
- O: - → in word but wrong position (not position 1)
- L: - → in word but wrong position (not position 2)
- I: x → not in word
- V: x → not in word
- E: ✓ → correct and in position 5

### What we know:
- **E** is in position 5 (fixed).
- **O** is in the word, but not in positions 1, 3 (tested and wrong in positions 1 and 3). Possible positions: 2 or 4.
- **L** is in the word, but not in positions 2, 4 (tested and wrong in positions 2 and 4). Possible positions: 1 or 3.
- **Forbidden letters (not in word)**: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, V.

### Constraints:
- The word must contain **O**, **L**, **E** and two other letters not from the forbidden set.
- Available letters: letters not yet eliminated (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z).
- **Possible positions**:
  - O: position 2 or 4 (only two options left).
  - L: position 1 or 3.
- The word must end with E: `____E`.

### Deduction:
- Since O cannot be at position 1 or 3, and must be somewhere, it must be at **position 2 or 4**.
- L cannot be at position 2 or 4, so it must be at **position 1 or 3**.
- O and L cannot occupy the same position, so:
  - If L is at 1, O can be at 2 or 4.
  - If L is at 3, O can be at 2 or 4.
- We need to find a word that satisfies these positions, uses the allowed letters, and ends with E.

### Possible words:
We can form words using combinations of L and O positions and new allowed letters.

**Case 1: L at position 1, O at position 2**
- Word structure: `L O _ _ E`.
- We need two letters (positions 3 and 4) from the allowed set (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,W,X,Y,Z). Also, must be a real word.
- Examples: 
  - ""LOBBE"" invalid (not a word).
  - ""LOBE"" is 4 letters → invalid.
  - ""LOBED"" → L O B E D? But ends with D, not E? No, structure requires position 5 to be E.
  - ""LODGE"" → L O D G E? Positions: L(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). This works! D and G are allowed letters? Yes.

**Case 2: L at position 1, O at position 4**
- Word structure: `L _ _ O E`.
- Positions 2 and 3 need letters.
B- Examples: 
  - ""LUBOE"" → invalid?
  - ""LYSOE"" → not a word?
  Hard to find valid words.

**Case 3: L at position 3, O at position 2**
- Word structure: `_ O L _ E`.
- Positions 1 and 4 need letters.
- Examples: 
  - ""FOLE""? Not enough letters → ""DOLCE""? Ends with E? D O L C E → C is not allowed? Forbidden? Yes, C is in forbidden list? We eliminated C in guess 1? Yes.
  - ""MOLE"" is 4 letters → ""POLED""? P O L E D? Ends with D, not E.
  - ""WOLFE"" → W O L F E? Positions: W(1), O(2), L(3), F(4), E(5). Valid? ""Wolfe"" is acceptable? Yes.

**Case 4: L at position 3, O at position 4**
- Word structure: `_ _ L O E`.
- Positions 1 and 2 need letters.
- Examples:
  - ""BALOE"" invalid? Unlikely words: ""VALOE"", ""KELOE"" not real? ""HELOE""? No valid common words.

So, the strongest candidates are:
- ""LODGE"" if we place L at 1 and O at 2? But ""LODGE"" has O at position 2? Yes? And L at position 1? Yes? But we must check if it fits all constraints? 

Wait: In ""LODGE"":
- Position 1: L? We haven't tested L at position 1? So possible if L is at 1.
- Position 2: O? We haven't tested O at position 2? So possible.
- D and G are new letters? And allowed? Yes.

But note: In guess 2 (stole): O was tried at position 3? But here O at position 2 would be fine? And L at position 1? Previously L was tried at position 4? So no conflict.

Similarly, ""WOLFE"": 
- Positions: W(1), O(2), L(3), F(4), E(5). 
- O at position 2? Okay? 
- L at position 3? Okay? Since we know L not at position 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible?  

We need to choose one? Both seem plausible? But note we have more constraints? Also, we must avoid I and V? Which both do? 

Let's see which one to test? We want to maximize information? But both test two new letters? 

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one? Or think if ""LODGE"" fits? 

But note: in ""LODGE"", O at position 2: this position was not tested before? Previously O was tried at position 1 and 3? Not 2? So we don't know? Similarly L at position 1: not tried? So we might get ✓ or -? 

Similarly for ""WOLFE"".

However, we need to consider that if we guess ""LODGE"", we are potentially solving? But let's list all possible words? Could there be others? 

Another common word: ""WHOLE"" but O at position 3? Which we know is wrong? So not possible? 

Or ""BOLE"" too short? 

So likely candidates: ""LODGE"" or ""WOLFE"".

But ""WOLFE"" might be considered a proper name? But Wordle usually allows it? 

To decide: we can test ""Lodge""? But let's see the letters? 

We could guess ""LODGE""? 

But wait: in ""olive"", we tried O at position 1? And got '-' meaning O is not at position 1? But in ""LODGE"", O at position 2? That might be correct? 

Similarly, if ""LODGE"" is the word, we get L at position 1: how was L tested? Previously tried at positions 2 and 4? Position 1 was not tried? So possible? 

Now for ""WOLFE"": L at position 3? Previously tried positions 2 and 4? Position 3 not tried? So also possible? 

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we know? Plus two new? 

We don't know? It could have more letters? But in the feedback, we know: E, O, L are present? And from forbidden letters, no others? That means for the secret word, only exactly O, L, E and two other letters? Not necessarily? It could have more of these letters? But we don't have information? 

For example, could the word have two O's? 

In our feedback, we never guessed two O's? So we don't know? But for now, we assume one O and one L? Since no feedback indicates otherwise? 

Therefore, let's try ""LODGE"" because it uses D and G? Common letters? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests a different position? But we need to find the word? 

Since O must be at position 2 or 4, and L at position 1 or 3, let's try to find which one is correct? By testing a word that fixes one? 

For example, if we guess ""LODGE"" with L at 1 and O at 2? If L is actually at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for L? And O at 2? ✓? And D and G? 

Similarly for ""WOLFE"". 

But ""LODGE"" might give us the solution? 

However, let's consider: what if both positions are possible? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that helps distinguish? For example, we try L at position 1? Then see the feedback? 

But we don't have many guesses? So we need to choose efficiently? 

Perhaps there is a word that tests both possibilities? But let's see? 

Another word: ""GLOBE"" but O at position 3? We know impossible? So not? 

Actually, the only words I can think of are ""LODGE"", ""WOLFE"". Perhaps ""BLOKE"" but O? Position? ""BLOKE"": B L O K E? Positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But L at position 2? But we tried L at position 2 in ""olive""? And got feedback L not in position 2? Because in ""olive"" feedback: L at position 2 got '-', meaning not at position 2! So L cannot be at position 2? 

Therefore, ""BLOKE"" has L at position 2? Which is forbidden? Because we know L not at 2? So not possible? 

Similarly, any word with L at position 2 is invalid? Because in guess 3, we tested L at position 2? Got '-' meaning not at 2?  

Similarly, O not at position 1? From ""olive""? 

Therefore, remaining possibilities:

- L at position 1 or 3? 
- O at position 2 or 4? 

So possible positions:
1. L at 1, O at 2 → e.g., ""LODGE""
2. L at 1, O at 4 → e.g., ""L_U_O E""? Like ""LUCRE""? But R forbidden. ""LUDGE""? L U D G E? But U,D,G? Positions: L(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), O? No O? Must have O? 
   Wait: ""LUDGE"" is L U D G E? But no O? So? 
   We need a word with O? So for ""L O _ _ E"" with L at 1 and O at 2? Or ""L _ _ O E"" with L at 1 and O at 4? 
3. L at 3, O at 2 → ""WOLFE"": W O L F E
4. L at 3, O at 4 → ""?? L O E""? Positions: ?(1), ?(2), L(3), O(4), E(5). Example: ""FILEO""? Not valid? ""DOULE""? Not common? ""CYCLE""? C forbidden? ""BYLAW"" no E? ""YCLOE"" not word? There are few words? 

Therefore, the main candidates are:
- ""LODGE"" (L at 1, O at 2, D and G new)
- ""WOLFE"" (W O L F E: L at 3, O at 2, W and F new)
- ""MODEL"" but ends with L? No? Or ""HOLED"" ends with D? 

Perhaps ""LUPON""? No E? 

So ""LODGE"" and ""WOLFE"" are the best options? 

We can guess one? Let's choose ""WOLFE"" because it tests O at position 2? Which we haven't tested? And L at position 3? New? 

In ""LODGE"", O at position 2? But position 2 was never tested? However, we guessed O at positions 1 and 3? Not 2? So both ""LODGE"" and ""WOLFE"" test O at position 2? 

In ""WOLFE"", O is at position 2? In ""LODGE"", O also at position 2? So both have O at position 2? 

Then L at different? 

In ""LODGE"", L at position 1? In ""WOLFE"", L at position 3? 

So we need to determine which one? 

But we have only two possibilities? If ""LODGE"" is wrong, we try ""WOLFE""? Or vice versa? 

To be efficient? We can guess a word that includes many possibilities? But note? We have 3 more guesses? So okay? 

Since ""LODGE"" uses D and G, which are common? We can try ""LODGE"" first? 

But check if ""LODGE"" is valid? Yes? 

Similarly, ""wolfe"" might be less common? 

Another thing: in ""olive"", we tested O at position 1 and L at position 2? Got - for both? 

Now in ""LODGE"": put O at position 2? And L at position 1? 

If ""LODGE"" is correct, then for L: at position 1? We never tried before? So get ✓? For O: at position 2? Never tried? So ✓? 

Similarly for ""WOLFE"": O at position 2 ✓, L at position 3? New? And W and F? 

I think ""LODGE"" is a more common word? 

So I will guess ""LODGE"". 

But to confirm: forbidden letters: not C,R,A,N,S,T,I,V? So D and G are allowed? 

Yes? 

Therefore, guess ""LODGE"". 

But let's see if ""LODGE"" fits all? 
- Positions: L(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).
- L at position 1: not tested before? So possible? 
- O at position 2: not tested? 
- D and G new? 
- Not contain I or V? Yes? 

So why not? 

Alternatively, we could guess ""MODEL""? No? 

So I think ""LODGE"". 

But in the feedback for ""stole"", L was tried at position 4? Wrong? But in ""LODGE"", L is at position 1? So okay? 

Therefore, I guess ""LODGE"".

But wait: what if the word is ""WOMEN""? But no L? 

No, we must have L? From feedback? 

So only alternatives are above? 

Another possibility: O at position 4? Words? 
With L at position 1: ""LUBOE""? Not valid? 
Or L at position 3: ""BLUOSE""? Not? 

So rare? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""LODGE"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **E** is confirmed at position 5 (✓).
- **O** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tested in ""olive"" and ""stole"").
- **L** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (tested in ""olive"" and ""stole"").
- **Forbidden letters (absent)**: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, V.
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - O: position 2 or 4.
  - L: position 1 or 3.
- The word must include two additional unknown letters from the allowed set (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z).

### Deduction:
- With L restricted to position 1 or 3 and O to position 2 or 4, the most plausible word structures are:
  - `L O _ _ E` (L at position 1, O at position 2) → e.g., **LODGE**.
  - `_ O L _ E` (L at position 3, O at position 2) → e.g., **WOLFE** (valid as a surname/common noun).
- **""LODGE"" is prioritized** as it:
  - Uses common consonants (D, G) to maximize information.
  - Tests L at position 1 (new position) and O at position 2 (new position).
  - Avoids all forbidden letters.

If ""LODGE"" is incorrect, the feedback will clarify positions for O/L (✓/-) and reveal if D/G are in the word, narrowing options to ""WOLFE"" or other candidates.

To decide: we can test ""Lodge""? But let's see the letters? 

We could guess ""LODGE""? 

But wait: in ""olive"", we tried O at position 1? And got '-' meaning O is not at position 1? But in ""LODGE"", O at position 2? That might be correct? 

Similarly, if ""LODGE"" is the word, we get L at position 1: how was L tested? Previously tried at positions 2 and 4? Position 1 was not tried? So possible? 

Now for ""WOLFE"": L at position 3? Previously tried positions 2 and 4? Position 3 not tried? So also possible? 

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we know? Plus two new? 

We don't know? It could have more letters? But in the feedback, we know: E, O, L are present? And from forbidden letters, no others? That means for the secret word, only exactly O, L, E and two other letters? Not necessarily? It could have more of these letters? But we don't have information? 

For example, could the word have two O's? 

In our feedback, we never guessed two O's? So we don't know? But for now, we assume one O and one L? Since no feedback indicates otherwise? 

Therefore, let's try ""LODGE"" because it uses D and G? Common letters? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests a different position? But we need to find the word? 

Since O must be at position 2 or 4, and L at position 1 or 3, let's try to find which one is correct? By testing a word that fixes one? 

For example, if we guess ""LODGE"" with L at 1 and O at 2? If L is actually at position 1? Then we might get ✓ for L? And O at 2? ✓? And D and G? 

Similarly for ""WOLFE"". 

But ""LODGE"" might give us the solution? 

However, let's consider: what if both positions are possible? 

Alternatively, we might choose a word that helps distinguish? For example, we try L at position 1? Then see the feedback? 

But we don't have many guesses? So we need to choose efficiently? 

Perhaps there is a word that tests both possibilities? But let's see? 

Another word: ""GLOBE"" but O at position 3? We know impossible? So not? 

Actually, the only words I can think of are ""LODGE"", ""WOLFE"". Perhaps ""BLOKE"" but O? Position? ""BLOKE"": B L O K E? Positions: B(1), L(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But L at position 2? But we tried L at position 2 in ""olive""? And got feedback L not in position 2? Because in ""olive"" feedback: L at position 2 got '-', meaning not at position 2! So L cannot be at position 2? 

Therefore, ""BLOKE"" has L at position 2? Which is forbidden? Because we know L not at 2? So not possible? 

Similarly, any word with L at position 2 is invalid? Because in guess 3, we tested L at position 2? Got '-' meaning not at 2?  

Similarly, O not at position 1? From ""olive""? 

Therefore, remaining possibilities:

- L at position 1 or 3? 
- O at position 2 or 4? 

So possible positions:
1. L at 1, O at 2 → e.g., ""LODGE""
2. L at 1, O at 4 → e.g., ""L_U_O E""? Like ""LUCRE""? But R forbidden. ""LUDGE""? L U D G E? But U,D,G? Positions: L(1), U(2), D(3), G(4), O? No O? Must have O? 
   Wait: ""LUDGE"" is L U D G E? But no O? So? 
   We need a word with O? So for ""L O _ _ E"" with L at 1 and O at 2? Or ""L _ _ O E"" with L at 1 and O at 4? 
3. L at 3, O at 2 → ""WOLFE"": W O L F E
4. L at 3, O at 4 → ""?? L O E""? Positions: ?(1), ?(2), L(3), O(4), E(5). Example: ""FILEO""? Not valid? ""DOULE""? Not common? ""CYCLE""? C forbidden? ""BYLAW"" no E? ""YCLOE"" not word? There are few words? 

Therefore, the main candidates are:
- ""LODGE"" (L at 1, O at 2, D and G new)
- ""WOLFE"" (W O L F E: L at 3, O at 2, W and F new)
- ""MODEL"" but ends with L? No? Or ""HOLED"" ends with D? 

Perhaps ""LUPON""? No E? 

So ""LODGE"" and ""WOLFE"" are the best options? 

We can guess one? Let's choose ""WOLFE"" because it tests O at position 2? Which we haven't tested? And L at position 3? New? 

In ""LODGE"", O at position 2? But position 2 was never tested? However, we guessed O at positions 1 and 3? Not 2? So both ""LODGE"" and ""WOLFE"" test O at position 2? 

In ""WOLFE"", O is at position 2? In ""LODGE"", O also at position 2? So both have O at position 2? 

Then L at different? 

In ""LODGE"", L at position 1? In ""WOLFE"", L at position 3? 

So we need to determine which one? 

But we have only two possibilities? If ""LODGE"" is wrong, we try ""WOLFE""? Or vice versa? 

To be efficient? We can guess a word that includes many possibilities? But note? We have 3 more guesses? So okay? 

Since ""LODGE"" uses D and G, which are common? We can try ""LODGE"" first? 

But check if ""LODGE"" is valid? Yes? 

Similarly, ""wolfe"" might be less common? 

Another thing: in ""olive"", we tested O at position 1 and L at position 2? Got - for both? 

Now in ""LODGE"": put O at position 2? And L at position 1? 

If ""LODGE"" is correct, then for L: at position 1? We never tried before? So get ✓? For O: at position 2? Never tried? So ✓? 

Similarly for ""WOLFE"": O at position 2 ✓, L at position 3? New? And W and F? 

I think ""LODGE"" is a more common word? 

So I will guess ""LODGE"". 

But to confirm: forbidden letters: not C,R,A,N,S,T,I,V? So D and G are allowed? 

Yes? 

Therefore, guess ""LODGE"". 

But let's see if ""LODGE"" fits all? 
- Positions: L(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).
- L at position 1: not tested before? So possible? 
- O at position 2: not tested? 
- D and G new? 
- Not contain I or V? Yes? 

So why not? 

Alternatively, we could guess ""MODEL""? No? 

So I think ""LODGE"". 

But in the feedback for ""stole"", L was tried at position 4? Wrong? But in ""LODGE"", L is at position 1? So okay? 

Therefore, I guess ""LODGE"".

But wait: what if the word is ""WOMEN""? But no L? 

No, we must have L? From feedback? 

So only alternatives are above? 

Another possibility: O at position 4? Words? 
With L at position 1: ""LUBOE""? Not valid? 
Or L at position 3: ""BLUOSE""? Not? 

So rare? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""LODGE"".Based on the previous feedback:

- **E** is confirmed at position 5 (✓).
- **O** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (tested in ""olive"" and ""stole"").
- **L** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (tested in ""olive"" and ""stole"").
- **Forbidden letters (absent)**: C, R, A, N, S, T, I, V.
- **Remaining possible positions**:
  - O: position 2 or 4.
  - L: position 1 or 3.
- The word must include two additional unknown letters from the allowed set (B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, X, Y, Z).

### Deduction:
- With L restricted to position 1 or 3 and O to position 2 or 4, the most plausible word structures are:
  - `L O _ _ E` (L at position 1, O at position 2) → e.g., **LODGE**.
  - `_ O L _ E` (L at position 3, O at position 2) → e.g., **WOLFE** (valid as a surname/common noun).
- **""LODGE"" is prioritized** as it:
  - Uses common consonants (D, G) to maximize information.
  - Tests L at position 1 (new position) and O at position 2 (new position).
  - Avoids all forbidden letters.

If ""LODGE"" is incorrect, the feedback will clarify positions for O/L (✓/-) and reveal if D/G are in the word, narrowing options to ""WOLFE"" or other candidates.",Guess 4: lodge -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) O(✓) D(✓) G(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
