We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I will choose a word that has common letters and no duplicates: ""CRANE""

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
 This means:
 - C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - A, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 Since C and R are not in the word, we should avoid using them in future guesses.

 The secret word contains A, N, E, but not in the positions we guessed.
 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  C (1st) -> not in word
  R (2nd) -> not in word
  A (3rd) -> in word, but not at 3rd
  N (4th) -> in word, but not at 4th
  E (5th) -> in word, but not at 5th

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, we must include them in our next guess.
 Also, we need to choose two new letters to fill the other positions, but avoid C and R.

 We also know the secret word does not have C and R, so we can choose other common letters.

 Since A is not in the 3rd position, N not in 4th, and E not in 5th, we should try placing them in different positions.

 Let's think about common 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (avoiding C and R).

 Possible new letters: try using other common consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

 We should avoid using any letter that might have been ruled out, but only C and R are ruled out so far.

 We also have three positions that are potentially open: the first, second, and third? Actually, the word has five positions.

 Constraints for the secret word:
 - Must contain A, N, E (each exactly once? not necessarily, but we don't know duplicates. However, in the feedback we see each marked separately and ""crane"" has no duplicates, so the secret word could have duplicates? But the feedback for ""crane"" showed A, N, E as present (though wrong position) and no indication of duplicates. Since each letter in the guess is checked independently, if the word had two As, then if we guess one A it would show as present only once? Actually, Wordle rules: each instance is evaluated independently based on frequency. But since ""crane"" has distinct letters, the feedback tells us that the word has at least one A, one N, one E.

 Since the feedback shows each letter independently, and A, N, E are present but not in those positions, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 Also, the secret word does not have C and R at all.

 Now, for our next guess, we need:
 - Must include A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).
 - We should place A, N, E in different positions than in ""crane"". Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at 4, E cannot be at 5.

 Let's consider common words that fit:

 Possibilities: 
 We can try putting A at the beginning? Or end? But E cannot be at the end? Actually, E cannot be at position 5 because in ""crane"" it was at 5th and feedback said wrong position. Similarly for others.

 We also know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We can try a word like ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters. So we need 5.

 How about ""SANE""? That's 4. We need 5.

 Longer: ""PLANE"" -> but P and L are new, and note: we have to avoid C and R, but P and L are okay? Also, we must place A, N, E in different positions.

 In ""PLANE"":
 - P (1st)
 - L (2nd)
 - A (3rd) -> but from previous feedback, A cannot be at position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3rd and marked wrong position? Actually, that doesn't necessarily mean A cannot be at 3rd. Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it could be that the word has an A elsewhere, but we don't know if there is another A? But the rule in Wordle: the feedback tells us the minimal frequency. Actually, the secret word might have one or two As? But we don't know. We should assume it has exactly one A unless we see evidence otherwise? However, we must be cautious.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that at position 3, A is not correct. It doesn't preclude that A might be in the word at position 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback system: 
 - We guessed A at position 3, and the feedback says '-', meaning A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. Therefore, the word has an A somewhere else, and we must not put A at the 3rd position again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste? Since we know it's not there, we shouldn't put it there again? No: actually, if we put A again at position 3, we get the same feedback: '-' meaning it's still not correct. But we already know that. So to gain new information, we should put A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know:
 - A is not at position 3 -> so try A at positions 1,2,4,5?
 - N is not at position 4 -> try at 1,2,3,5?
 - E is not at position 5 -> try at 1,2,3,4?

 Now, we need a word that includes A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and that places:
 - A in a position that is not 3
 - N in a position that is not 4
 - E in a position that is not 5

 Also, we must avoid putting A, N, E in the positions they were previously? Not necessarily, but we want new information.

 Let's think of common five-letter words that fit. Some ideas:

 Option 1: ""LATEN"" - but that's not a word? Let me check: not standard. We need a valid English word.

 Option 2: ""ADIEU"" - but we need N? We must include A, N, E.

 Option 3: ""SALET"" - not including N and E? We need A, N, E.

 Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? 
 - S: 1st
 - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.
 - D: 3rd -> new letter
 - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.
 - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn't prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don't know yet.

 So ""SEDAN"": 
   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)
   This satisfies:
     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.
     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.
     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.

 Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.

 We don't know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).

 Let me check if ""SEDAN"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning a type of car.

 Alternatively, another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but that has A at 1st, then N at 2nd, V, I, L? But what about E? We need E.

 We must have E? Because the previous feedback said E is in the word.

 So we need a word containing A, N, E.

 Another possibility: ""LEANT""? 
   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.

 Another: ""WANED""? 
   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).
   This satisfies:
     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.
     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.
     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.

 ""WANED"" is a valid word.

 But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.

 Let me list some other words: 
   ""EATEN"": 
      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don't know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn't say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.

 So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: 
   First letter: E -> okay? 
   Second letter: A -> okay? 
   Third letter: T -> new
   Fourth letter: E -> we don't know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we can try.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.

 But let me compare: 
   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""

 I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).

 How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven't used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: 
   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.

 Alternatively, ""LANES""?
   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.
   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)
   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)
   S (5)

 So ""LANES"": 
   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).

 Also, introduces L and S.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has L and S? But that's fine.

 ""LANES"" is a valid English word.

 How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.

 Let me look at frequency of letters: 
   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? 

 But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.

 I think I'll go with ""LANES"" because it tests more common letters? Or ""SEDAN""? Actually, let me pick one.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that places E at the start? But let me avoid.

 After thinking, I choose ""LANES"":

 Reason: 
 - It uses L and S, which are common.
 - It moves A, N, E to entirely new positions: A from 3 to 2, N from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4.

 But note: position 3 and 4 were previously occupied by A and N? Now we are putting N at 3 and E at 4? That's okay? Because we are testing new letters at those positions.

 However, note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we assume one of each? Since ""crane"" had distinct and the feedback didn't show duplicates? We cannot assume? But unless we see duplicate feedback, we might guess without duplicates? To avoid complexity.

 Also, we must avoid C and R? So ""LANES"" does not contain C or R? Correct.

 I'll go with ""LANES"".

<guess>lanes</guess>

But wait, there's another option: what about ""STANE""? Not a word? 

""ADEN"" is 4 letters? So no.

I think ""lanes"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""NEARS""? But R is ruled out? So we cannot use R. So avoid.

Also, ""EARNS""? has R and E? But R is ruled out? Cannot use R.

Therefore, ""lanes"" seems safe.

So my guess is ""LANES"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and R are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- A, N, and E are **present** but in the **wrong positions** (marked ""-"" for positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Constraints for New Guess:**  
   - Must contain **A, N, E** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Must **avoid C and R** (confirmed absent).  
   - A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.  
   - Aim to place A, N, and E in **new positions** to gain more information and avoid wasting guesses.  

2. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - Introduce new common letters (**L and S**) to test more characters since they are frequent in English 5-letter words and not yet ruled out.  

3. **Word Choice:**  
   - Considered words like **""SEDAN""** and **""WANED""**, but **""LANES""** fits best:  
     - Positions: L(1), **A(2)**, **N(3)**, **E(4)**, S(5) → avoids banned positions for A (not 3), N (not 4), E (not 5).  
     - New letters tested: L and S.  
     - Valid English word (meaning: narrow roads or pathways).  

4. **Goal:**  
   - Maximize information about the secret word by shifting positions of A, N, E and testing new consonants.

 This means:
 - C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - A, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 Since C and R are not in the word, we should avoid using them in future guesses.

 The secret word contains A, N, E, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, we must include them in our next guess.
 Also, we need to choose two new letters to fill the other positions, but avoid C and R.

 We also know the secret word does not have C and R, so we can choose other common letters.

 Since A is not in the 3rd position, N not in 4th, and E not in 5th, we should try placing them in different positions.

 Let's think about common 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (avoiding C and R).

 Now, for our next guess, we need:
 - Must include A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).
 - We should place A, N, E in different positions than in ""crane"". Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at 4, E cannot be at 5.

 Let's consider common words that fit:

 Possibilities:

 We also know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We can try a word like ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters. So we need 5.

So to gain new information, we should put A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know:
 - A is not at position 3 -> so try A at positions 1,2,4,5?
 - N is not at position 4 -> try at 1,2,3,5?
 - E is not at position 5 -> try at 1,2,3,4?

 Now, we need a word that includes A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and that places:
 - A in a position that is not 3
 - N in a position that is not 4
 - E in a position that is not 5

 Also, we must avoid putting A, N, E in the positions they were previously? Not necessarily, but we want new information.

 Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? 
 - S: 1st
 - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.
 - D: 3rd -> new letter
 - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.
 - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn't prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don't know yet.

 So ""SEDAN"": 
   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)
   This satisfies:
     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.
     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.
     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.

 Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.

 We don't know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).

 Another possibility: ""LEANT""? 
   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.

 Another: ""WANED""? 
   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).
   This satisfies:
     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.
     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.
     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.

 ""WANED"" is a valid word.

 But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.

 Let me list some other words: 
   ""EATEN"": 
      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don't know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn't say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.

 So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: 
   First letter: E -> okay? 
   Second letter: A -> okay? 
   Third letter: T -> new
   Fourth letter: E -> we don't know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we can try.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.

 But let me compare: 
   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""

 I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).

 How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven't used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: 
   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.

 Alternatively, ""LANES""?
   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.
   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)
   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)
   S (5)

 So ""LANES"": 
   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).

 Also, introduces L and S.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has L and S? But that's fine.

 ""LANES"" is a valid English word.

 How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.

 Let me look at frequency of letters: 
   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? 

 But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.

 I think I'll go with ""LANES"" because it tests more common letters? Or ""SEDAN""? Actually, let me pick one.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that places E at the start? But let me avoid.

 After thinking, I choose ""LANES"":

 Reason: 
 - It uses L and S, which are common.
 - It moves A, N, E to entirely new positions: A from 3 to 2, N from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4.

 But note: position 3 and 4 were previously occupied by A and N? Now we are putting N at 3 and E at 4? That's okay? Because we are testing new letters at those positions.

 However, note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we assume one of each? Since ""crane"" had distinct and the feedback didn't show duplicates? We cannot assume? But unless we see duplicate feedback, we might guess without duplicates? To avoid complexity.

 Also, we must avoid C and R? So ""LANES"" does not contain C or R? Correct.

 I'll go with ""LANES"".

<guess>lanes</guess>

But wait, there's another option: what about ""STANE""? Not a word? 

""ADEN"" is 4 letters? So no.

I think ""lanes"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""NEARS""? But R is ruled out? So we cannot use R. So avoid.

Also, ""EARNS""? has R and E? But R is ruled out? Cannot use R.

Therefore, ""lanes"" seems safe.

So my guess is ""LANES"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and R are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- A, N, and E are **present** but in the **wrong positions** (marked ""-"" for positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Constraints for New Guess:**  
   - Must contain **A, N, E** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Must **avoid C and R** (confirmed absent).  
   - A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.  
   - Aim to place A, N, and E in **new positions** to gain more information and avoid wasting guesses.  

2. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - Introduce new common letters (**L and S**) to test more characters since they are frequent in English 5-letter words and not yet ruled out.  

3. **Word Choice:**  
   - Considered words like **""SEDAN""** and **""WANED""**, but **""LANES""** fits best:  
     - Positions: L(1), **A(2)**, **N(3)**, **E(4)**, S(5) → avoids banned positions for A (not 3), N (not 4), E (not 5).  
     - New letters tested: L and S.  
     - Valid English word (meaning: narrow roads or pathways).  

4. **Goal:**

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I will choose a word that has common letters and no duplicates: ""CRANE""

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
 This means:
 - C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - A, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 Since C and R are not in the word, we should avoid using them in future guesses.

 The secret word contains A, N, E, but not in the positions we guessed.
 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  C (1st) -> not in word
  R (2nd) -> not in word
  A (3rd) -> in word, but not at 3rd
  N (4th) -> in word, but not at 4th
  E (5th) -> in word, but not at 5th

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, we must include them in our next guess.
 Also, we need to choose two new letters to fill the other positions, but avoid C and R.

 We also know the secret word does not have C and R, so we can choose other common letters.

 Since A is not in the 3rd position, N not in 4th, and E not in 5th, we should try placing them in different positions.

 Let's think about common 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (avoiding C and R).

 Possible new letters: try using other common consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

 We should avoid using any letter that might have been ruled out, but only C and R are ruled out so far.

 We also have three positions that are potentially open: the first, second, and third? Actually, the word has five positions.

 Constraints for the secret word:
 - Must contain A, N, E (each exactly once? not necessarily, but we don't know duplicates. However, in the feedback we see each marked separately and ""crane"" has no duplicates, so the secret word could have duplicates? But the feedback for ""crane"" showed A, N, E as present (though wrong position) and no indication of duplicates. Since each letter in the guess is checked independently, if the word had two As, then if we guess one A it would show as present only once? Actually, Wordle rules: each instance is evaluated independently based on frequency. But since ""crane"" has distinct letters, the feedback tells us that the word has at least one A, one N, one E.

 Since the feedback shows each letter independently, and A, N, E are present but not in those positions, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 Also, the secret word does not have C and R at all.

 Now, for our next guess, we need:
 - Must include A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).
 - We should place A, N, E in different positions than in ""crane"". Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at 4, E cannot be at 5.

 Let's consider common words that fit:

 Possibilities: 
 We can try putting A at the beginning? Or end? But E cannot be at the end? Actually, E cannot be at position 5 because in ""crane"" it was at 5th and feedback said wrong position. Similarly for others.

 We also know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We can try a word like ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters. So we need 5.

 How about ""SANE""? That's 4. We need 5.

 Longer: ""PLANE"" -> but P and L are new, and note: we have to avoid C and R, but P and L are okay? Also, we must place A, N, E in different positions.

 In ""PLANE"":
 - P (1st)
 - L (2nd)
 - A (3rd) -> but from previous feedback, A cannot be at position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3rd and marked wrong position? Actually, that doesn't necessarily mean A cannot be at 3rd. Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it could be that the word has an A elsewhere, but we don't know if there is another A? But the rule in Wordle: the feedback tells us the minimal frequency. Actually, the secret word might have one or two As? But we don't know. We should assume it has exactly one A unless we see evidence otherwise? However, we must be cautious.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that at position 3, A is not correct. It doesn't preclude that A might be in the word at position 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback system: 
 - We guessed A at position 3, and the feedback says '-', meaning A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. Therefore, the word has an A somewhere else, and we must not put A at the 3rd position again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste? Since we know it's not there, we shouldn't put it there again? No: actually, if we put A again at position 3, we get the same feedback: '-' meaning it's still not correct. But we already know that. So to gain new information, we should put A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know:
 - A is not at position 3 -> so try A at positions 1,2,4,5?
 - N is not at position 4 -> try at 1,2,3,5?
 - E is not at position 5 -> try at 1,2,3,4?

 Now, we need a word that includes A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and that places:
 - A in a position that is not 3
 - N in a position that is not 4
 - E in a position that is not 5

 Also, we must avoid putting A, N, E in the positions they were previously? Not necessarily, but we want new information.

 Let's think of common five-letter words that fit. Some ideas:

 Option 1: ""LATEN"" - but that's not a word? Let me check: not standard. We need a valid English word.

 Option 2: ""ADIEU"" - but we need N? We must include A, N, E.

 Option 3: ""SALET"" - not including N and E? We need A, N, E.

 Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? 
 - S: 1st
 - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.
 - D: 3rd -> new letter
 - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.
 - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn't prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don't know yet.

 So ""SEDAN"": 
   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)
   This satisfies:
     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.
     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.
     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.

 Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.

 We don't know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).

 Let me check if ""SEDAN"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning a type of car.

 Alternatively, another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but that has A at 1st, then N at 2nd, V, I, L? But what about E? We need E.

 We must have E? Because the previous feedback said E is in the word.

 So we need a word containing A, N, E.

 Another possibility: ""LEANT""? 
   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.

 Another: ""WANED""? 
   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).
   This satisfies:
     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.
     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.
     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.

 ""WANED"" is a valid word.

 But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.

 Let me list some other words: 
   ""EATEN"": 
      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don't know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn't say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.

 So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: 
   First letter: E -> okay? 
   Second letter: A -> okay? 
   Third letter: T -> new
   Fourth letter: E -> we don't know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we can try.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.

 But let me compare: 
   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""

 I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).

 How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven't used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: 
   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.

 Alternatively, ""LANES""?
   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.
   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)
   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)
   S (5)

 So ""LANES"": 
   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).

 Also, introduces L and S.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has L and S? But that's fine.

 ""LANES"" is a valid English word.

 How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.

 Let me look at frequency of letters: 
   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? 

 But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.

We need A, N, E.\n\n Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? \n - S: 1st\n - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.\n - D: 3rd -> new letter\n - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.\n - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn\'t prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don\'t know yet.\n\n So ""SEDAN"": \n   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)\n   This satisfies:\n     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.\n     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.\n     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.\n\n Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.\n\n We don\'t know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).\n\n Let me check if ""SEDAN"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning a type of car.\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but that has A at 1st, then N at 2nd, V, I, L? But what about E? We need E.\n\n We must have E? Because the previous feedback said E is in the word.\n\n So we need a word containing A, N, E.\n\n Another possibility: ""LEANT""? \n   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.\n\n Another: ""WANED""? \n   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).\n   This satisfies:\n     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.\n     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.\n     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.\n\n ""WANED"" is a valid word.\n\n But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.\n\n Let me list some other words: \n   ""EATEN"": \n      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E\'s? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don\'t know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn\'t say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.\n\n So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: \n   First letter: E -> okay? \n   Second letter: A -> okay? \n   Third letter: T -> new\n   Fourth letter: E -> we don\'t know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? So we can try.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.\n\n But let me compare: \n   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""\n\n I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).\n\n How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven\'t used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: \n   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.\n\n Alternatively, ""LANES""?\n   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.\n   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)\n   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)\n   S (5)\n\n So ""LANES"": \n   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).\n\n Also, introduces L and S.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has L and S? But that\'s fine.\n\n ""LANES"" is a valid English word.\n\n How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.\n\n Let me look at frequency of letters: \n   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? \n\n But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""LANES"" because it tests more common letters? Or ""SEDAN""? Actually, let me pick one.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that places E at the start? But let me avoid.\n\n After thinking, I choose ""LANES"":\n\n Reason: \n - It uses L and S, which are common.\n - It moves A, N, E to entirely new positions: A from 3 to 2, N from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4.\n\n But note: position 3 and 4 were previously occupied by A and N? Now we are putting N at 3 and E at 4? That\'s okay? Because we are testing new letters at those positions.\n\n However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we assume one of each? Since ""crane"" had distinct and the feedback didn\'t show duplicates? We cannot assume? But unless we see duplicate feedback, we might guess without duplicates? To avoid complexity.\n\n Also, we must avoid C and R? So ""LANES"" does not contain C or R? Correct.\n\n I\'ll go with ""LANES"".\n\n<guess>lanes</guess>\n\nBut wait, there\'s another option: what about ""STANE""? Not a word? \n\n""ADEN"" is 4 letters? So no.\n\nI think ""lanes"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""NEARS""? But R is ruled out? So we cannot use R. So avoid.\n\nAlso, ""EARNS""? has R and E? But R is ruled out? Cannot use R.\n\nTherefore, ""lanes"" seems safe.\n\nSo my guess is ""LANES"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and R are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- A, N, and E are **present** but in the **wrong positions** (marked ""-"" for positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  \n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Constraints for New Guess:**  \n   - Must contain **A, N, E** (since they are confirmed present).  \n   - Must **avoid C and R** (confirmed absent).  \n   - A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.  \n   - Aim to place A, N, and E in **new positions** to gain more information and avoid wasting guesses.  \n\n2. **Selecting New Letters:**  \n   - Introduce new common letters (**L and S**) to test more characters since they are frequent in English 5-letter words and not yet ruled out.  \n\n3. **Word Choice:**  \n   - Considered words like **""SEDAN""** and **""WANED""**, but **""LANES""** fits best:  \n     - Positions: L(1), **A(2)**, **N(3)**, **E(4)**, S(5) → avoids banned positions for A (not 3), N (not 4), E (not 5).  \n     - New letters tested: L and S.  \n     - Valid English word (meaning: narrow roads or pathways).  \n\n4. **Goal:**  \n   - Maximize information about the secret word by shifting positions of A, N, E and testing new consonants.\n\n<guess>lanes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: lanes -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
   - This means: C and R are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 3, 4, and 5 (as guessed).
2. For ""lanes"": L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)
   - This means: L and S are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 2, 3, and 4.

 Now, combining the information:
 - The secret word must contain A, N, E (from both feedbacks).
 - The letters C, R, L, S are absent (both have 'x' in their feedback).
 - Known position constraints:
   For A: Not in position 3 (from guess1) and not in position 2 (from guess2) → so A cannot be in position 2 or 3. 
   For N: Not in position 4 (from guess1) and not 3 (from guess2) → so N cannot be in position 3 or 4.
   For E: Not in position 5 (from guess1) and not 4 (from guess2) → so E cannot be in position 4 or 5.

 Also, note that these letters must be placed in valid positions. We have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 Let's list possible positions for A, N, E:
   A: Cannot be 2 or 3 → only positions 1, 4, 5 left.
   N: Cannot be 3 or 4 → only positions 1, 2, 5 left.
   E: Cannot be 4 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, 3 left.

 Moreover, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and must contain two additional letters (since we have A, N, E and two more). We do not know these two letters, but we know they cannot be C, R, L, S.

 We need to choose a word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (which we haven't tested and are not C,R,L,S). We must avoid using letters that we already know are absent.

 Since we have tried C,R,L,S (and they are absent), we should try other common consonants or vowels.

 The remaining letters: we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to consider the positions.

 Now, note that in the secret word, one of A, N, E might be duplicated? But the feedback from ""crane"" and ""lanes"" showed each of these once per word. Since we haven't seen duplicates yet, we assume each is at least one, but we should not assume exactly one? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates until we guess duplicates? We don't know. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

 How to structure the next word?
 We have three known letters: A, N, E. We need two more letters.

 Also, the positions are constrained. Let's map the possibilities.

 We need a word where:
   - Position 1: can be A, N, or E? But also, it might be unknown? But the constraints:
        A: can be at 1,4,5
        N: can be at 1,2,5
        E: can be at 1,2,3

   For example, let's consider:
        Position 1: could be A? -> then N and E must fit in their allowed positions.

        If position 1 is A (which is allowed):
            Then for N: allowed positions 2,5 -> but position 2 for N? It's allowed? Yes, since 2 is allowed.
            For E: allowed positions 2 (but then N might be at 2? conflict?), 1 (taken by A), or 3 -> so E could be at 3.

            Example: A(1), then N at 2 and E at 3? -> word: A N E ? ?

            But then we have two positions left? And the word must have only three known letters? Wait, no: we know the word must have A, N, E and two more.

            So a word ""ANVET"" is something? Not a word. Let me think of existing words.

        Alternatively, position 1 is A, then N at 5 and E at 2? -> A ? E ? N -> example ""A?E?N""

 How about position 1 is one of the new letters? Then A, N, E must go in their allowed positions.

 Now, because we have limited tries (6 total), we need to make a guess that tests new letters and potentially fits the constraints.

 Let's list possible words that contain A,N,E and two other letters not C,R,L,S.

 Common words: 
   ""TAKEN"": 
        T, A, K, E, N -> note: includes T and K.
        Positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> but we know A cannot be at 2 (from guess2: lanes had A at 2 -> - meaning wrong position). 
           So this placement of A at 2 is disallowed -> ""TAKEN"" not valid? Because we must not put A at 2.

   ""TAKEN"" is invalid because we are forced to put A at 2? Actually, we could rearrange? But ""TAKEN"" is fixed: the word is T-A-K-E-N.

   Alternatively, ""EARTH"": but E at 1? then A at 2? Then E: position 1 is allowed? Yes. A: position 2 is disallowed? -> problem? Also, R is in the word? R is disallowed? R is absent.

   Let's choose words without disallowed letters and in valid positions.

   How about ""EATEN"":
        E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)
        But duplicate E? And A at 2? Not allowed? Also, N at 5? allowed? But E at 1 is allowed? However, A at 2 is disallowed? So invalid.

   How about ""MANGE"": 
        M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> disallowed? (since A cannot be at 2) -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT"":
        P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
        Constraints: 
           A(2) -> disallowed? and also N(4) -> disallowed? (from first guess: N not at 4) -> so both A and N are in bad positions -> invalid.

 We need words that:
   - Avoid positions: A not in 2 or 3; N not in 3 or 4; E not in 4 or 5.

 Let me try to form:

   Option: A at 1? 
      Then positions: A _ _ _ _
      For N: allowed in 2, 5 -> but if N at 2: then _ A? and then E must be in 1,2,3? position 2 already taken? so no: then E at 3? -> word: A N ? E? -> but then position 4? Cannot put E at 4? because E cannot be at 4? 
      Actually: E cannot be at 4 or 5. So if we have A at 1 and N at 2, then we need E in positions 1,2,3 -> but 1 and 2 taken? Only position 3: so A(1) N(2) E(3) ? ? 
      Then we have two positions left? And the word must have two more letters? And E is already used?

      Example: ""ANVET"" not a word? 
      How about ""ANODE"": but O and D? And E is at 5? E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.

      How about ""ANEWS"": but S is absent? And A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, then W? and S? but S is absent -> invalid.

   Try N at position 1? 
      Then positions: N _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed in positions 1,4,5? but position 1 taken? so A at 4 or 5.
        For E: allowed in 1,2,3? taken? so E at 2 or 3.
        Example: 
          N(1), then E at 2 -> then A at 4? -> word: N E ? A ? 
          Then E at 2: so we have N E _ A _ 
          Now, we need one more letter? Actually two: positions 3 and 5.

          Example: ""NEATO""? Not a word? 
          How about ""NEATH"": 
             N(1), E(2), A(4)? then T(3), H(5) -> but note E is at 2? allowed? 
             Constraints: 
                 A at 4: allowed? Since A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> 4 is allowed? 
                 N at 1: allowed? 
                 E at 2: allowed? 
             But ""NEATH"" is an adjective meaning clean? Not very common? And we should test more common letters? 

        But also, we have T and H? We haven't tested T and H? So that's good.

        Check against our previous guesses? We haven't used T or H? So okay.

        Alternatively: ""NEAT"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

        ""VENAE""? E duplicated? Not good?

   But note: we haven't tested T, H, etc.? So let's consider.

   Another possibility: E at position 1? 
      Then E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed positions 1,4,5 -> 1 taken? so 4 or 5.
        For N: allowed 1,2,5 -> 1 taken? so 2 or 5.
        Example: 
          E(1), then A at position 4 -> and N at position 2 -> E(1) N(2) ? A(4) ? 
          Then we need letter at 3 and 5? And the word must be a word.

          Example: ""END"" is 3? 
          How about ""ENTAD""? Not common? 
          Or ""EPHA""? Obscure?

   Better to use words that are common? 

   With N at 1? we have ""NEATH"" which is acceptable? But not the most common? 

   How about ""NEIGH"": 
        N(1), E(2), I(3?), G(4), H(5)
        Constraints:
          N at 1: allowed? Yes.
          E at 2: allowed? Yes.
          But I(3): no constraint yet? But then A must be in the word? We haven't placed A? So we must include A somewhere? But in ""NEIGH"", there is no A? So not valid? Because the word must have A.

   We must include A? So the word must have A.

   Therefore, in the scenario of N at 1, E at 2, we then must place A at either 4 or 5? And then fill the remaining positions? 

   If A at 4: then the word is N E ? A ? -> and we must put a letter at position 3 and 5? 
   How about N E X A T? Not a word? 

   How about ""NEVAT""? Not a word? 

   Consider A at 5? Then the word is N E ? ? A? and A at 5: which is allowed? 
   Example: ""NEBULA"" -> 6 letters? 

   So then we would have N E _ _ A? 5 letters? Like ""NESTA"" - not a word? 

   Alternatively: if we swap A and N? 

   Another idea: put A at position 1? and then E at position 3? (since E can be at 3) and N at position 5? (allowed? since N can be at 5) 
      Word: A _ E _ N
      Example: ""A?E?N"" -> words: ""ABERN"" not a word? ""AWDEN"" not a word? 

   Alternatively, how about ""AMENS""? But S is absent? Also, positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), S(5)? 
      Constraints:
          A(1): allowed.
          E(3): allowed? because E can be at 3? 
          N(4): but disallowed? because N cannot be at 4? -> so invalid.

   After careful thought, let me try to list words that include A,N,E and don't contain C,R,L,S? And that distribute the letters in their allowed positions.

   One word that comes to mind: ""DAVEN"" (which is to pray) - but positions: 
        D(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5)
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""WANED"" (we thought earlier?): 
        W(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) 
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? - because from guess2? lanes had A at 2 -> it was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at 2? -> invalid.

   Another: ""HAVEN""? Contains H, V? 
        H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) 
        Problems: 
          A(2): disallowed? 
          E(4): disallowed? E cannot be at 4? -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT""? We saw earlier? invalid.

   I am noticing it's tricky? 

   Another common word: ""TENET""? Has duplicates? And no A? But we must have A.

   We must find a word with A.

   Let me try ""DEAN"" + a letter? But 4 letters.

   How about ""DEBAR""? R disallowed? 

   Alternatively: ""OAKEN""? 
        O(1), A(2) -> disallowed? 

   How about ""AEGIS""? But E at 2? then we don't have N? 

   We must have letters: A,N,E in it? 

   Perhaps we try ""TAKEN"" again? But A at 2 not allowed? 

   I think we must try a word with A at 1, or at 4 or 5? 

   Let me put A at 5? 
      Then for N: allowed at 1,2,5? but 5 taken by A? so at 1 or 2?
      For E: allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Example: 
          If we put A at 5, then place N at 2 and E at 3 -> word: ? N E ? A -> so _ N E _ A? 
          How about ""UNN E? A"" -> ""UNSEA"" not a word? 
          ""INTEA"" not a word? 

   Alternatively: A at 4? 
      Then word: _ _ _ A _
      N allowed at 1,2,5? 
      E allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Suppose N at 1? then E at 2? Then: N E ? A ? -> as before? 

   We try:

      ""NEUMA"": 
        N(1), E(2), U(3), M(4), A(5) ? 
        Constraints: 
          A: at position 5? -> allowed? 
          N: at position 1 -> allowed? 
          E: at position 2 -> allowed? 
        Also, U and M are new? 
        And the word ""NEUMA"" is a variant spelling of ""pneuma"" meaning spirit? Not common? 

      How about ""NEAPA"": but not a word.

      How about ""NEALA"" -> not a word? 

   One more: let me try ""AUDIO"" like start? But we need E and no A at positions 2 or 3? 

   This is challenging? 

   After research, I found:

      ""AGONE"": 
        A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> but check constraints:
          N(4): disallowed? -> cannot be at 4? 

      ""ALANE"": L disallowed? 

   Let's try ""ETNA"" not 5 letters? Add B: ""BENAY""? Not common? 

   How about ""MATEY"": no N?

   Maybe ""PANED"": 
        P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> constraints: 
           A(2): disallowed? 
           N(3): disallowed? 
           E(4): disallowed? 
        invalid.

   Why not try a word with duplicate letter? We haven't seen direct evidence against duplicates, though feedback hasn't shown any duplicate yet? 

   How about ""BANED"" (not common, but valid as past tense of ban?) 
        B(1), A(2) -> disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""QUENA""? Not common? 

   Given the complexity, perhaps I should choose a word that tests new letters and places A, N, E in their allowed positions, even if the word might not be high-frequency? 

   I think ""NEUM"" is not 5? 

   Let me think of ""ANE? ... 
   Or let me try putting E at position 1:
        E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: positions 4 or 5.
        For N: positions 2 or 5 (but if A at 5, then N can be at 2? or if A at 4, then N can be at 2 or 5? but 5 then conflict?).

        Example: E(1), then A at 4? -> so E _ _ A _
        Then N can be at 2: E N ? A ? -> so EN and then fourth is A, so need position 3 and 5? 

        How about ""END"" with something? ""ENTAD""?
        Or ""ENTIA"": 
            E(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), A(5) -> 
            Constraints:
              A(5): allowed? 
              N(2): allowed? 
              E(1): allowed? 
            Then word? ""ENTIA"" (plural of ens in philosophy) -> valid? 

        The word would be ""ENTIA"" (also a programming term?)? 

        Check the constraints?
          A: position 5? -> allowed (since not 2 or 3) -> yes.
          N: position 2? -> allowed (not 3 or 4) -> yes.
          E: position 1? -> allowed (not 4 or 5) -> yes.

        Also, the new letters: T and I.

        And no C,R,L,S? 

        So ""ENTIA"" is a rare word? But accepted in some dictionaries? For Wordle, we need common words? But the rules here don't specify? We just need a valid English word.

        However, there's also ""ENZIA""? 

        We must make a guess. Another common word that fits: 

        How about ""DANCE""? but C disallowed.

        Or ""FENCE""? C disallowed? 

        ""MATEY"" doesn't have N.

        After reconsideration, we can try ""OXEYE"" - but no A? 

        I decide to go with ""ENTIA"" (or perhaps ""TENIA""? or ""TIENA"" ... not a word.

        ""TINEA"": 
          T(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5) 
          Constraints:
             N(3): disallowed? (because N cannot be at 3? we have feedback: guess2 ""lanes"" had N at 3 and marked as - (present but wrong position? so it's not here? but could be in 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback for N in guess2 was - at position 3, which means N is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put N at 3 again? Because we know it's not there? So N(3) is disallowed? -> so ""TINEA"" has N at 3 -> invalid.)

        ""TENIA"": 
           T(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)
           Constraints:
              N(3): disallowed? -> invalid.

        ""ANTIC"": C disallowed.

        ""VENAE"": duplicate E?

        So ""ENTIA"": with the spelling E-N-T-I-A. 

        But is ""entia"" common? Not really? But let's see another word.

        Have we missed any common word for this structure? 

        How about ""EXAMS"": has X? then ""EX"" at 1? then but wait: must have N? no.

        Given the time, we choose ""ENTIA"" for now.

        But ideally, we want to test letters that can help constraint more? 

        Notice that in the feedback we have only three known present letters and many absent letters. So we should not guess a rare word? 

        Alternatively: let's try a word that places A at 4, for example, and use common letters.

        Example: A only allowed at 1,4,5? 
        Let me try positions: 
          If A is at 4, then what can be at 1?? We haven't tested many letters? Then we put a new letter at 1? and then put letters? 
          Then positions: _ _ _ A _ 
          E allowed at 1,2,3? 
          N allowed at 1,2,5? 
          If we put E at 1 and A at 4: then E _ _ A _ 
          Then for N: at positions 2,5? 
          Option: 
            E(1), N(2), then we need position 3? then A(4)? and position 5? 
            Word: E N ? A ? 
            Letter at 3 and 5: who? 

          Common words: ""ENTIA"" works? 

        So perhaps ""entia"" is the best we have? 

        But there are other words: ""MEDIA""? but then we have D, and no N? Must have N.

        ""MEDIA"" has M,E,D,I,A? missing N? invalid.

        ""PETAL""? no N.

        I also think of ""KENAF"" (a plant):
          K(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), F(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(2): allowed? -> yes.
             N(3): disallowed? -> no, because guess2: lanes had N at 3 and marked as present but not position 3? so it should be disallowed position 3? -> so N cannot be at 3? -> invalid.

        Similarly, ""BAZAR"" has R? disallowed? 

        Given the difficulty, I will go with ""ENTIA"", with the note that it might be an uncommon word? but will serve our purpose.

        Or: how about ""UNTIE""? 
          U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(5) -> disallowed? -> so this is bad? E cannot be at 5? 

        ""UNITE"": E at 5? -> disallowed.

        Therefore, not.

        I choose ""ENTIA"".

        So our guess is ""ENTIA""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here's a step-by-step deduction:

### Step-by-Step Thoughts:
1. **Absent Letters:**  
   - First guess (""crane"") ruled out **C** and **R**.  
   - Second guess (""lanes"") ruled out **L** and **S**.  
   - Total absent letters: **C, R, L, S**.  
   - These cannot appear in the secret word.

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions):**  
   - Both guesses confirm **A, N, E** are in the secret word, but misplaced:  
     - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""lanes"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
     - **N**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""lanes"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
     - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""lanes"") or 5 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 3.  

3. **Word Construction:**  
   - The next guess must include **A, N, E**, exclude **C/R/L/S**, and respects position constraints.  
   - Explore placing **A, N, E** while introducing 2 new untested letters.  
   - Possible valid positions:  
     - **Option 1:**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - N at position 2 (allowed).  
       - A at position 5 (allowed; not 2 or 3).  
       - Example word: **""ENTIA""** (meaning entities).  
       - **E(1)**, **N(2)**, T(3), I(4), **A(5)** → Valid placement.  
     - **Option 2 (retreat):**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - A at position 4 (allowed).  
       - N at position 5 (allowed).  
       - Example word: **""EX?AN""** → Hard to find common words (e.g., ""EXMAN"" invalid).

4. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - **T** and **I** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  
   - **ENTIA** tests both T and I, placing A/N/E correctly while maximizing new information.

5. **Confirmation:**  
   - No duplicates. Positions satisfy constraints.  
   - New letters: T and I → Potential to reveal critical info if present/absent.

Given the constraints, **""ENTIA""** is a valid guess that adheres to rules and leverages feedback optimally.

<guess>entia</guess>",entia,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
   - This means: C and R are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 3, 4, and 5 (as guessed).
2. For ""lanes"": L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)
   - This means: L and S are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 2, 3, and 4.

 Now, combining the information:
 - The secret word must contain A, N, E (from both feedbacks).
 - The letters C, R, L, S are absent (both have 'x' in their feedback).
 - Known position constraints:
   For A: Not in position 3 (from guess1) and not in position 2 (from guess2) → so A cannot be in position 2 or 3. 
   For N: Not in position 4 (from guess1) and not 3 (from guess2) → so N cannot be in position 3 or 4.
   For E: Not in position 5 (from guess1) and not 4 (from guess2) → so E cannot be in position 4 or 5.

 Also, note that these letters must be placed in valid positions. We have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 Let's list possible positions for A, N, E:
   A: Cannot be 2 or 3 → only positions 1, 4, 5 left.
   N: Cannot be 3 or 4 → only positions 1, 2, 5 left.
   E: Cannot be 4 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, 3 left.

 Moreover, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and must contain two additional letters (since we have A, N, E and two more). We do not know these two letters, but we know they cannot be C, R, L, S.

 We need to choose a word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (which we haven't tested and are not C,R,L,S). We must avoid using letters that we already know are absent.

 Since we have tried C,R,L,S (and they are absent), we should try other common consonants or vowels.

 The remaining letters: we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to consider the positions.

 Now, note that in the secret word, one of A, N, E might be duplicated? But the feedback from ""crane"" and ""lanes"" showed each of these once per word. Since we haven't seen duplicates yet, we assume each is at least one, but we should not assume exactly one? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates until we guess duplicates? We don't know. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

 How to structure the next word?
 We have three known letters: A, N, E. We need two more letters.

 Also, the positions are constrained. Let's map the possibilities.

 We need a word where:
   - Position 1: can be A, N, or E? But also, it might be unknown? But the constraints:
        A: can be at 1,4,5
        N: can be at 1,2,5
        E: can be at 1,2,3

   For example, let's consider:
        Position 1: could be A? -> then N and E must fit in their allowed positions.

        If position 1 is A (which is allowed):
            Then for N: allowed positions 2,5 -> but position 2 for N? It's allowed? Yes, since 2 is allowed.
            For E: allowed positions 2 (but then N might be at 2? conflict?), 1 (taken by A), or 3 -> so E could be at 3.

            Example: A(1), then N at 2 and E at 3? -> word: A N E ? ?

            But then we have two positions left? And the word must have only three known letters? Wait, no: we know the word must have A, N, E and two more.

            So a word ""ANVET"" is something? Not a word. Let me think of existing words.

        Alternatively, position 1 is A, then N at 5 and E at 2? -> A ? E ? N -> example ""A?E?N""

 How about position 1 is one of the new letters? Then A, N, E must go in their allowed positions.

 Now, because we have limited tries (6 total), we need to make a guess that tests new letters and potentially fits the constraints.

 Let's list possible words that contain A,N,E and two other letters not C,R,L,S.

 Common words: 
   ""TAKEN"": 
        T, A, K, E, N -> note: includes T and K.
        Positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> but we know A cannot be at 2 (from guess2: lanes had A at 2 -> - meaning wrong position). 
           So this placement of A at 2 is disallowed -> ""TAKEN"" not valid? Because we must not put A at 2.

   ""TAKEN"" is invalid because we are forced to put A at 2? Actually, we could rearrange? But ""TAKEN"" is fixed: the word is T-A-K-E-N.

   Alternatively, ""EARTH"": but E at 1? then A at 2? Then E: position 1 is allowed? Yes. A: position 2 is disallowed? -> problem? Also, R is in the word? R is disallowed? R is absent.

   Let's choose words without disallowed letters and in valid positions.

   How about ""EATEN"":
        E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)
        But duplicate E? And A at 2? Not allowed? Also, N at 5? allowed? But E at 1 is allowed? However, A at 2 is disallowed? So invalid.

   How about ""MANGE"": 
        M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> disallowed? (since A cannot be at 2) -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT"":
        P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
        Constraints: 
           A(2) -> disallowed? and also N(4) -> disallowed? (from first guess: N not at 4) -> so both A and N are in bad positions -> invalid.

 We need words that:
   - Avoid positions: A not in 2 or 3; N not in 3 or 4; E not in 4 or 5.

 Let me try to form:

   Option: A at 1? 
      Then positions: A _ _ _ _
      For N: allowed in 2, 5 -> but if N at 2: then _ A? and then E must be in 1,2,3? position 2 already taken? so no: then E at 3? -> word: A N ? E? -> but then position 4? Cannot put E at 4? because E cannot be at 4? 
      Actually: E cannot be at 4 or 5. So if we have A at 1 and N at 2, then we need E in positions 1,2,3 -> but 1 and 2 taken? Only position 3: so A(1) N(2) E(3) ? ? 
      Then we have two positions left? And the word must have two more letters? And E is already used?

      Example: ""ANVET"" not a word? 
      How about ""ANODE"": but O and D? And E is at 5? E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.

      How about ""ANEWS"": but S is absent? And A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, then W? and S? but S is absent -> invalid.

   Try N at position 1? 
      Then positions: N _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed in positions 1,4,5? but position 1 taken? so A at 4 or 5.
        For E: allowed in 1,2,3? taken? so E at 2 or 3.
        Example: 
          N(1), then E at 2 -> then A at 4? -> word: N E ? A ? 
          Then E at 2: so we have N E _ A _ 
          Now, we need one more letter? Actually two: positions 3 and 5.

          Example: ""NEATO""? Not a word? 
          How about ""NEATH"": 
             N(1), E(2), A(4)? then T(3), H(5) -> but note E is at 2? allowed? 
             Constraints: 
                 A at 4: allowed? Since A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> 4 is allowed? 
                 N at 1: allowed? 
                 E at 2: allowed? 
             But ""NEATH"" is an adjective meaning clean? Not very common? And we should test more common letters? 

        But also, we have T and H? We haven't tested T and H? So that's good.

        Check against our previous guesses? We haven't used T or H? So okay.

        Alternatively: ""NEAT"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

        ""VENAE""? E duplicated? Not good?

   But note: we haven't tested T, H, etc.? So let's consider.

   Another possibility: E at position 1? 
      Then E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed positions 1,4,5 -> 1 taken? so 4 or 5.
        For N: allowed 1,2,5 -> 1 taken? so 2 or 5.
        Example: 
          E(1), then A at position 4 -> and N at position 2 -> E(1) N(2) ? A(4) ? 
          Then we need letter at 3 and 5? And the word must be a word.

          Example: ""END"" is 3? 
          How about ""ENTAD""? Not common? 
          Or ""EPHA""? Obscure?

   Better to use words that are common? 

   With N at 1? we have ""NEATH"" which is acceptable? But not the most common? 

   How about ""NEIGH"": 
        N(1), E(2), I(3?), G(4), H(5)
        Constraints:
          N at 1: allowed? Yes.
          E at 2: allowed? Yes.
          But I(3): no constraint yet? But then A must be in the word? We haven't placed A? So we must include A somewhere? But in ""NEIGH"", there is no A? So not valid? Because the word must have A.

   We must include A? So the word must have A.

   Therefore, in the scenario of N at 1, E at 2, we then must place A at either 4 or 5? And then fill the remaining positions? 

   If A at 4: then the word is N E ? A ? -> and we must put a letter at position 3 and 5? 
   How about N E X A T? Not a word? 

   How about ""NEVAT""? Not a word? 

   Consider A at 5? Then the word is N E ? ? A? and A at 5: which is allowed? 
   Example: ""NEBULA"" -> 6 letters? 

   So then we would have N E _ _ A? 5 letters? Like ""NESTA"" - not a word? 

   Alternatively: if we swap A and N? 

   Another idea: put A at position 1? and then E at position 3? (since E can be at 3) and N at position 5? (allowed? since N can be at 5) 
      Word: A _ E _ N
      Example: ""A?E?N"" -> words: ""ABERN"" not a word? ""AWDEN"" not a word? 

   Alternatively, how about ""AMENS""? But S is absent? Also, positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), S(5)? 
      Constraints:
          A(1): allowed.
          E(3): allowed? because E can be at 3? 
          N(4): but disallowed? because N cannot be at 4? -> so invalid.

   After careful thought, let me try to list words that include A,N,E and don't contain C,R,L,S? And that distribute the letters in their allowed positions.

   One word that comes to mind: ""DAVEN"" (which is to pray) - but positions: 
        D(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5)
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""WANED"" (we thought earlier?): 
        W(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) 
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? - because from guess2? lanes had A at 2 -> it was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at 2? -> invalid.

   Another: ""HAVEN""? Contains H, V? 
        H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) 
        Problems: 
          A(2): disallowed? 
          E(4): disallowed? E cannot be at 4? -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT""? We saw earlier? invalid.

   I am noticing it's tricky? 

   Another common word: ""TENET""? Has duplicates? And no A? But we must have A.

   We must find a word with A.

   Let me try ""DEAN"" + a letter? But 4 letters.

   How about ""DEBAR""? R disallowed? 

   Alternatively: ""OAKEN""? 
        O(1), A(2) -> disallowed? 

   How about ""AEGIS""? But E at 2? then we don't have N? 

   We must have letters: A,N,E in it? 

   Perhaps we try ""TAKEN"" again? But A at 2 not allowed? 

   I think we must try a word with A at 1, or at 4 or 5? 

   Let me put A at 5? 
      Then for N: allowed at 1,2,5? but 5 taken by A? so at 1 or 2?
      For E: allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Example: 
          If we put A at 5, then place N at 2 and E at 3 -> word: ? N E ? A -> so _ N E _ A? 
          How about ""UNN E? A"" -> ""UNSEA"" not a word? 
          ""INTEA"" not a word? 

   Alternatively: A at 4? 
      Then word: _ _ _ A _
      N allowed at 1,2,5? 
      E allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Suppose N at 1? then E at 2? Then: N E ? A ? -> as before? 

   We try:

      ""NEUMA"": 
        N(1), E(2), U(3), M(4), A(5) ? 
        Constraints: 
          A: at position 5? -> allowed? 
          N: at position 1 -> allowed? 
          E: at position 2 -> allowed? 
        Also, U and M are new? 
        And the word ""NEUMA"" is a variant spelling of ""pneuma"" meaning spirit? Not common? 

      How about ""NEAPA"": but not a word.

      How about ""NEALA"" -> not a word? 

   One more: let me try ""AUDIO"" like start? But we need E and no A at positions 2 or 3? 

   This is challenging? 

   After research, I found:

      ""AGONE"": 
        A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> but check constraints:
          N(4): disallowed? -> cannot be at 4? 

      ""ALANE"": L disallowed? 

   Let's try ""ETNA"" not 5 letters? Add B: ""BENAY""? Not common? 

   How about ""MATEY"": no N?

   Maybe ""PANED"": 
        P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> constraints: 
           A(2): disallowed? 
           N(3): disallowed? 
           E(4): disallowed? 
        invalid.

   Why not try a word with duplicate letter? We haven't seen direct evidence against duplicates, though feedback hasn't shown any duplicate yet? 

   How about ""BANED"" (not common, but valid as past tense of ban?) 
        B(1), A(2) -> disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""QUENA""? Not common? 

   Given the complexity, perhaps I should choose a word that tests new letters and places A, N, E in their allowed positions, even if the word might not be high-frequency? 

   I think ""NEUM"" is not 5? 

   Let me think of ""ANE? ... 
   Or let me try putting E at position 1:
        E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: positions 4 or 5.
        For N: positions 2 or 5 (but if A at 5, then N can be at 2? or if A at 4, then N can be at 2 or 5? but 5 then conflict?).

        Example: E(1), then A at 4? -> so E _ _ A _
        Then N can be at 2: E N ? A ? -> so EN and then fourth is A, so need position 3 and 5? 

        How about ""END"" with something? ""ENTAD""?
        Or ""ENTIA"": 
            E(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), A(5) -> 
            Constraints:
              A(5): allowed? 
              N(2): allowed? 
              E(1): allowed? 
            Then word? ""ENTIA"" (plural of ens in philosophy) -> valid? 

        The word would be ""ENTIA"" (also a programming term?)? 

        Check the constraints?
          A: position 5? -> allowed (since not 2 or 3) -> yes.
          N: position 2? -> allowed (not 3 or 4) -> yes.
          E: position 1? -> allowed (not 4 or 5) -> yes.

        Also, the new letters: T and I.

        And no C,R,L,S? 

        So ""ENTIA"" is a rare word? But accepted in some dictionaries? For Wordle, we need common words? But the rules here don't specify? We just need a valid English word.

        However, there's also ""ENZIA""? 

        We must make a guess. Another common word that fits: 

        How about ""DANCE""? but C disallowed.

        Or ""FENCE""? C disallowed? 

        ""MATEY"" doesn't have N.

        After reconsideration, we can try ""OXEYE"" - but no A? 

        I decide to go with ""ENTIA"" (or perhaps ""TENIA""? or ""TIENA"" ... not a word.

        ""TINEA"": 
          T(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5) 
          Constraints:
             N(3): disallowed? (because N cannot be at 3? we have feedback: guess2 ""lanes"" had N at 3 and marked as - (present but wrong position? so it's not here? but could be in 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback for N in guess2 was - at position 3, which means N is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put N at 3 again? Because we know it's not there? So N(3) is disallowed? -> so ""TINEA"" has N at 3 -> invalid.)

        ""TENIA"": 
           T(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)
           Constraints:
              N(3): disallowed? -> invalid.

        ""ANTIC"": C disallowed.

        ""VENAE"": duplicate E?

        So ""ENTIA"": with the spelling E-N-T-I-A. 

        But is ""entia"" common? Not really? But let's see another word.

        Have we missed any common word for this structure? 

        How about ""EXAMS"": has X? then ""EX"" at 1? then but wait: must have N? no.

        Given the time, we choose ""ENTIA"" for now.

        But ideally, we want to test letters that can help constraint more? 

        Notice that in the feedback we have only three known present letters and many absent letters. So we should not guess a rare word? 

        Alternatively: let's try a word that places A at 4, for example, and use common letters.

        Example: A only allowed at 1,4,5? 
        Let me try positions: 
          If A is at 4, then what can be at 1?? We haven't tested many letters? Then we put a new letter at 1? and then put letters? 
          Then positions: _ _ _ A _ 
          E allowed at 1,2,3? 
          N allowed at 1,2,5? 
          If we put E at 1 and A at 4: then E _ _ A _ 
          Then for N: at positions 2,5? 
          Option: 
            E(1), N(2), then we need position 3? then A(4)? and position 5? 
            Word: E N ? A ? 
            Letter at 3 and 5: who? 

          Common words: ""ENTIA"" works? 

        So perhaps ""entia"" is the best we have? 

        But there are other words: ""MEDIA""? but then we have D, and no N? Must have N.

        ""MEDIA"" has M,E,D,I,A? missing N? invalid.

        ""PETAL""? no N.

        I also think of ""KENAF"" (a plant):
          K(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), F(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(2): allowed? -> yes.
             N(3): disallowed? -> no, because guess2: lanes had N at 3 and marked as present but not position 3? so it should be disallowed position 3? -> so N cannot be at 3? -> invalid.

        Similarly, ""BAZAR"" has R? disallowed? 

        Given the difficulty, I will go with ""ENTIA"", with the note that it might be an uncommon word? but will serve our purpose.

        Or: how about ""UNTIE""? 
          U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(5) -> disallowed? -> so this is bad? E cannot be at 5? 

        ""UNITE"": E at 5? -> disallowed.

        Therefore, not.

        I choose ""ENTIA"".

        So our guess is ""ENTIA""After analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here's a step-by-step deduction:

### Step-by-Step Thoughts:
1. **Absent Letters:**  
   - First guess (""crane"") ruled out **C** and **R**.  
   - Second guess (""lanes"") ruled out **L** and **S**.  
   - Total absent letters: **C, R, L, S**.  
   - These cannot appear in the secret word.

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions):**  
   - Both guesses confirm **A, N, E** are in the secret word, but misplaced:  
     - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""lanes"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
     - **N**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""lanes"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
     - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""lanes"") or 5 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 3.  

3. **Word Construction:**  
   - The next guess must include **A, N, E**, exclude **C/R/L/S**, and respects position constraints.  
   - Explore placing **A, N, E** while introducing 2 new untested letters.  
   - Possible valid positions:  
     - **Option 1:**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - N at position 2 (allowed).  
       - A at position 5 (allowed; not 2 or 3).  
       - Example word: **""ENTIA""** (meaning entities).  
       - **E(1)**, **N(2)**, T(3), I(4), **A(5)** → Valid placement.  
     - **Option 2 (retreat):**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - A at position 4 (allowed).  
       - N at position 5 (allowed).  
       - Example word: **""EX?AN""** → Hard to find common words (e.g., ""EXMAN"" invalid).

4. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - **T** and **I** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  
   - **ENTIA** tests both T and I, placing A/N/E correctly while maximizing new information.

5. **Confirmation:**  
   - No duplicates. Positions satisfy constraints.  
   - New letters: T and I → Potential to reveal critical info if present/absent.

Given the constraints, **""ENTIA""** is a valid guess that adheres to rules and leverages feedback optimally.",Guess 3: entia -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) T(x) I(x) A(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,knead,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I will choose a word that has common letters and no duplicates: ""CRANE""

 Why ""CRANE""?
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
 This means:
 - C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - A, N, and E are in the secret word but in the wrong positions.

 Since C and R are not in the word, we should avoid using them in future guesses.

 The secret word contains A, N, E, but not in the positions we guessed.
 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  C (1st) -> not in word
  R (2nd) -> not in word
  A (3rd) -> in word, but not at 3rd
  N (4th) -> in word, but not at 4th
  E (5th) -> in word, but not at 5th

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, we must include them in our next guess.
 Also, we need to choose two new letters to fill the other positions, but avoid C and R.

 We also know the secret word does not have C and R, so we can choose other common letters.

 Since A is not in the 3rd position, N not in 4th, and E not in 5th, we should try placing them in different positions.

 Let's think about common 5-letter words that contain A, N, E and two other letters (avoiding C and R).

 Possible new letters: try using other common consonants like T, S, L, D, etc.

 We should avoid using any letter that might have been ruled out, but only C and R are ruled out so far.

 We also have three positions that are potentially open: the first, second, and third? Actually, the word has five positions.

 Constraints for the secret word:
 - Must contain A, N, E (each exactly once? not necessarily, but we don't know duplicates. However, in the feedback we see each marked separately and ""crane"" has no duplicates, so the secret word could have duplicates? But the feedback for ""crane"" showed A, N, E as present (though wrong position) and no indication of duplicates. Since each letter in the guess is checked independently, if the word had two As, then if we guess one A it would show as present only once? Actually, Wordle rules: each instance is evaluated independently based on frequency. But since ""crane"" has distinct letters, the feedback tells us that the word has at least one A, one N, one E.

 Since the feedback shows each letter independently, and A, N, E are present but not in those positions, we should include them again, but in different positions.

 Also, the secret word does not have C and R at all.

 Now, for our next guess, we need:
 - Must include A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).
 - We should place A, N, E in different positions than in ""crane"". Specifically, A cannot be at position 3, N cannot be at 4, E cannot be at 5.

 Let's consider common words that fit:

 Possibilities: 
 We can try putting A at the beginning? Or end? But E cannot be at the end? Actually, E cannot be at position 5 because in ""crane"" it was at 5th and feedback said wrong position. Similarly for others.

 We also know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _

 We can try a word like ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters. So we need 5.

 How about ""SANE""? That's 4. We need 5.

 Longer: ""PLANE"" -> but P and L are new, and note: we have to avoid C and R, but P and L are okay? Also, we must place A, N, E in different positions.

 In ""PLANE"":
 - P (1st)
 - L (2nd)
 - A (3rd) -> but from previous feedback, A cannot be at position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3rd and marked wrong position? Actually, that doesn't necessarily mean A cannot be at 3rd. Wait, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it could be that the word has an A elsewhere, but we don't know if there is another A? But the rule in Wordle: the feedback tells us the minimal frequency. Actually, the secret word might have one or two As? But we don't know. We should assume it has exactly one A unless we see evidence otherwise? However, we must be cautious.

 Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that at position 3, A is not correct. It doesn't preclude that A might be in the word at position 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback system: 
 - We guessed A at position 3, and the feedback says '-', meaning A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. Therefore, the word has an A somewhere else, and we must not put A at the 3rd position again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste? Since we know it's not there, we shouldn't put it there again? No: actually, if we put A again at position 3, we get the same feedback: '-' meaning it's still not correct. But we already know that. So to gain new information, we should put A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know:
 - A is not at position 3 -> so try A at positions 1,2,4,5?
 - N is not at position 4 -> try at 1,2,3,5?
 - E is not at position 5 -> try at 1,2,3,4?

 Now, we need a word that includes A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and that places:
 - A in a position that is not 3
 - N in a position that is not 4
 - E in a position that is not 5

 Also, we must avoid putting A, N, E in the positions they were previously? Not necessarily, but we want new information.

 Let's think of common five-letter words that fit. Some ideas:

 Option 1: ""LATEN"" - but that's not a word? Let me check: not standard. We need a valid English word.

 Option 2: ""ADIEU"" - but we need N? We must include A, N, E.

 Option 3: ""SALET"" - not including N and E? We need A, N, E.

 Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? 
 - S: 1st
 - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.
 - D: 3rd -> new letter
 - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.
 - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn't prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don't know yet.

 So ""SEDAN"": 
   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)
   This satisfies:
     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.
     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.
     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.

 Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.

 We don't know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).

 Let me check if ""SEDAN"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning a type of car.

 Alternatively, another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but that has A at 1st, then N at 2nd, V, I, L? But what about E? We need E.

 We must have E? Because the previous feedback said E is in the word.

 So we need a word containing A, N, E.

 Another possibility: ""LEANT""? 
   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.

 Another: ""WANED""? 
   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).
   This satisfies:
     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.
     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.
     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.

 ""WANED"" is a valid word.

 But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.

 Let me list some other words: 
   ""EATEN"": 
      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don't know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn't say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.

 So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: 
   First letter: E -> okay? 
   Second letter: A -> okay? 
   Third letter: T -> new
   Fourth letter: E -> we don't know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? So we can try.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.

 But let me compare: 
   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""

 I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).

 How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven't used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

 I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: 
   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.

 Alternatively, ""LANES""?
   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.
   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)
   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)
   S (5)

 So ""LANES"": 
   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).

 Also, introduces L and S.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has L and S? But that's fine.

 ""LANES"" is a valid English word.

 How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.

 Let me look at frequency of letters: 
   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? 

 But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.

 I think I'll go with ""LANES"" because it tests more common letters? Or ""SEDAN""? Actually, let me pick one.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that places E at the start? But let me avoid.

 After thinking, I choose ""LANES"":

 Reason: 
 - It uses L and S, which are common.
 - It moves A, N, E to entirely new positions: A from 3 to 2, N from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4.

 But note: position 3 and 4 were previously occupied by A and N? Now we are putting N at 3 and E at 4? That's okay? Because we are testing new letters at those positions.

 However, note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we assume one of each? Since ""crane"" had distinct and the feedback didn't show duplicates? We cannot assume? But unless we see duplicate feedback, we might guess without duplicates? To avoid complexity.

 Also, we must avoid C and R? So ""LANES"" does not contain C or R? Correct.

 I'll go with ""LANES"".

<guess>lanes</guess>

But wait, there's another option: what about ""STANE""? Not a word? 

""ADEN"" is 4 letters? So no.

I think ""lanes"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""NEARS""? But R is ruled out? So we cannot use R. So avoid.

Also, ""EARNS""? has R and E? But R is ruled out? Cannot use R.

Therefore, ""lanes"" seems safe.

So my guess is ""LANES"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and R are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  
- A, N, and E are **present** but in the **wrong positions** (marked ""-"" for positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Constraints for New Guess:**  
   - Must contain **A, N, E** (since they are confirmed present).  
   - Must **avoid C and R** (confirmed absent).  
   - A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.  
   - Aim to place A, N, and E in **new positions** to gain more information and avoid wasting guesses.  

2. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - Introduce new common letters (**L and S**) to test more characters since they are frequent in English 5-letter words and not yet ruled out.  

3. **Word Choice:**  
   - Considered words like **""SEDAN""** and **""WANED""**, but **""LANES""** fits best:  
     - Positions: L(1), **A(2)**, **N(3)**, **E(4)**, S(5) → avoids banned positions for A (not 3), N (not 4), E (not 5).  
     - New letters tested: L and S.  
     - Valid English word (meaning: narrow roads or pathways).  

4. **Goal:**  
   - Maximize information about the secret word by shifting positions of A, N, E and testing new consonants.

<guess>lanes</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: lanes -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
   - This means: C and R are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 3, 4, and 5 (as guessed).
2. For ""lanes"": L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)
   - This means: L and S are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 2, 3, and 4.

 Now, combining the information:
 - The secret word must contain A, N, E (from both feedbacks).
 - The letters C, R, L, S are absent (both have 'x' in their feedback).
 - Known position constraints:
   For A: Not in position 3 (from guess1) and not in position 2 (from guess2) → so A cannot be in position 2 or 3. 
   For N: Not in position 4 (from guess1) and not 3 (from guess2) → so N cannot be in position 3 or 4.
   For E: Not in position 5 (from guess1) and not 4 (from guess2) → so E cannot be in position 4 or 5.

 Also, note that these letters must be placed in valid positions. We have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

 Let's list possible positions for A, N, E:
   A: Cannot be 2 or 3 → only positions 1, 4, 5 left.
   N: Cannot be 3 or 4 → only positions 1, 2, 5 left.
   E: Cannot be 4 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, 3 left.

 Moreover, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and must contain two additional letters (since we have A, N, E and two more). We do not know these two letters, but we know they cannot be C, R, L, S.

 We need to choose a word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (which we haven't tested and are not C,R,L,S). We must avoid using letters that we already know are absent.

 Since we have tried C,R,L,S (and they are absent), we should try other common consonants or vowels.

 The remaining letters: we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also have to consider the positions.

 Now, note that in the secret word, one of A, N, E might be duplicated? But the feedback from ""crane"" and ""lanes"" showed each of these once per word. Since we haven't seen duplicates yet, we assume each is at least one, but we should not assume exactly one? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates until we guess duplicates? We don't know. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.

 How to structure the next word?
 We have three known letters: A, N, E. We need two more letters.

 Also, the positions are constrained. Let's map the possibilities.

 We need a word where:
   - Position 1: can be A, N, or E? But also, it might be unknown? But the constraints:
        A: can be at 1,4,5
        N: can be at 1,2,5
        E: can be at 1,2,3

   For example, let's consider:
        Position 1: could be A? -> then N and E must fit in their allowed positions.

        If position 1 is A (which is allowed):
            Then for N: allowed positions 2,5 -> but position 2 for N? It's allowed? Yes, since 2 is allowed.
            For E: allowed positions 2 (but then N might be at 2? conflict?), 1 (taken by A), or 3 -> so E could be at 3.

            Example: A(1), then N at 2 and E at 3? -> word: A N E ? ?

            But then we have two positions left? And the word must have only three known letters? Wait, no: we know the word must have A, N, E and two more.

            So a word ""ANVET"" is something? Not a word. Let me think of existing words.

        Alternatively, position 1 is A, then N at 5 and E at 2? -> A ? E ? N -> example ""A?E?N""

 How about position 1 is one of the new letters? Then A, N, E must go in their allowed positions.

 Now, because we have limited tries (6 total), we need to make a guess that tests new letters and potentially fits the constraints.

 Let's list possible words that contain A,N,E and two other letters not C,R,L,S.

 Common words: 
   ""TAKEN"": 
        T, A, K, E, N -> note: includes T and K.
        Positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> but we know A cannot be at 2 (from guess2: lanes had A at 2 -> - meaning wrong position). 
           So this placement of A at 2 is disallowed -> ""TAKEN"" not valid? Because we must not put A at 2.

   ""TAKEN"" is invalid because we are forced to put A at 2? Actually, we could rearrange? But ""TAKEN"" is fixed: the word is T-A-K-E-N.

   Alternatively, ""EARTH"": but E at 1? then A at 2? Then E: position 1 is allowed? Yes. A: position 2 is disallowed? -> problem? Also, R is in the word? R is disallowed? R is absent.

   Let's choose words without disallowed letters and in valid positions.

   How about ""EATEN"":
        E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)
        But duplicate E? And A at 2? Not allowed? Also, N at 5? allowed? But E at 1 is allowed? However, A at 2 is disallowed? So invalid.

   How about ""MANGE"": 
        M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)
        Check constraints:
           A(2) -> disallowed? (since A cannot be at 2) -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT"":
        P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)
        Constraints: 
           A(2) -> disallowed? and also N(4) -> disallowed? (from first guess: N not at 4) -> so both A and N are in bad positions -> invalid.

 We need words that:
   - Avoid positions: A not in 2 or 3; N not in 3 or 4; E not in 4 or 5.

 Let me try to form:

   Option: A at 1? 
      Then positions: A _ _ _ _
      For N: allowed in 2, 5 -> but if N at 2: then _ A? and then E must be in 1,2,3? position 2 already taken? so no: then E at 3? -> word: A N ? E? -> but then position 4? Cannot put E at 4? because E cannot be at 4? 
      Actually: E cannot be at 4 or 5. So if we have A at 1 and N at 2, then we need E in positions 1,2,3 -> but 1 and 2 taken? Only position 3: so A(1) N(2) E(3) ? ? 
      Then we have two positions left? And the word must have two more letters? And E is already used?

      Example: ""ANVET"" not a word? 
      How about ""ANODE"": but O and D? And E is at 5? E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.

      How about ""ANEWS"": but S is absent? And A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, then W? and S? but S is absent -> invalid.

   Try N at position 1? 
      Then positions: N _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed in positions 1,4,5? but position 1 taken? so A at 4 or 5.
        For E: allowed in 1,2,3? taken? so E at 2 or 3.
        Example: 
          N(1), then E at 2 -> then A at 4? -> word: N E ? A ? 
          Then E at 2: so we have N E _ A _ 
          Now, we need one more letter? Actually two: positions 3 and 5.

          Example: ""NEATO""? Not a word? 
          How about ""NEATH"": 
             N(1), E(2), A(4)? then T(3), H(5) -> but note E is at 2? allowed? 
             Constraints: 
                 A at 4: allowed? Since A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> 4 is allowed? 
                 N at 1: allowed? 
                 E at 2: allowed? 
             But ""NEATH"" is an adjective meaning clean? Not very common? And we should test more common letters? 

        But also, we have T and H? We haven't tested T and H? So that's good.

        Check against our previous guesses? We haven't used T or H? So okay.

        Alternatively: ""NEAT"" is 4 letters? We need 5.

        ""VENAE""? E duplicated? Not good?

   But note: we haven't tested T, H, etc.? So let's consider.

   Another possibility: E at position 1? 
      Then E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: allowed positions 1,4,5 -> 1 taken? so 4 or 5.
        For N: allowed 1,2,5 -> 1 taken? so 2 or 5.
        Example: 
          E(1), then A at position 4 -> and N at position 2 -> E(1) N(2) ? A(4) ? 
          Then we need letter at 3 and 5? And the word must be a word.

          Example: ""END"" is 3? 
          How about ""ENTAD""? Not common? 
          Or ""EPHA""? Obscure?

   Better to use words that are common? 

   With N at 1? we have ""NEATH"" which is acceptable? But not the most common? 

   How about ""NEIGH"": 
        N(1), E(2), I(3?), G(4), H(5)
        Constraints:
          N at 1: allowed? Yes.
          E at 2: allowed? Yes.
          But I(3): no constraint yet? But then A must be in the word? We haven't placed A? So we must include A somewhere? But in ""NEIGH"", there is no A? So not valid? Because the word must have A.

   We must include A? So the word must have A.

   Therefore, in the scenario of N at 1, E at 2, we then must place A at either 4 or 5? And then fill the remaining positions? 

   If A at 4: then the word is N E ? A ? -> and we must put a letter at position 3 and 5? 
   How about N E X A T? Not a word? 

   How about ""NEVAT""? Not a word? 

   Consider A at 5? Then the word is N E ? ? A? and A at 5: which is allowed? 
   Example: ""NEBULA"" -> 6 letters? 

   So then we would have N E _ _ A? 5 letters? Like ""NESTA"" - not a word? 

   Alternatively: if we swap A and N? 

   Another idea: put A at position 1? and then E at position 3? (since E can be at 3) and N at position 5? (allowed? since N can be at 5) 
      Word: A _ E _ N
      Example: ""A?E?N"" -> words: ""ABERN"" not a word? ""AWDEN"" not a word? 

   Alternatively, how about ""AMENS""? But S is absent? Also, positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), S(5)? 
      Constraints:
          A(1): allowed.
          E(3): allowed? because E can be at 3? 
          N(4): but disallowed? because N cannot be at 4? -> so invalid.

   After careful thought, let me try to list words that include A,N,E and don't contain C,R,L,S? And that distribute the letters in their allowed positions.

   One word that comes to mind: ""DAVEN"" (which is to pray) - but positions: 
        D(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5)
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""WANED"" (we thought earlier?): 
        W(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) 
        Constraints: 
            A(2): disallowed? - because from guess2? lanes had A at 2 -> it was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at 2? -> invalid.

   Another: ""HAVEN""? Contains H, V? 
        H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) 
        Problems: 
          A(2): disallowed? 
          E(4): disallowed? E cannot be at 4? -> invalid.

   How about ""PAINT""? We saw earlier? invalid.

   I am noticing it's tricky? 

   Another common word: ""TENET""? Has duplicates? And no A? But we must have A.

   We must find a word with A.

   Let me try ""DEAN"" + a letter? But 4 letters.

   How about ""DEBAR""? R disallowed? 

   Alternatively: ""OAKEN""? 
        O(1), A(2) -> disallowed? 

   How about ""AEGIS""? But E at 2? then we don't have N? 

   We must have letters: A,N,E in it? 

   Perhaps we try ""TAKEN"" again? But A at 2 not allowed? 

   I think we must try a word with A at 1, or at 4 or 5? 

   Let me put A at 5? 
      Then for N: allowed at 1,2,5? but 5 taken by A? so at 1 or 2?
      For E: allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Example: 
          If we put A at 5, then place N at 2 and E at 3 -> word: ? N E ? A -> so _ N E _ A? 
          How about ""UNN E? A"" -> ""UNSEA"" not a word? 
          ""INTEA"" not a word? 

   Alternatively: A at 4? 
      Then word: _ _ _ A _
      N allowed at 1,2,5? 
      E allowed at 1,2,3? 
      Suppose N at 1? then E at 2? Then: N E ? A ? -> as before? 

   We try:

      ""NEUMA"": 
        N(1), E(2), U(3), M(4), A(5) ? 
        Constraints: 
          A: at position 5? -> allowed? 
          N: at position 1 -> allowed? 
          E: at position 2 -> allowed? 
        Also, U and M are new? 
        And the word ""NEUMA"" is a variant spelling of ""pneuma"" meaning spirit? Not common? 

      How about ""NEAPA"": but not a word.

      How about ""NEALA"" -> not a word? 

   One more: let me try ""AUDIO"" like start? But we need E and no A at positions 2 or 3? 

   This is challenging? 

   After research, I found:

      ""AGONE"": 
        A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> but check constraints:
          N(4): disallowed? -> cannot be at 4? 

      ""ALANE"": L disallowed? 

   Let's try ""ETNA"" not 5 letters? Add B: ""BENAY""? Not common? 

   How about ""MATEY"": no N?

   Maybe ""PANED"": 
        P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) -> constraints: 
           A(2): disallowed? 
           N(3): disallowed? 
           E(4): disallowed? 
        invalid.

   Why not try a word with duplicate letter? We haven't seen direct evidence against duplicates, though feedback hasn't shown any duplicate yet? 

   How about ""BANED"" (not common, but valid as past tense of ban?) 
        B(1), A(2) -> disallowed? -> invalid.

   Another: ""QUENA""? Not common? 

   Given the complexity, perhaps I should choose a word that tests new letters and places A, N, E in their allowed positions, even if the word might not be high-frequency? 

   I think ""NEUM"" is not 5? 

   Let me think of ""ANE? ... 
   Or let me try putting E at position 1:
        E(1) _ _ _ _
        For A: positions 4 or 5.
        For N: positions 2 or 5 (but if A at 5, then N can be at 2? or if A at 4, then N can be at 2 or 5? but 5 then conflict?).

        Example: E(1), then A at 4? -> so E _ _ A _
        Then N can be at 2: E N ? A ? -> so EN and then fourth is A, so need position 3 and 5? 

        How about ""END"" with something? ""ENTAD""?
        Or ""ENTIA"": 
            E(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), A(5) -> 
            Constraints:
              A(5): allowed? 
              N(2): allowed? 
              E(1): allowed? 
            Then word? ""ENTIA"" (plural of ens in philosophy) -> valid? 

        The word would be ""ENTIA"" (also a programming term?)? 

        Check the constraints?
          A: position 5? -> allowed (since not 2 or 3) -> yes.
          N: position 2? -> allowed (not 3 or 4) -> yes.
          E: position 1? -> allowed (not 4 or 5) -> yes.

        Also, the new letters: T and I.

        And no C,R,L,S? 

        So ""ENTIA"" is a rare word? But accepted in some dictionaries? For Wordle, we need common words? But the rules here don't specify? We just need a valid English word.

        However, there's also ""ENZIA""? 

        We must make a guess. Another common word that fits: 

        How about ""DANCE""? but C disallowed.

        Or ""FENCE""? C disallowed? 

        ""MATEY"" doesn't have N.

        After reconsideration, we can try ""OXEYE"" - but no A? 

        I decide to go with ""ENTIA"" (or perhaps ""TENIA""? or ""TIENA"" ... not a word.

        ""TINEA"": 
          T(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5) 
          Constraints:
             N(3): disallowed? (because N cannot be at 3? we have feedback: guess2 ""lanes"" had N at 3 and marked as - (present but wrong position? so it's not here? but could be in 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback for N in guess2 was - at position 3, which means N is in the word but not at position 3? So we cannot put N at 3 again? Because we know it's not there? So N(3) is disallowed? -> so ""TINEA"" has N at 3 -> invalid.)

        ""TENIA"": 
           T(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), A(5)
           Constraints:
              N(3): disallowed? -> invalid.

        ""ANTIC"": C disallowed.

        ""VENAE"": duplicate E?

        So ""ENTIA"": with the spelling E-N-T-I-A. 

        But is ""entia"" common? Not really? But let's see another word.

        Have we missed any common word for this structure? 

        How about ""EXAMS"": has X? then ""EX"" at 1? then but wait: must have N? no.

        Given the time, we choose ""ENTIA"" for now.

        But ideally, we want to test letters that can help constraint more? 

        Notice that in the feedback we have only three known present letters and many absent letters. So we should not guess a rare word? 

        Alternatively: let's try a word that places A at 4, for example, and use common letters.

        Example: A only allowed at 1,4,5? 
        Let me try positions: 
          If A is at 4, then what can be at 1?? We haven't tested many letters? Then we put a new letter at 1? and then put letters? 
          Then positions: _ _ _ A _ 
          E allowed at 1,2,3? 
          N allowed at 1,2,5? 
          If we put E at 1 and A at 4: then E _ _ A _ 
          Then for N: at positions 2,5? 
          Option: 
            E(1), N(2), then we need position 3? then A(4)? and position 5? 
            Word: E N ? A ? 
            Letter at 3 and 5: who? 

          Common words: ""ENTIA"" works? 

        So perhaps ""entia"" is the best we have? 

        But there are other words: ""MEDIA""? but then we have D, and no N? Must have N.

        ""MEDIA"" has M,E,D,I,A? missing N? invalid.

        ""PETAL""? no N.

        I also think of ""KENAF"" (a plant):
          K(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), F(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(2): allowed? -> yes.
             N(3): disallowed? -> no, because guess2: lanes had N at 3 and marked as present but not position 3? so it should be disallowed position 3? -> so N cannot be at 3? -> invalid.

        Similarly, ""BAZAR"" has R? disallowed? 

        Given the difficulty, I will go with ""ENTIA"", with the note that it might be an uncommon word? but will serve our purpose.

        Or: how about ""UNTIE""? 
          U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5)
          Constraints: 
             E(5) -> disallowed? -> so this is bad? E cannot be at 5? 

        ""UNITE"": E at 5? -> disallowed.

        Therefore, not.

        I choose ""ENTIA"".

        So our guess is ""ENTIA""After analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here's a step-by-step deduction:

### Step-by-Step Thoughts:
1. **Absent Letters:**  
   - First guess (""crane"") ruled out **C** and **R**.  
   - Second guess (""lanes"") ruled out **L** and **S**.  
   - Total absent letters: **C, R, L, S**.  
   - These cannot appear in the secret word.

2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions):**  
   - Both guesses confirm **A, N, E** are in the secret word, but misplaced:  
     - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""lanes"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 4, or 5.  
     - **N**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""lanes"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 5.  
     - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""lanes"") or 5 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 3.  

3. **Word Construction:**  
   - The next guess must include **A, N, E**, exclude **C/R/L/S**, and respects position constraints.  
   - Explore placing **A, N, E** while introducing 2 new untested letters.  
   - Possible valid positions:  
     - **Option 1:**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - N at position 2 (allowed).  
       - A at position 5 (allowed; not 2 or 3).  
       - Example word: **""ENTIA""** (meaning entities).  
       - **E(1)**, **N(2)**, T(3), I(4), **A(5)** → Valid placement.  
     - **Option 2 (retreat):**  
       - E at position 1 (allowed).  
       - A at position 4 (allowed).  
       - N at position 5 (allowed).  
       - Example word: **""EX?AN""** → Hard to find common words (e.g., ""EXMAN"" invalid).

4. **Selecting New Letters:**  
   - **T** and **I** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  
   - **ENTIA** tests both T and I, placing A/N/E correctly while maximizing new information.

5. **Confirmation:**  
   - No duplicates. Positions satisfy constraints.  
   - New letters: T and I → Potential to reveal critical info if present/absent.

Given the constraints, **""ENTIA""** is a valid guess that adheres to rules and leverages feedback optimally.

Since each letter in the guess is checked independently, if the word had two As, then if we guess one A it would show as present only once? Actually, Wordle rules: each instance is evaluated independently based on frequency. But since ""crane"" has distinct letters, the feedback tells us that the word has at least one A, one N, one E.\n\n Since the feedback shows each letter independently, and A, N, E are present but not in those positions, we should include them again, but in different positions.\n\n Also, the secret word does not have C and R at all.\n\n Now, for our next guess, we need:\n - Must include A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).\n - We should place A, N, E in different positions than in ""crane"".

Similarly for others.\n\n We also know the word is 5 letters: _ _ _ _ _\n\n We can try a word like ""MEAN"" but that\'s 4 letters. So we need 5.\n\n How about ""SANE""? That\'s 4. We need 5.\n\n Longer: ""PLANE"" -> but P and L are new, and note: we have to avoid C and R, but P and L are okay? Also, we must place A, N, E in different positions.\n\n In ""PLANE"":\n - P (1st)\n - L (2nd)\n - A (3rd) -> but from previous feedback, A cannot be at position 3? Because in ""crane"" A was at 3rd and marked wrong position? Actually, that doesn\'t necessarily mean A cannot be at 3rd. Wait, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it could be that the word has an A elsewhere, but we don\'t know if there is another A? But the rule in Wordle: the feedback tells us the minimal frequency. Actually, the secret word might have one or two As? But we don\'t know. We should assume it has exactly one A unless we see evidence otherwise? However, we must be cautious.\n\n Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" only told us that at position 3, A is not correct. It doesn\'t preclude that A might be in the word at position 3? Wait no: wait, the feedback system: \n - We guessed A at position 3, and the feedback says \'-\', meaning A is in the word but not in the 3rd position. Therefore, the word has an A somewhere else, and we must not put A at the 3rd position again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste? Since we know it\'s not there, we shouldn\'t put it there again? No: actually, if we put A again at position 3, we get the same feedback: \'-\' meaning it\'s still not correct. But we already know that. So to gain new information, we should put A in a different position.\n\n Similarly, we know:\n - A is not at position 3 -> so try A at positions 1,2,4,5?\n - N is not at position 4 -> try at 1,2,3,5?\n - E is not at position 5 -> try at 1,2,3,4?\n\n Now, we need a word that includes A, N, E and two other letters (not C or R) and that places:\n - A in a position that is not 3\n - N in a position that is not 4\n - E in a position that is not 5\n\n Also, we must avoid putting A, N, E in the positions they were previously? Not necessarily, but we want new information.\n\n Let\'s think of common five-letter words that fit. Some ideas:\n\n Option 1: ""LATEN"" - but that\'s not a word? Let me check: not standard. We need a valid English word.\n\n Option 2: ""ADIEU"" - but we need N? We must include A, N, E.\n\n Option 3: ""SALET"" - not including N and E? We need A, N, E.\n\n Option 4: How about ""SEDAN""? \n - S: 1st\n - E: 2nd -> but E previously was at 5th and now at 2nd? That is a new position and not 5? Good.\n - D: 3rd -> new letter\n - A: 4th -> previously A was at 3rd, now at 4th -> not 3rd? Good.\n - N: 5th -> previously N was at 4th, now at 5th -> but the previous feedback said N was not at 4th, but doesn\'t prohibit 5th? The feedback said N is in the word but wrong position (so not at 4th). It could be at 5th? We don\'t know yet.\n\n So ""SEDAN"": \n   Positions: S(1), E(2), D(3), A(4), N(5)\n   This satisfies:\n     A is at 4 (not 3) -> okay.\n     N is at 5 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because the previous feedback only said not at 4.\n     E is at 2 (not 5) -> okay.\n\n Now, what about the letters: we are introducing S, D.\n\n We don\'t know if S and D are in the word? The secret word must have A, N, E and two others (possibly S and D? or something else).\n\n Let me check if ""SEDAN"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning a type of car.\n\n Alternatively, another word: ""ANVIL"" -> but that has A at 1st, then N at 2nd, V, I, L? But what about E? We need E.\n\n We must have E? Because the previous feedback said E is in the word.\n\n So we need a word containing A, N, E.\n\n Another possibility: ""LEANT""? \n   L (1), E (2), A (3) -> but we cannot put A at 3? Because previous feedback said A is not at position 3. So this would be bad.\n\n Another: ""WANED""? \n   W (1), A (2), N (3), E (4), D (5).\n   This satisfies:\n     A: position 2 (not 3) -> okay.\n     N: position 3 (not 4) -> okay? Yes, because previous was 4th, now 3rd is new.\n     E: position 4 (not 5) -> okay.\n\n ""WANED"" is a valid word.\n\n But note: the previous feedback had E marked at 5th but now we put E at 4th. This is acceptable.\n\n Let me list some other words: \n   ""EATEN"": \n      E (1) -> avoids 5th? but we have to put E at 1st? okay? But also A is at 2nd (avoiding 3rd) and T new, then E at 1st and then N at 4th -> but wait: ""EATEN"" has two E\'s? Actually, E at 1st and 4th? We are placing E at two positions? But we don\'t know if the word has two Es? Actually, the feedback from ""crane"": we had E at 5th and it was marked present. It doesn\'t say how many, so there might be one or more. But if we guess two Es, we might get ambiguous feedback.\n\n So ""EATEN"" would be considered. But note, we are introducing T? Also, note: \n   First letter: E -> okay? \n   Second letter: A -> okay? \n   Third letter: T -> new\n   Fourth letter: E -> we don\'t know if we are allowed to duplicate? But the previous feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? So we can try.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters we know are not in the word? C and R are ruled out. T is new? We can use.\n\n But let me compare: \n   ""SEDAN"" vs ""WANED"" vs ""EATEN""\n\n I need to choose one that maximizes new information? Also, we have only used A, N, E so far? We want to test as many new letters as possible? We have two spots for new letters (since we have to include A,N,E).\n\n How about we try a word that does not duplicate any positions? And we use common letters that we haven\'t used? Letters that have not appeared: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\n I think ""SEDAN"" is a reasonable choice because S and D are common. Also, note the positions: \n   A is moved from 3rd to 4th, N from 4th to 5th, E from 5th to 2nd.\n\n Alternatively, ""LANES""?\n   L (1), A (2) -> avoiding 3rd? okay.\n   N (3) -> avoiding 4th? okay? (since previously at 4th, now at 3rd)\n   E (4) -> avoiding 5th? okay? (since previously at 5th, now at 4th)\n   S (5)\n\n So ""LANES"": \n   Places A at 2nd (new), N at 3rd (new), E at 4th (new).\n\n Also, introduces L and S.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has L and S? But that\'s fine.\n\n ""LANES"" is a valid English word.\n\n How about commonality? Both ""LANES"" and ""SEDAN"" are reasonable.\n\n Let me look at frequency of letters: \n   S is very common, L is common, and D is common? \n\n But we also have to consider: by placing E at 4th? Actually, in our previous guess, E was at 5th and not there. We think E might be elsewhere? Similarly for others.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""LANES"" because it tests more common letters? Or ""SEDAN""? Actually, let me pick one.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that places E at the start? But let me avoid.\n\n After thinking, I choose ""LANES"":\n\n Reason: \n - It uses L and S, which are common.\n - It moves A, N, E to entirely new positions: A from 3 to 2, N from 4 to 3, E from 5 to 4.\n\n But note: position 3 and 4 were previously occupied by A and N? Now we are putting N at 3 and E at 4? That\'s okay? Because we are testing new letters at those positions.\n\n However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we assume one of each? Since ""crane"" had distinct and the feedback didn\'t show duplicates? We cannot assume? But unless we see duplicate feedback, we might guess without duplicates? To avoid complexity.\n\n Also, we must avoid C and R? So ""LANES"" does not contain C or R? Correct.\n\n I\'ll go with ""LANES"".\n\n<guess>lanes</guess>\n\nBut wait, there\'s another option: what about ""STANE""? Not a word? \n\n""ADEN"" is 4 letters? So no.\n\nI think ""lanes"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""NEARS""? But R is ruled out? So we cannot use R. So avoid.\n\nAlso, ""EARNS""? has R and E? But R is ruled out? Cannot use R.\n\nTherefore, ""lanes"" seems safe.\n\nSo my guess is ""LANES"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and R are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").  \n- A, N, and E are **present** but in the **wrong positions** (marked ""-"" for positions 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  \n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Constraints for New Guess:**  \n   - Must contain **A, N, E** (since they are confirmed present).  \n   - Must **avoid C and R** (confirmed absent).  \n   - A cannot be in position 3, N cannot be in position 4, and E cannot be in position 5.  \n   - Aim to place A, N, and E in **new positions** to gain more information and avoid wasting guesses.  \n\n2. **Selecting New Letters:**  \n   - Introduce new common letters (**L and S**) to test more characters since they are frequent in English 5-letter words and not yet ruled out.  \n\n3. **Word Choice:**  \n   - Considered words like **""SEDAN""** and **""WANED""**, but **""LANES""** fits best:  \n     - Positions: L(1), **A(2)**, **N(3)**, **E(4)**, S(5) → avoids banned positions for A (not 3), N (not 4), E (not 5).  \n     - New letters tested: L and S.  \n     - Valid English word (meaning: narrow roads or pathways).  \n\n4. **Goal:**  \n   - Maximize information about the secret word by shifting positions of A, N, E and testing new consonants.\n\n<guess>lanes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: lanes -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. For ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\n   - This means: C and R are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 3, 4, and 5 (as guessed).\n2. For ""lanes"": L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\n   - This means: L and S are not in the secret word. A, N, and E are in the secret word but not in the positions 2, 3, and 4.\n\n Now, combining the information:\n - The secret word must contain A, N, E (from both feedbacks).\n - The letters C, R, L, S are absent (both have \'x\' in their feedback).\n - Known position constraints:\n   For A: Not in position 3 (from guess1) and not in position 2 (from guess2) → so A cannot be in position 2 or 3. \n   For N: Not in position 4 (from guess1) and not 3 (from guess2) → so N cannot be in position 3 or 4.\n   For E: Not in position 5 (from guess1) and not 4 (from guess2) → so E cannot be in position 4 or 5.\n\n Also, note that these letters must be placed in valid positions. We have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n Let\'s list possible positions for A, N, E:\n   A: Cannot be 2 or 3 → only positions 1, 4, 5 left.\n   N: Cannot be 3 or 4 → only positions 1, 2, 5 left.\n   E: Cannot be 4 or 5 → only positions 1, 2, 3 left.\n\n Moreover, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and must contain two additional letters (since we have A, N, E and two more). We do not know these two letters, but we know they cannot be C, R, L, S.\n\n We need to choose a word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (which we haven\'t tested and are not C,R,L,S). We must avoid using letters that we already know are absent.\n\n Since we have tried C,R,L,S (and they are absent), we should try other common consonants or vowels.\n\n The remaining letters: we haven\'t tested B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also have to consider the positions.\n\n Now, note that in the secret word, one of A, N, E might be duplicated? But the feedback from ""crane"" and ""lanes"" showed each of these once per word. Since we haven\'t seen duplicates yet, we assume each is at least one, but we should not assume exactly one? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates until we guess duplicates? We don\'t know. To be safe, we avoid duplicates for now.\n\n How to structure the next word?\n We have three known letters: A, N, E. We need two more letters.\n\n Also, the positions are constrained. Let\'s map the possibilities.\n\n We need a word where:\n   - Position 1: can be A, N, or E? But also, it might be unknown? But the constraints:\n        A: can be at 1,4,5\n        N: can be at 1,2,5\n        E: can be at 1,2,3\n\n   For example, let\'s consider:\n        Position 1: could be A? -> then N and E must fit in their allowed positions.\n\n        If position 1 is A (which is allowed):\n            Then for N: allowed positions 2,5 -> but position 2 for N? It\'s allowed? Yes, since 2 is allowed.\n            For E: allowed positions 2 (but then N might be at 2? conflict?), 1 (taken by A), or 3 -> so E could be at 3.\n\n            Example: A(1), then N at 2 and E at 3? -> word: A N E ? ?\n\n            But then we have two positions left? And the word must have only three known letters? Wait, no: we know the word must have A, N, E and two more.\n\n            So a word ""ANVET"" is something? Not a word. Let me think of existing words.\n\n        Alternatively, position 1 is A, then N at 5 and E at 2? -> A ? E ? N -> example ""A?E?N""\n\n How about position 1 is one of the new letters? Then A, N, E must go in their allowed positions.\n\n Now, because we have limited tries (6 total), we need to make a guess that tests new letters and potentially fits the constraints.\n\n Let\'s list possible words that contain A,N,E and two other letters not C,R,L,S.\n\n Common words: \n   ""TAKEN"": \n        T, A, K, E, N -> note: includes T and K.\n        Positions: T(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), N(5)\n        Check constraints:\n           A(2) -> but we know A cannot be at 2 (from guess2: lanes had A at 2 -> - meaning wrong position). \n           So this placement of A at 2 is disallowed -> ""TAKEN"" not valid? Because we must not put A at 2.\n\n   ""TAKEN"" is invalid because we are forced to put A at 2? Actually, we could rearrange? But ""TAKEN"" is fixed: the word is T-A-K-E-N.\n\n   Alternatively, ""EARTH"": but E at 1? then A at 2? Then E: position 1 is allowed? Yes. A: position 2 is disallowed? -> problem? Also, R is in the word? R is disallowed? R is absent.\n\n   Let\'s choose words without disallowed letters and in valid positions.\n\n   How about ""EATEN"":\n        E(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)\n        But duplicate E? And A at 2? Not allowed? Also, N at 5? allowed? But E at 1 is allowed? However, A at 2 is disallowed? So invalid.\n\n   How about ""MANGE"": \n        M(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), E(5)\n        Check constraints:\n           A(2) -> disallowed? (since A cannot be at 2) -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""PAINT"":\n        P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5)\n        Constraints: \n           A(2) -> disallowed? and also N(4) -> disallowed? (from first guess: N not at 4) -> so both A and N are in bad positions -> invalid.\n\n We need words that:\n   - Avoid positions: A not in 2 or 3; N not in 3 or 4; E not in 4 or 5.\n\n Let me try to form:\n\n   Option: A at 1? \n      Then positions: A _ _ _ _\n      For N: allowed in 2, 5 -> but if N at 2: then _ A? and then E must be in 1,2,3? position 2 already taken? so no: then E at 3? -> word: A N ? E? -> but then position 4? Cannot put E at 4? because E cannot be at 4? \n      Actually: E cannot be at 4 or 5. So if we have A at 1 and N at 2, then we need E in positions 1,2,3 -> but 1 and 2 taken? Only position 3: so A(1) N(2) E(3) ? ? \n      Then we have two positions left? And the word must have two more letters? And E is already used?\n\n      Example: ""ANVET"" not a word? \n      How about ""ANODE"": but O and D? And E is at 5? E cannot be at 5 -> invalid.\n\n      How about ""ANEWS"": but S is absent? And A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, then W? and S? but S is absent -> invalid.\n\n   Try N at position 1? \n      Then positions: N _ _ _ _\n        For A: allowed in positions 1,4,5? but position 1 taken? so A at 4 or 5.\n        For E: allowed in 1,2,3? taken? so E at 2 or 3.\n        Example: \n          N(1), then E at 2 -> then A at 4? -> word: N E ? A ? \n          Then E at 2: so we have N E _ A _ \n          Now, we need one more letter? Actually two: positions 3 and 5.\n\n          Example: ""NEATO""? Not a word? \n          How about ""NEATH"": \n             N(1), E(2), A(4)? then T(3), H(5) -> but note E is at 2? allowed? \n             Constraints: \n                 A at 4: allowed? Since A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> 4 is allowed? \n                 N at 1: allowed? \n                 E at 2: allowed? \n             But ""NEATH"" is an adjective meaning clean? Not very common? And we should test more common letters? \n\n        But also, we have T and H? We haven\'t tested T and H? So that\'s good.\n\n        Check against our previous guesses? We haven\'t used T or H? So okay.\n\n        Alternatively: ""NEAT"" is 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n        ""VENAE""? E duplicated? Not good?\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tested T, H, etc.? So let\'s consider.\n\n   Another possibility: E at position 1? \n      Then E(1) _ _ _ _\n        For A: allowed positions 1,4,5 -> 1 taken? so 4 or 5.\n        For N: allowed 1,2,5 -> 1 taken? so 2 or 5.\n        Example: \n          E(1), then A at position 4 -> and N at position 2 -> E(1) N(2) ? A(4) ? \n          Then we need letter at 3 and 5? And the word must be a word.\n\n          Example: ""END"" is 3? \n          How about ""ENTAD""? Not common? \n          Or ""EPHA""? Obscure?\n\n   Better to use words that are common? \n\n   With N at 1? we have ""NEATH"" which is acceptable? But not the most common? \n\n   How about ""NEIGH"": \n        N(1), E(2), I(3?), G(4), H(5)\n        Constraints:\n          N at 1: allowed? Yes.\n          E at 2: allowed? Yes.\n          But I(3): no constraint yet? But then A must be in the word? We haven\'t placed A? So we must include A somewhere? But in ""NEIGH"", there is no A? So not valid? Because the word must have A.\n\n   We must include A? So the word must have A.\n\n   Therefore, in the scenario of N at 1, E at 2, we then must place A at either 4 or 5? And then fill the remaining positions? \n\n   If A at 4: then the word is N E ? A ? -> and we must put a letter at position 3 and 5? \n   How about N E X A T? Not a word? \n\n   How about ""NEVAT""? Not a word? \n\n   Consider A at 5? Then the word is N E ? ? A? and A at 5: which is allowed? \n   Example: ""NEBULA"" -> 6 letters? \n\n   So then we would have N E _ _ A? 5 letters? Like ""NESTA"" - not a word? \n\n   Alternatively: if we swap A and N? \n\n   Another idea: put A at position 1? and then E at position 3? (since E can be at 3) and N at position 5? (allowed? since N can be at 5) \n      Word: A _ E _ N\n      Example: ""A?E?N"" -> words: ""ABERN"" not a word? ""AWDEN"" not a word? \n\n   Alternatively, how about ""AMENS""? But S is absent? Also, positions: A(1), M(2), E(3), N(4), S(5)? \n      Constraints:\n          A(1): allowed.\n          E(3): allowed? because E can be at 3? \n          N(4): but disallowed? because N cannot be at 4? -> so invalid.\n\n   After careful thought, let me try to list words that include A,N,E and don\'t contain C,R,L,S? And that distribute the letters in their allowed positions.\n\n   One word that comes to mind: ""DAVEN"" (which is to pray) - but positions: \n        D(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5)\n        Constraints: \n            A(2): disallowed? -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""WANED"" (we thought earlier?): \n        W(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5) \n        Constraints: \n            A(2): disallowed? - because from guess2? lanes had A at 2 -> it was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at 2? -> invalid.\n\n   Another: ""HAVEN""? Contains H, V? \n        H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), N(5) \n        Problems: \n          A(2): disallowed? \n          E(4): disallowed? E cannot be at 4? -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""PAINT""? We saw earlier? invalid.\n\n   I am noticing it\'s tricky? \n\n   Another common word: ""TENET""? Has duplicates? And no A? But we must have A.\n\n   We must find a word with A.\n\n   Let me try ""DEAN"" + a letter? But 4 letters.\n\n   How about ""DEBAR""? R disallowed? \n\n   Alternatively: ""OAKEN""? \n        O(1), A(2) -> disallowed? \n\n   How about ""AEGIS""? But E at 2? then we don\'t have N? \n\n   We must have letters: A,N,E in it? \n\n   Perhaps we try ""TAKEN"" again? But A at 2 not allowed? \n\n   I think we must try a word with A at 1, or at 4 or 5? \n\n   Let me put A at 5? \n      Then for N: allowed at 1,2,5? but 5 taken by A? so at 1 or 2?\n      For E: allowed at 1,2,3? \n      Example: \n          If we put A at 5, then place N at 2 and E at 3 -> word: ? N E ? A -> so _ N E _ A? \n          How about ""UNN E? A"" -> ""UNSEA"" not a word? \n          ""INTEA"" not a word? \n\n   Alternatively: A at 4? \n      Then word: _ _ _ A _\n      N allowed at 1,2,5? \n      E allowed at 1,2,3? \n      Suppose N at 1? then E at 2? Then: N E ?

Not common? \n\n   Given the complexity, perhaps I should choose a word that tests new letters and places A, N, E in their allowed positions, even if the word might not be high-frequency? \n\n   I think ""NEUM"" is not 5? \n\n   Let me think of ""ANE? ... \n   Or let me try putting E at position 1:\n        E(1) _ _ _ _\n        For A: positions 4 or 5.\n        For N: positions 2 or 5 (but if A at 5, then N can be at 2? or if A at 4, then N can be at 2 or 5? but 5 then conflict?).\n\n        Example: E(1), then A at 4? -> so E _ _ A _\n        Then N can be at 2: E N ?

C disallowed? \n\n        ""MATEY"" doesn\'t have N.\n\n        After reconsideration, we can try ""OXEYE"" - but no A? \n\n        I decide to go with ""ENTIA"" (or perhaps ""TENIA""? or ""TIENA"" ... not a word.\n\n        ""TINEA"": \n          T(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), A(5) \n          Constraints:\n             N(3): disallowed?

So we should not guess a rare word? \n\n        Alternatively: let\'s try a word that places A at 4, for example, and use common letters.\n\n        Example: A only allowed at 1,4,5? \n        Let me try positions: \n          If A is at 4, then what can be at 1?? We haven\'t tested many letters? Then we put a new letter at 1? and then put letters? \n          Then positions: _ _ _ A _ \n          E allowed at 1,2,3? \n          N allowed at 1,2,5? \n          If we put E at 1 and A at 4: then E _ _ A _ \n          Then for N: at positions 2,5? \n          Option: \n            E(1), N(2), then we need position 3? then A(4)? and position 5? \n            Word: E N ? A ? \n            Letter at 3 and 5: who? \n\n          Common words: ""ENTIA"" works? \n\n        So perhaps ""entia"" is the best we have? \n\n        But there are other words: ""MEDIA""? but then we have D, and no N? Must have N.\n\n        ""MEDIA"" has M,E,D,I,A? missing N? invalid.\n\n        ""PETAL""? no N.\n\n        I also think of ""KENAF"" (a plant):\n          K(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), F(5)\n          Constraints: \n             E(2): allowed? -> yes.\n             N(3): disallowed? -> no, because guess2: lanes had N at 3 and marked as present but not position 3? so it should be disallowed position 3? -> so N cannot be at 3? -> invalid.\n\n        Similarly, ""BAZAR"" has R? disallowed? \n\n        Given the difficulty, I will go with ""ENTIA"", with the note that it might be an uncommon word? but will serve our purpose.\n\n        Or: how about ""UNTIE""? \n          U(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), E(5)\n          Constraints: \n             E(5) -> disallowed? -> so this is bad? E cannot be at 5? \n\n        ""UNITE"": E at 5? -> disallowed.\n\n        Therefore, not.\n\n        I choose ""ENTIA"".\n\n        So our guess is ""ENTIA""After analyzing the feedback from both guesses, here\'s a step-by-step deduction:\n\n### Step-by-Step Thoughts:\n1. **Absent Letters:**  \n   - First guess (""crane"") ruled out **C** and **R**.  \n   - Second guess (""lanes"") ruled out **L** and **S**.  \n   - Total absent letters: **C, R, L, S**.  \n   - These cannot appear in the secret word.\n\n2. **Present Letters (Wrong Positions):**  \n   - Both guesses confirm **A, N, E** are in the secret word, but misplaced:  \n     - **A**: Cannot be in position 2 (from ""lanes"") or 3 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 4, or 5.  \n     - **N**: Cannot be in position 3 (from ""lanes"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 5.  \n     - **E**: Cannot be in position 4 (from ""lanes"") or 5 (from ""crane""). Valid positions: 1, 2, or 3.  \n\n3. **Word Construction:**  \n   - The next guess must include **A, N, E**, exclude **C/R/L/S**, and respects position constraints.  \n   - Explore placing **A, N, E** while introducing 2 new untested letters.  \n   - Possible valid positions:  \n     - **Option 1:**  \n       - E at position 1 (allowed).  \n       - N at position 2 (allowed).  \n       - A at position 5 (allowed; not 2 or 3).  \n       - Example word: **""ENTIA""** (meaning entities).  \n       - **E(1)**, **N(2)**, T(3), I(4), **A(5)** → Valid placement.  \n     - **Option 2 (retreat):**  \n       - E at position 1 (allowed).  \n       - A at position 4 (allowed).  \n       - N at position 5 (allowed).  \n       - Example word: **""EX?AN""** → Hard to find common words (e.g., ""EXMAN"" invalid).\n\n4. **Selecting New Letters:**  \n   - **T** and **I** are high-frequency consonants not yet tested.  \n   - **ENTIA** tests both T and I, placing A/N/E correctly while maximizing new information.\n\n5. **Confirmation:**  \n   - No duplicates. Positions satisfy constraints.  \n   - New letters: T and I → Potential to reveal critical info if present/absent.\n\nGiven the constraints, **""ENTIA""** is a valid guess that adheres to rules and leverages feedback optimally.\n\n<guess>entia</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: lanes -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: entia -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(✓) T(x) I(x) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""entia"": 
   E(-) N(✓) T(x) I(x) A(-)

 This means:
   - E is in the word but not at position 1 (since we guessed E at 1 and got '-')
   - N is in the word and at the correct position (position 2) -> so the secret word has N at the second position.
   - T is not in the word at all (x)
   - I is not in the word at all (x)
   - A is in the word but not at position 5 (since we guessed A at 5 and got '-')

 Now, combining with previous feedback:

 Known absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I  (from all guesses: crane, lanes, entia)
 Known present letters: A, E, and we know N is at position 2.

 Also, we have position constraints:

   For A: 
        Previously: not at 2 (from lanes), not at 3 (from crane), not at 5 (from entia) -> so the only position left is 1 or 4? 
        But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
        We know:
          - crane: A at 3 -> not there -> so A not at 3.
          - lanes: A at 2 -> not there -> so A not at 2.
          - entia: A at 5 -> not there -> so A not at 5.
        Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

   For E:
        Previously: 
          - crane: E at 5 -> not there -> so E not at 5.
          - lanes: E at 4 -> not there -> so E not at 4.
          - entia: E at 1 -> not there -> so E not at 1.
        Therefore, E must be at position 2 or 3? 
        But wait: position 2 is now taken by N (since we have N at 2 and it's correct). 
        So E cannot be at 2? because one letter per position? 
        Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

        However, we must confirm: the secret word has N at position 2, so E cannot be at 2. 
        Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

        But let's check the constraints for E: 
          - Not at 1 (entia), not at 4 (lanes), not at 5 (crane). 
          - And now position 2 is taken by N? 
          - So only position 3 is left? 

        Therefore, E must be at position 3.

   For N: we know it is at position 2 (correct).

   So far, we have:
        Position 1: ? 
        Position 2: N (fixed)
        Position 3: E (fixed)
        Position 4: ? 
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know A must be at position 1 or 4? 

   Also, the secret word has A and E (we already have E at 3) and N at 2, so we need two more letters? 

   But note: we have three known letters: A, E, N? and we have placed E and N? and A is to be placed? 

   The secret word must have exactly the letters: A, E, N and two others? 

   However, we have already used three: A, E, N? and we have two positions left? 

   But we know the secret word has at least A, E, N? and we have two more letters? 

   Now, the two remaining positions: 1 and 4 and 5? Actually, we have:
        Position 1: must be either A or a new letter? 
        Position 4: must be either A (if not at 1) or a new letter?
        Position 5: a new letter? 

   But we know A must be at 1 or 4? 

   Therefore, the word structure is:

        Option A: 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: N
            Position 3: E
            Position 4: ? 
            Position 5: ? 

        Option B:
            Position 1: ? 
            Position 2: N
            Position 3: E
            Position 4: A
            Position 5: ? 

   We also know the absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I. So we must avoid these.

   We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses two new letters (not in the absent list) for the remaining positions.

   Let's list the absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I. 
   So available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Now, we can try to form words:

   Option A: ""A N E ? ?"" 
        The word must start with ""ANE"" and then two letters? 
        Examples: 
          ""ANEW"" -> but W is available? and we have two more positions? ""ANEW"" is 4 letters? 
          ""ANECD"" -> not a word? 
          ""ANELE"" -> duplicate E? and E is already at 3? 
          ""ANENT"" -> but T is absent? 
          ""ANEAR"" -> R absent? 
          ""ANELE"" -> not valid? 
        How about ""ANODE"": 
          O and D? 
          But O and D are available? 
          But note: we have position 4: O, position 5: D? 
          So ""ANODE"": A(1), N(2), E(3)? -> but wait, ""ANODE"" is A-N-O-D-E? 
          So positions: 
            1: A -> allowed? 
            2: N -> correct? 
            3: O? but we need E at 3? -> no, we have O at 3? but we require E at 3? 
          So not.

        We need the third letter to be E? So the word must be ""ANExx"" with E at 3? 

        How about ""ANEWS""? but S is absent? 
        ""ANEMY""? M and Y? 
          ""ANEMY"" is an old word for enemy? 
          Positions: 
            1: A -> allowed? 
            2: N -> correct? 
            3: E -> correct? 
            4: M -> new letter? 
            5: Y -> new letter? 
          But we have to check if M and Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list? 

        However, the word ""ANEMY"" might not be common? 

        Another: ""ANEAR""? R absent? 

        ""ANELA""? L absent? 

        ""ANENT"" -> T absent? 

        ""ANEV"" not a word? 

        So Option A might be hard? 

   Option B: ""? N E A ?"" 
        The word has: 
          Position 1: ? 
          Position 2: N
          Position 3: E
          Position 4: A
          Position 5: ? 

        Examples: 
          ""UNEAK"" -> not a word? 
          ""ONEAK"" -> not? 
          ""INEAK"" -> I absent? 
          ""SNEAK"" -> S absent? 
          ""KNEAK"" -> not a word? 
          ""BNEAK"" -> not? 

        How about ""WNEAL""? not a word? 

        Common words: 
          ""KNEAD"": 
             K(1), N(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) 
             This fits: 
                 Position 1: K -> new letter? 
                 Position 2: N -> correct? 
                 Position 3: E -> correct? 
                 Position 4: A -> allowed? (since A can be at 4) 
                 Position 5: D -> new letter? 
             And K and D are not in the absent list? 
             ""KNEAD"" is a common word (meaning to work dough).

        Another: ""KNEAP""? not common? 

        ""KNEAD"" seems perfect.

        But let's check if there are others? 
          ""BREAD"" -> R absent? 
          ""DREAD"" -> R absent? 
          ""FREAK"" -> R absent? 
          ""WREAK"" -> R absent? 

        So ""KNEAD"" is a strong candidate.

        Also, note: we have not used K or D? 

        Therefore, we guess ""KNEAD"".

   But wait: we must confirm the constraints for A? 
        In ""KNEAD"", A is at position 4 -> which is allowed? because we only ruled out positions 2,3,5 for A? 

   And E is at 3? which is the position we deduced? 

   And N at 2? correct.

   So we go with ""KNEAD"".

### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - C (absent), R (absent), A (present, wrong position), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position).  
2. **Guess 2 (""lanes""):**  
   - L (absent), A (present, wrong position), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position), S (absent).  
3. **Guess 3 (""entia""):**  
   - E (present, wrong position), N (correct position), T (absent), I (absent), A (present, wrong position).  

### Deductions:
- **Absent Letters:** C, R, L, S, T, I (cannot be in the word).  
- **Present Letters:**  
  - **N** is confirmed at **position 2** (from ""entia"" feedback).  
  - **E** must be at **position 3** (ruled out positions 1, 4, 5 from all feedback; position 2 is taken by N).  
  - **A** must be at **position 1 or 4** (ruled out positions 2, 3, 5 from all feedback).  
- **Word Structure:**  
  - Position 2: **N** (fixed).  
  - Position 3: **E** (fixed).  
  - Positions 1 and 4: **A** must occupy one (either 1 or 4), and the other is a new letter.  
  - Position 5: A new letter (not A, since A can only be at 1 or 4).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **Option B** from deductions: **? N E A ?** (A at position 4).  
- Choose a valid word with:  
  - Position 1: New letter (not in absent list).  
  - Position 4: **A**.  
  - Position 5: New letter (not in absent list).  
- **""KNEAD""** fits perfectly:  
  - **K** (position 1, new letter),  
  - **N** (position 2, correct),  
  - **E** (position 3, correct),  
  - **A** (position 4, allowed),  
  - **D** (position 5, new letter).  
- **K** and **D** are common letters not ruled out.

   E(-) N(✓) T(x) I(x) A(-)

 This means:
   - E is in the word but not at position 1 (since we guessed E at 1 and got '-')
   - N is in the word and at the correct position (position 2) -> so the secret word has N at the second position.
   - T is not in the word at all (x)
   - I is not in the word at all (x)
   - A is in the word but not at position 5 (since we guessed A at 5 and got '-')

 Now, combining with previous feedback:

 Known absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I  (from all guesses: crane, lanes, entia)
 Known present letters: A, E, and we know N is at position 2.

 Also, we have position constraints:

   For A: 
        Previously: not at 2 (from lanes), not at 3 (from crane), not at 5 (from entia) -> so the only position left is 1 or 4? 
        But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
        We know:
          - crane: A at 3 -> not there -> so A not at 3.
          - lanes: A at 2 -> not there -> so A not at 2.
          - entia: A at 5 -> not there -> so A not at 5.
        Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

   For E:
        Previously: 
          - crane: E at 5 -> not there -> so E not at 5.
          - lanes: E at 4 -> not there -> so E not at 4.
          - entia: E at 1 -> not there -> so E not at 1.
        Therefore, E must be at position 2 or 3? 
        But wait: position 2 is now taken by N (since we have N at 2 and it's correct). 
        So E cannot be at 2? because one letter per position? 
        Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

        However, we must confirm: the secret word has N at position 2, so E cannot be at 2. 
        Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

        But let's check the constraints for E: 
          - Not at 1 (entia), not at 4 (lanes), not at 5 (crane). 
          - And now position 2 is taken by N? 
          - So only position 3 is left? 

        Therefore, E must be at position 3.

   For N: we know it is at position 2 (correct).

   So far, we have:
        Position 1: ? 
        Position 2: N (fixed)
        Position 3: E (fixed)
        Position 4: ? 
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know A must be at position 1 or 4? 

   Also, the secret word has A and E (we already have E at 3) and N at 2, so we need two more letters? 

   But note: we have three known letters: A, E, N? and we have placed E and N? and A is to be placed? 

   The secret word must have exactly the letters: A, E, N and two others? 

   However, we have already used three: A, E, N? and we have two positions left? 

   But we know the secret word has at least A, E, N? and we have two more letters? 

   Now, the two remaining positions: 1 and 4 and 5? Actually, we have:
        Position 1: must be either A or a new letter? 
        Position 4: must be either A (if not at 1) or a new letter?
        Position 5: a new letter? 

   But we know A must be at 1 or 4? 

   Therefore, the word structure is:

        Option A: 
            Position 1: A
            Position 2: N
            Position 3: E
            Position 4: ? 
            Position 5: ? 

        Option B:
            Position 1: ? 
            Position 2: N
            Position 3: E
            Position 4: A
            Position 5: ? 

   We also know the absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I. So we must avoid these.

   We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses two new letters (not in the absent list) for the remaining positions.

   Let's list the absent letters: C, R, L, S, T, I. 
   So available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Now, we can try to form words:

   Option A: ""A N E ? ?"" 
        The word must start with ""ANE"" and then two letters? 
        Examples: 
          ""ANEW"" -> but W is available? and we have two more positions? ""ANEW"" is 4 letters? 
          ""ANECD"" -> not a word? 
          ""ANELE"" -> duplicate E? and E is already at 3? 
          ""ANENT"" -> but T is absent? 
          ""ANEAR"" -> R absent? 
          ""ANELE"" -> not valid? 
        How about ""ANODE"": 
          O and D? 
          But O and D are available? 
          But note: we have position 4: O, position 5: D? 
          So ""ANODE"": A(1), N(2), E(3)? -> but wait, ""ANODE"" is A-N-O-D-E? 
          So positions: 
            1: A -> allowed? 
            2: N -> correct? 
            3: O? but we need E at 3? -> no, we have O at 3? but we require E at 3? 
          So not.

        We need the third letter to be E? So the word must be ""ANExx"" with E at 3? 

        How about ""ANEWS""? but S is absent? 
        ""ANEMY""? M and Y? 
          ""ANEMY"" is an old word for enemy? 
          Positions: 
            1: A -> allowed? 
            2: N -> correct? 
            3: E -> correct? 
            4: M -> new letter? 
            5: Y -> new letter? 
          But we have to check if M and Y are allowed? They are not in the absent list? 

        However, the word ""ANEMY"" might not be common? 

        Another: ""ANEAR""? R absent? 

        ""ANELA""? L absent? 

        ""ANENT"" -> T absent? 

        ""ANEV"" not a word? 

        So Option A might be hard? 

   Option B: ""? N E A ?"" 
        The word has: 
          Position 1: ? 
          Position 2: N
          Position 3: E
          Position 4: A
          Position 5: ? 

        Examples: 
          ""UNEAK"" -> not a word? 
          ""ONEAK"" -> not? 
          ""INEAK"" -> I absent? 
          ""SNEAK"" -> S absent? 
          ""KNEAK"" -> not a word? 
          ""BNEAK"" -> not? 

        How about ""WNEAL""? not a word? 

        Common words: 
          ""KNEAD"": 
             K(1), N(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) 
             This fits: 
                 Position 1: K -> new letter? 
                 Position 2: N -> correct? 
                 Position 3: E -> correct? 
                 Position 4: A -> allowed? (since A can be at 4) 
                 Position 5: D -> new letter? 
             And K and D are not in the absent list? 
             ""KNEAD"" is a common word (meaning to work dough).

        Another: ""KNEAP""? not common? 

        ""KNEAD"" seems perfect.

        But let's check if there are others? 
          ""BREAD"" -> R absent? 
          ""DREAD"" -> R absent? 
          ""FREAK"" -> R absent? 
          ""WREAK"" -> R absent? 

        So ""KNEAD"" is a strong candidate.

        Also, note: we have not used K or D? 

        Therefore, we guess ""KNEAD"".

   But wait: we must confirm the constraints for A? 
        In ""KNEAD"", A is at position 4 -> which is allowed? because we only ruled out positions 2,3,5 for A? 

   And E is at 3? which is the position we deduced? 

   And N at 2? correct.

   So we go with ""KNEAD"".

<guess>knead</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - C (absent), R (absent), A (present, wrong position), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position).  
2. **Guess 2 (""lanes""):**  
   - L (absent), A (present, wrong position), N (present, wrong position), E (present, wrong position), S (absent).  
3. **Guess 3 (""entia""):**  
   - E (present, wrong position), N (correct position), T (absent), I (absent), A (present, wrong position).  

### Deductions:
- **Absent Letters:** C, R, L, S, T, I (cannot be in the word).  
- **Present Letters:**  
  - **N** is confirmed at **position 2** (from ""entia"" feedback).  
  - **E** must be at **position 3** (ruled out positions 1, 4, 5 from all feedback; position 2 is taken by N).  
  - **A** must be at **position 1 or 4** (ruled out positions 2, 3, 5 from all feedback).  
- **Word Structure:**  
  - Position 2: **N** (fixed).  
  - Position 3: **E** (fixed).  
  - Positions 1 and 4: **A** must occupy one (either 1 or 4), and the other is a new letter.  
  - Position 5: A new letter (not A, since A can only be at 1 or 4).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **Option B** from deductions: **? N E A ?** (A at position 4).  
- Choose a valid word with:  
  - Position 1: New letter (not in absent list).  
  - Position 4: **A**.  
  - Position 5: New letter (not in absent list).  
- **""KNEAD""** fits perfectly:  
  - **K** (position 1, new letter),  
  - **N** (position 2, correct),  
  - **E** (position 3, correct),  
  - **A** (position 4, allowed),  
  - **D** (position 5, new letter).  
- **K** and **D** are common letters not ruled out.",Guess 4: knead -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) N(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
