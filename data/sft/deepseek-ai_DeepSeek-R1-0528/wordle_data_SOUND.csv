We are on the second guess. The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" was:
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

 This tells us:
 - N is in the word and in the correct position. That means the fourth letter of the secret word is N.
 - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Since R and A are common vowels, but they are not in the word, that helps.

 We know the secret word has N as the fourth letter: _ _ _ N _

 And the letters C, R, A, E are not in the word.

 Now, for the next guess, we need to:
 1. Include N in the fourth position.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, E.

 Also, we should try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Common English letters without C, R, A, E: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y.

 We have 6 tries, so we can afford to try more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that:
 - Has the fourth letter as N.
 - Does not contain C, R, A, E.
 - Uses some of the common letters like S, T, L, O, etc.

 Possibilities:
 We can try words like ""POINT"", ""JOINT"", ""MOUNT"", ""SOUND"", etc.

 But note: We also need to avoid the letters we know are absent.

 Let me try to form a word with distinct new letters to maximize information.

 Consider ""POINT"":
 P, O, I, N, T -> N is at the fourth position, and P, O, I, T are new.

 However, we don't know if these letters are in the word. Also, we must note that the secret word might have repeated letters, but we don't know yet.

 Alternatively, we can try ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T.

 Another idea: Since we know N is fixed at position 4, we can try to cover more vowels? The vowels we haven't tried are I, O, U. We know A and E are out.

 Let's consider ""POINT"":
 P, O, I, N, T -> all distinct and avoids C,R,A,E.

 That seems like a good candidate.

 Alternatively, ""LINTS"": but L, I, N, T, S -> but we don't know if we can use L, I, T, S. However, note that in position 4 we have N, so it must be _ _ _ N _. So ""LINTS"" would put S at the end.

 But we haven't tried S yet. Also, we have to avoid using the same letter multiple times if we are not sure? Actually, we can use letters multiple times if we don't know, but since the feedback says 'x' for letters not present, if a letter is repeated and one of them is correct, we might get mixed feedback. However, we don't have that in this case.

 Since we are trying to get information, using distinct letters is better.

 Let me go with ""POINT"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid English 5-letter word. ""POINT"" is valid.

 So my guess will be ""POINT"".

 But wait: the feedback from the first guess told us that N is in the correct position. In ""POINT"", we are putting N in the fourth position again, which is good because we know it belongs there. And we are testing P, O, I, T.

 Let's compare with another candidate: ""STOMP"" -> S, T, O, M, P. But this doesn't have N. We must have N in the fourth position because we know it's there. So this candidate is invalid because it doesn't place N at position 4.

 Therefore, I must choose a word that has N in the fourth position.

 Another candidate: ""BOUND"" -> B, O, U, N, D. This has N at position 4, and avoids C,R,A,E. But it has O and U which are vowels we haven't tried.

 However, ""POINT"" uses O and I which are also vowels. I think either is fine.

 But note that the word ""BOUND"" uses the letter O? Actually O is common.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SHUNT"": S, H, U, N, T -> avoids C,R,A,E and has N at position 4.

 However, I think ""POINT"" is a good word because it covers the vowel I and O, and common consonants P and T.

 Let me choose ""POINT"".

<guess>point</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (so the secret word has `_ _ _ N _`).
- **C, R, A, E** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).

For my second guess:
- Must include **N in the fourth position**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, E** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **P, O, I, T**) to gather more clues.

I chose **POINT** because:

So this candidate is invalid because it doesn\'t place N at position 4.\n\n Therefore, I must choose a word that has N in the fourth position.\n\n Another candidate: ""BOUND"" -> B, O, U, N, D. This has N at position 4, and avoids C,R,A,E. But it has O and U which are vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\n However, ""POINT"" uses O and I which are also vowels. I think either is fine.\n\n But note that the word ""BOUND"" uses the letter O? Actually O is common.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SHUNT"": S, H, U, N, T -> avoids C,R,A,E and has N at position 4.\n\n However, I think ""POINT"" is a good word because it covers the vowel I and O, and common consonants P and T.\n\n Let me choose ""POINT"".\n\n<guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **N** is correct and in the fourth position (so the secret word has `_ _ _ N _`).\n- **C, R, A, E** are absent (cannot appear anywhere).\n\nFor my second guess:\n- Must include **N in the fourth position**.\n- Avoid **C, R, A, E** entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **P, O, I, T**) to gather more clues.\n\nI chose **POINT** because:\n- It places **N** correctly in the fourth position.\n- It uses distinct new letters (**P, O, I, T**) to maximize information.\n- It tests additional vowels (**O, I**) and consonants (**P, T**), which are frequent in English words.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- N: correct and in position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- E: absent (x)

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct and in position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- I: absent (x)
- N: correct and in position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter) [we already knew this]
- T: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as O and the fourth letter as N. So the pattern is: _ O _ N _
- The absent letters are: C, R, A, E, P, I, T. (from both guesses)

We must avoid using these absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ O _ N _ and does not contain any of the absent letters.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried yet (from the alphabet, excluding the absent ones and including the known ones):

Known to be in the word: O (at position 1) and N (at position 3).

Absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, and we know O and N are in.

We need to form a 5-letter word: first letter (unknown), second letter O, third letter (unknown), fourth letter N, fifth letter (unknown).

We can try to use common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

- S O L N ? -> but we need a word that ends with a consonant? Actually, the fifth letter is unknown.

Let me think of words: 
- ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D -> but U is available, and D is available. However, we have to check if it avoids the absent letters. B, O, U, N, D: O and N are known, B, U, D are new. But note: in ""BOUND"", the fourth letter is N, which is correct, and second is O, correct. But we have to avoid I, T, etc. which we are. However, we haven't tried B, U, D.

But wait, the feedback from guess 2 said T is absent, so we cannot use T. But in ""BOUND"", there is no T, so it's okay.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Another word: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, similar to BOUND but with M.

But we might want to test more vowels? We know A, E, I are out, so only O and U are the vowels left? O is already placed, and U is available.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> S, U, D are new.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. S, U, D are not in the absent list.

Another possibility: ""HOUND"" -> H O U N D.

But we might also consider words that have different letters to cover more ground.

We also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to use distinct letters to get more information.

In ""SOUND"", we are testing S, U, D (and O and N are known). Similarly, ""BOUND"" tests B, U, D.

But we can try a word that doesn't use U? Because U is less common than S or L.

What about ""SOLON""? But SOLON has O at position 2 and N at position 4? Let's check: S O L O N -> but that has two O's? And the pattern is _ O _ N _, so SOLON: 
- Position 0: S
- Position 1: O (correct)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O? But we need position 3 to be N? No, position 3 is the fourth letter which must be N. In SOLON, position 3 is O, which is not N. So invalid.

Another word: ""BOWNS"" - but that might not be a word.

""YOWNS"" - also not common.

""GOWN"" is only 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

E is absent, so no.

""JUMPS"" -> but J is not very common, and we have to avoid U? No, U is allowed. But the pattern: J O ? N? -> no, because second letter must be O and fourth must be N. So ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

Let me list possible words:

Common words that fit _ O _ N _:

- BOUND
- FOUND
- HOUND
- MOUND
- POUND
- ROUND -> but R is absent! We cannot use R because it was absent in the first guess.
- SOUND
- WOUND

But R is absent, so ROUND is out.

Similarly, we have:

- BOUND: B, O, U, N, D
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D
- HOUND: H, O, U, N, D
- MOUND: M, O, U, N, D
- POUND: P, O, U, N, D -> but P is absent! From guess 2, P is absent. So we cannot use P.
- SOUND: S, O, U, N, D
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D

So POUND is out because P is absent.

Now, we also have:

- DONUT -> D O N U T -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.

- BONUS -> B O N U S -> but the pattern is _ O _ N _, so in BONUS: 
  Position 0: B
  Position 1: O (good)
  Position 2: N -> but we need position 3 to be N? No, position 2 is the third letter, and we need the fourth letter to be N. In BONUS, the fourth letter is U, not N. So it doesn't fit.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at index 3 (0-indexed).

So the words that work are the ones ending with ... N, but with the second letter O and fourth letter N? Actually, the pattern is:

Index 0: unknown
Index 1: O
Index 2: unknown
Index 3: N
Index 4: unknown

So the words I listed: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND all fit.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

We have not tried: B, F, H, M, S, W, U, D.

U and D are common to all these words. So we are going to test U and D no matter which we choose.

But we can choose which consonant to put at the beginning: B, F, H, M, S, W.

We should choose a letter that is more common to increase the chance of hitting.

In English, S is very common, so SOUND might be a good choice.

Also, S is a common starting letter.

Alternatively, we can avoid U? But we don't know if U is in the word. We have to test it.

But note: if we choose SOUND, we are testing S, U, D.

If we choose MOUND, we test M, U, D.

Similarly for others.

But we have multiple options, and we don't know which one is the secret word.

We can also consider less common words, but we should stick to common words.

Another word: ""JOINT"" -> but T is absent and I is absent, so no.

""GOONS"" -> G O O N S -> but the pattern: 
Index 0: G
Index 1: O (good)
Index 2: O -> but then index 3 must be N? In GOONS, index 3 is N? Let's see: G-O-O-N-S -> index 0: G, index1: O, index2: O, index3: N, index4: S. So it fits the pattern: _ O _ N _ -> actually, the third letter (index2) is O, and fourth (index3) is N. So it is G O O N S.

But we have two O's? And we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: G is available, O is known, N known, S available. And we avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

So GOONS is a possibility? But it has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's.

But in terms of feedback, if we guess GOONS:
- If the secret word has only one O, then the O at position 1 will be correct (✓), and the O at position 2 might be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? But if the word has only one O, then the second O (at index2) would be marked as absent because we already used the O in the correct position? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter. If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets '-', and if not in the word, 'x'. But if the word has only one O, and we have two O's in the guess, then the first O (at index1) is correct, so it gets ✓. The second O (at index2) would be absent because there is no second O, so it gets x.

But we don't know if the word has two O's.

Similarly, we can consider ""DOING"" -> but the pattern: D O I N G -> index1: O, index3: N? Index3 is I? No, index3 is the fourth letter? D (0), O(1), I(2), N(3), G(4). So index3 is N, which is correct. But I is absent (from guess2, I is absent), so we cannot use I. So ""DOING"" is invalid.

Back to GOONS: it uses G, O, O, N, S. We haven't tried G and S, and O and N are known. But we are using O twice. Since we don't know if the secret word has two O's, it might be a waste? But it could be.

Alternatively, we can avoid double letters for now to get clearer feedback.

So perhaps it's better to choose a word with distinct letters.

Among the words I listed, BOUND, FOUND, etc. all have distinct letters except that O and N are repeated? No, in BOUND: B, O, U, N, D -> all distinct.

Similarly, SOUND: S, O, U, N, D -> distinct.

So that's good.

Now, which one? Let's choose SOUND because S is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""SOUND"".

But note: we are trying to guess the word, and we have 6 tries. We are on the third try.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have U, to see if U is in the word? But we don't know, and we have to test it.

But if we choose a word without U, we might not get information about U.

But we have to form a word that fits the pattern and avoids absent letters.

Is there a word that fits _ O _ N _ without U?

For example, ""BONNY"" -> B O N N Y -> but the pattern: index0: B, index1: O, index2: N -> but then index3 must be N? In BONNY, index3 is N? B-O-N-N-Y: index0:B, index1:O, index2:N, index3:N, index4:Y. So the fourth letter (index3) is N, which is correct. But we have two N's? And we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, the second letter is O, good.

But the letters: B, O, N, N, Y. We avoid absent letters? B and Y are new, O and N known. But we are using N twice. And we don't know if the word has two N's.

But we can try. However, we are testing B and Y.

But Y is less common.

Another word: ""CONKY"" -> but C is absent.

""LONGS"" -> L O N G S -> pattern: L (0), O(1), N(2), G(3), S(4) -> but we need the fourth letter (index3) to be N, but here index3 is G, not N. So invalid.

""SONLY"" - not a word.

""DOGMA"" -> but pattern doesn't fit.

It seems that without U, it's hard to find common words.

""BOWNS"" is not common.

""YOWNS"" is a word (to yown means to howl), but uncommon.

So probably the common words are the ones with U: BOUND, FOUND, etc.

Therefore, I think SOUND is a good choice.

We'll test S, U, D.

If S is in the word, we'll know. Similarly for U and D.

So let's go with ""SOUND"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - From Guess 1 (""crane""):
     - **N** is correct and in the 4th position (so the secret word pattern is `_ _ _ N _`).
     - **C, R, A, E** are absent (not in the word at all).
   - From Guess 2 (""point""):
     - **O** is correct and in the 2nd position (updating the pattern to `_ O _ N _`).
     - **I** and **T** are absent (not in the word at all).
     - **P** is absent (not in the word at all).
     - **N** is confirmed again in the 4th position (no new info).
   - **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
   - **Correct and positioned letters**: **O** at position 2 (index 1), **N** at position 4 (index 3).

2. **Pattern to Match**:
   - The secret word must be 5 letters and follow the pattern: `_ O _ N _`.
   - Example: The 2nd letter is **O**, and the 4th letter is **N**.

3. **Available Letters**:
   - Letters not yet tested (and not absent): **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y**.
   - We need to test new common letters to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5 (index 0, 2, 4).

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **O** at position 2 and **N** at position 4.
   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, I, T).
   - Prioritize common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., **S, L, D, U, M, H**).
   - Ideal words: 5-letter words fitting `_ O _ N _` with distinct new letters to avoid redundancy.
   - Consider common English words like **SOUND**, **BOUND**, **FOUND**, **HOUND**, **MOUND**, or **WOUND** (all fit the pattern and avoid absent letters).

5. **Why ""SOUND""?**
   - Fits the pattern: **S** (position 1), **O** (position 2, correct), **U** (position 3), **N** (position 4, correct), **D** (position 5).
   - Tests new high-frequency letters: **S** (most common starting letter), **U** (vowel not yet tested), and **D** (common consonant).
   - Avoids absent letters and uses distinct characters for clear feedback.
   - If **S**, **U**, or **D** are in the word, feedback will reveal their positions or absence, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

6. **Alternatives Considered and Rejected**:
   - **BOUND/FOUND/HOUND/MOUND/WOUND**: Similar to SOUND but test less common starting letters (e.g., B, F, H, M, W). **S** is more frequent and provides better coverage.
   - Words without **U** (e.g., ""BONNY"" or ""LONGS""): Not ideal—**U** is a common vowel in this pattern, and avoiding it might miss key information. Most common `_ O _ N _` words include **U**.
   - Words with repeated letters (e.g., ""GOONS""): Risk redundant feedback and waste a guess, as we don't know if duplicates exist.

7. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Feedback on **S**, **U**, and **D** will help identify the full word. For example:
     - If **S** is correct, it might be at position 1.
     - If **U** is correct, it could be in position 3 or elsewhere.
     - If **D** is correct, it might be at position 5.

<guess>sound</guess>",sound,"We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- N: correct and in position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- E: absent (x)

From Guess 2 (""point""):
- P: absent (x)
- O: correct and in position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- I: absent (x)
- N: correct and in position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter) [we already knew this]
- T: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as O and the fourth letter as N. So the pattern is: _ O _ N _
- The absent letters are: C, R, A, E, P, I, T. (from both guesses)

We must avoid using these absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern _ O _ N _ and does not contain any of the absent letters.

Let's list the letters we haven't tried yet (from the alphabet, excluding the absent ones and including the known ones):

Known to be in the word: O (at position 1) and N (at position 3).

Absent: C, R, A, E, P, I, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y, and we know O and N are in.

We need to form a 5-letter word: first letter (unknown), second letter O, third letter (unknown), fourth letter N, fifth letter (unknown).

We can try to use common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters left: S, L, U, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern:

- S O L N ? -> but we need a word that ends with a consonant? Actually, the fifth letter is unknown.

Let me think of words: 
- ""BOUND"" -> B O U N D -> but U is available, and D is available. However, we have to check if it avoids the absent letters. B, O, U, N, D: O and N are known, B, U, D are new. But note: in ""BOUND"", the fourth letter is N, which is correct, and second is O, correct. But we have to avoid I, T, etc. which we are. However, we haven't tried B, U, D.

But wait, the feedback from guess 2 said T is absent, so we cannot use T. But in ""BOUND"", there is no T, so it's okay.

But let's see if there are better words that test more common letters.

Another word: ""MOUND"" -> M O U N D, similar to BOUND but with M.

But we might want to test more vowels? We know A, E, I are out, so only O and U are the vowels left? O is already placed, and U is available.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOUND"": S O U N D -> S, U, D are new.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. S, U, D are not in the absent list.

Another possibility: ""HOUND"" -> H O U N D.

But we might also consider words that have different letters to cover more ground.

We also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to use distinct letters to get more information.

In ""SOUND"", we are testing S, U, D (and O and N are known). Similarly, ""BOUND"" tests B, U, D.

But we can try a word that doesn't use U? Because U is less common than S or L.

What about ""SOLON""? But SOLON has O at position 2 and N at position 4? Let's check: S O L O N -> but that has two O's? And the pattern is _ O _ N _, so SOLON: 
- Position 0: S
- Position 1: O (correct)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O? But we need position 3 to be N? No, position 3 is the fourth letter which must be N. In SOLON, position 3 is O, which is not N. So invalid.

Another word: ""BOWNS"" - but that might not be a word.

""YOWNS"" - also not common.

""GOWN"" is only 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

E is absent, so no.

""JUMPS"" -> but J is not very common, and we have to avoid U? No, U is allowed. But the pattern: J O ? N? -> no, because second letter must be O and fourth must be N. So ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

Let me list possible words:

Common words that fit _ O _ N _:

- BOUND
- FOUND
- HOUND
- MOUND
- POUND
- ROUND -> but R is absent! We cannot use R because it was absent in the first guess.
- SOUND
- WOUND

But R is absent, so ROUND is out.

Similarly, we have:

- BOUND: B, O, U, N, D
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D
- HOUND: H, O, U, N, D
- MOUND: M, O, U, N, D
- POUND: P, O, U, N, D -> but P is absent! From guess 2, P is absent. So we cannot use P.
- SOUND: S, O, U, N, D
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D

So POUND is out because P is absent.

Now, we also have:

- DONUT -> D O N U T -> but T is absent, so we cannot use T.

- BONUS -> B O N U S -> but the pattern is _ O _ N _, so in BONUS: 
  Position 0: B
  Position 1: O (good)
  Position 2: N -> but we need position 3 to be N? No, position 2 is the third letter, and we need the fourth letter to be N. In BONUS, the fourth letter is U, not N. So it doesn't fit.

We need the fourth letter to be N, so the word must have N at index 3 (0-indexed).

So the words that work are the ones ending with ... N, but with the second letter O and fourth letter N? Actually, the pattern is:

Index 0: unknown
Index 1: O
Index 2: unknown
Index 3: N
Index 4: unknown

So the words I listed: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, SOUND, WOUND all fit.

Now, which one to choose? We want to test new letters.

We have not tried: B, F, H, M, S, W, U, D.

U and D are common to all these words. So we are going to test U and D no matter which we choose.

But we can choose which consonant to put at the beginning: B, F, H, M, S, W.

We should choose a letter that is more common to increase the chance of hitting.

In English, S is very common, so SOUND might be a good choice.

Also, S is a common starting letter.

Alternatively, we can avoid U? But we don't know if U is in the word. We have to test it.

But note: if we choose SOUND, we are testing S, U, D.

If we choose MOUND, we test M, U, D.

Similarly for others.

But we have multiple options, and we don't know which one is the secret word.

We can also consider less common words, but we should stick to common words.

Another word: ""JOINT"" -> but T is absent and I is absent, so no.

""GOONS"" -> G O O N S -> but the pattern: 
Index 0: G
Index 1: O (good)
Index 2: O -> but then index 3 must be N? In GOONS, index 3 is N? Let's see: G-O-O-N-S -> index 0: G, index1: O, index2: O, index3: N, index4: S. So it fits the pattern: _ O _ N _ -> actually, the third letter (index2) is O, and fourth (index3) is N. So it is G O O N S.

But we have two O's? And we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, we have to avoid absent letters: G is available, O is known, N known, S available. And we avoid C,R,A,E,P,I,T.

So GOONS is a possibility? But it has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's.

But in terms of feedback, if we guess GOONS:
- If the secret word has only one O, then the O at position 1 will be correct (✓), and the O at position 2 might be marked as absent (x) or wrong position? But if the word has only one O, then the second O (at index2) would be marked as absent because we already used the O in the correct position? Actually, no: the feedback is per letter. If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets '-', and if not in the word, 'x'. But if the word has only one O, and we have two O's in the guess, then the first O (at index1) is correct, so it gets ✓. The second O (at index2) would be absent because there is no second O, so it gets x.

But we don't know if the word has two O's.

Similarly, we can consider ""DOING"" -> but the pattern: D O I N G -> index1: O, index3: N? Index3 is I? No, index3 is the fourth letter? D (0), O(1), I(2), N(3), G(4). So index3 is N, which is correct. But I is absent (from guess2, I is absent), so we cannot use I. So ""DOING"" is invalid.

Back to GOONS: it uses G, O, O, N, S. We haven't tried G and S, and O and N are known. But we are using O twice. Since we don't know if the secret word has two O's, it might be a waste? But it could be.

Alternatively, we can avoid double letters for now to get clearer feedback.

So perhaps it's better to choose a word with distinct letters.

Among the words I listed, BOUND, FOUND, etc. all have distinct letters except that O and N are repeated? No, in BOUND: B, O, U, N, D -> all distinct.

Similarly, SOUND: S, O, U, N, D -> distinct.

So that's good.

Now, which one? Let's choose SOUND because S is a very common letter.

So I'll go with ""SOUND"".

But note: we are trying to guess the word, and we have 6 tries. We are on the third try.

But if we choose a word without U, we might not get information about U.

But we have to form a word that fits the pattern and avoids absent letters.

Is there a word that fits _ O _ N _ without U?

For example, ""BONNY"" -> B O N N Y -> but the pattern: index0: B, index1: O, index2: N -> but then index3 must be N? In BONNY, index3 is N? B-O-N-N-Y: index0:B, index1:O, index2:N, index3:N, index4:Y. So the fourth letter (index3) is N, which is correct. But we have two N's? And we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, the second letter is O, good.

But the letters: B, O, N, N, Y. We avoid absent letters? B and Y are new, O and N known. But we are using N twice. And we don't know if the word has two N's.

But Y is less common.

Another word: ""CONKY"" -> but C is absent.

""LONGS"" -> L O N G S -> pattern: L (0), O(1), N(2), G(3), S(4) -> but we need the fourth letter (index3) to be N, but here index3 is G, not N. So invalid.

""SONLY"" - not a word.

""DOGMA"" -> but pattern doesn't fit.

It seems that without U, it's hard to find common words.

""BOWNS"" is not common.

""YOWNS"" is a word (to yown means to howl), but uncommon.

So probably the common words are the ones with U: BOUND, FOUND, etc.

Therefore, I think SOUND is a good choice.

We'll test S, U, D.

If S is in the word, we'll know. Similarly for U and D.

So let's go with ""SOUND"".

<guess>sound</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - From Guess 1 (""crane""):
     - **N** is correct and in the 4th position (so the secret word pattern is `_ _ _ N _`).
     - **C, R, A, E** are absent (not in the word at all).
   - From Guess 2 (""point""):
     - **O** is correct and in the 2nd position (updating the pattern to `_ O _ N _`).
     - **I** and **T** are absent (not in the word at all).
     - **P** is absent (not in the word at all).
     - **N** is confirmed again in the 4th position (no new info).
   - **Absent letters so far**: C, R, A, E, P, I, T (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
   - **Correct and positioned letters**: **O** at position 2 (index 1), **N** at position 4 (index 3).

2. **Pattern to Match**:
   - The secret word must be 5 letters and follow the pattern: `_ O _ N _`.
   - Example: The 2nd letter is **O**, and the 4th letter is **N**.

3. **Available Letters**:
   - Letters not yet tested (and not absent): **B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, V, W, Y**.
   - We need to test new common letters to gather more information, especially for positions 1, 3, and 5 (index 0, 2, 4).

4. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **O** at position 2 and **N** at position 4.
   - Avoid all absent letters (C, R, A, E, P, I, T).
   - Prioritize common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., **S, L, D, U, M, H**).
   - Ideal words: 5-letter words fitting `_ O _ N _` with distinct new letters to avoid redundancy.
   - Consider common English words like **SOUND**, **BOUND**, **FOUND**, **HOUND**, **MOUND**, or **WOUND** (all fit the pattern and avoid absent letters).

5. **Why ""SOUND""?**
   - Fits the pattern: **S** (position 1), **O** (position 2, correct), **U** (position 3), **N** (position 4, correct), **D** (position 5).
   - Tests new high-frequency letters: **S** (most common starting letter), **U** (vowel not yet tested), and **D** (common consonant).
   - Avoids absent letters and uses distinct characters for clear feedback.
   - If **S**, **U**, or **D** are in the word, feedback will reveal their positions or absence, narrowing down possibilities significantly.

6. **Alternatives Considered and Rejected**:
   - **BOUND/FOUND/HOUND/MOUND/WOUND**: Similar to SOUND but test less common starting letters (e.g., B, F, H, M, W). **S** is more frequent and provides better coverage.
   - Words without **U** (e.g., ""BONNY"" or ""LONGS""): Not ideal—**U** is a common vowel in this pattern, and avoiding it might miss key information. Most common `_ O _ N _` words include **U**.
   - Words with repeated letters (e.g., ""GOONS""): Risk redundant feedback and waste a guess, as we don't know if duplicates exist.

7. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Feedback on **S**, **U**, and **D** will help identify the full word. For example:
     - If **S** is correct, it might be at position 1.
     - If **U** is correct, it could be in position 3 or elsewhere.
     - If **D** is correct, it might be at position 5.",Guess 3: sound -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) U(✓) N(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
