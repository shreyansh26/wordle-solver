We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Since we have only one correct letter (R) and it's in the second position, we need to make a new guess that includes R in the second position and avoids the letters C, A, N, E.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Possible letters to consider: We can use letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, A, N, E).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and the second one is R.

Let's think of words that have R as the second letter and use other common letters.

Some examples:
- BR (like BRICK, BRISK, etc.) but we don't know the other letters.
- We can try a word that has multiple common letters to test.

Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate might be ""PRISM"" but note that we have to avoid A, C, N, E. P, R, I, S, M are all allowed.

But let's check: 
- P: not used before
- R: we know it's in the second position, so we put R in the second position again.
- I: new
- S: new
- M: new

Alternatively, we can try ""TRYST"" but that has T repeated and Y is less common.

Another common word: ""BROAD"" but A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, so ""BROAD"" is invalid because of A.

Another word: ""FRUIT"" but U and I are new, but we have R in second position? F-R-U-I-T: that would be F as first, R as second, then U, I, T.

But we don't know if F is in the word.

We can also consider ""DRINK"" but D is new, R in second, I, N is excluded (we cannot use N) and K. But N is excluded, so we cannot use ""DRINK"".

We must avoid N, so that's out.

Another word: ""PRICK"" - P, R, I, C, K. But C is excluded (from the first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

Similarly, we cannot use any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, E.

So, let's list the constraints:
- Second letter must be R.
- The word must not contain C, A, N, E.
- We want to test new common letters.

I am considering ""PRISM"": 
- P: not excluded
- R: in second position (so we use it as the second letter)
- I: not excluded
- S: not excluded
- M: not excluded

But note: in ""PRISM"", the R is in the second position, which is correct.

Alternatively, ""BRISK"": 
- B: not excluded
- R: second
- I: not excluded
- S: not excluded
- K: not excluded

But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

However, we have to choose one. Since we are in the second guess, we can choose a word that covers more vowels? We know that A and E are out, so the vowel might be I, O, or U.

We haven't tested O or U yet.

Another word: ""GROUP"" - G, R, O, U, P. But that has O and U, which are new.

But note: in ""GROUP"", the R is the second letter? G-R-O-U-P: yes, second is R.

But we have to see if it's a valid word.

Alternatively, ""TROUP"" is not common, so maybe ""GROUP"" is better.

But let's think of more common words.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and the vowel I.

Another one: ""TRIPS"" - T, R, I, P, S. That also has R in second position.

We can choose any of these.

I'll go with ""PRISM"" because it has distinct letters and covers P, R, I, S, M.

So, the next guess: PRISM

But note: we are not sure if P is the first letter, but we are testing.

We can also consider ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H. That has U and H, which are new.

But I think ""PRISM"" is fine.

Alternatively, to cover a different set, we can try ""ROBOT"" but R is the first letter? We need R as the second letter. So ""ROBOT"" has R as the first, which is not what we want.

We must have R as the second letter.

So, the word must be of the form _ R _ _ _

We have to fill the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, A, N, E.

Let me think of a word that uses common letters and has R in the second position.

Some options:
- DRIVE (D, R, I, V, E) but E is excluded -> invalid.
- FRUIT (F, R, U, I, T) -> valid, and we test F, U, I, T.
- GRIME (G, R, I, M, E) -> E is excluded, invalid.
- PRICE (P, R, I, C, E) -> C and E excluded, invalid.
- BRINE (B, R, I, N, E) -> N and E excluded, invalid.

So, ""FRUIT"" is a valid option: F, R, U, I, T.

Another: ""CRISP"" -> C is excluded, invalid.

""TRIPS"": T, R, I, P, S -> valid.

""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> valid.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> valid.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> E excluded, invalid.

""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> valid.

""GRASP"": G, R, A, S, P -> A excluded, invalid.

So, we have several options: FRUIT, TRIPS, PRISM, BRISK, DRIFT, etc.

I think I'll go with ""TRIPS"" because it has T, R, I, P, S, which are common and we haven't tested T, I, P, S yet.

But note: in the first guess we tested R and it was correct, so we are reusing R in the correct position.

So, let's choose ""TRIPS"".

But ""TRIPS"" has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"" has M at the end.

I think both are fine.

I'll choose ""TRIPS"" for the second guess.

But let me confirm: T-R-I-P-S.

Yes.

So, the next guess is ""TRIPS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

For the next guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter.
- It must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, I'll choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., T, I, P, S) to test new positions.

A suitable guess is ""TRIPS"", which:
- Places R in the second position (as required).
- Uses new letters T, I, P, S (all not ruled out).

I think I'll go with ""TRIPS"" because it has T, R, I, P, S, which are common and we haven't tested T, I, P, S yet.

But note: in the first guess we tested R and it was correct, so we are reusing R in the correct position.

So, let's choose ""TRIPS"".

But ""TRIPS"" has S at the end, which is common.

Alternatively, ""PRISM"" has M at the end.

I think both are fine.

I'll choose ""TRIPS"" for the second guess.

But let me confirm: T-R-I-P-S.

Yes.

So, the next guess is ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).

For the next guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter.
- It must avoid the letters C, A, N, E.
- To maximize information, I'll choose a word with common unused letters (e.g., T, I, P, S) to test new positions.

A suitable guess is ""TRIPS"", which:
- Places R in the second position (as required).
- Uses new letters T, I, P, S (all not ruled out).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

We have feedback from the first two guesses:

From Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Thus, we know:
- Position 2 is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are absent in the word.

From Guess 2: TRIPS
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position 2, which we already know)
- I: x (not in word)
- P: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)

So, now we also know:
- T, I, S are not in the word (since they are marked x).
- P is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed in position 4 and marked with dash, meaning wrong position).

Therefore, the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

Present letters so far: R (fixed in position 2) and P (somewhere, but not position 4).

The word has exactly five letters, so we know:
- Position 2: R
- P must be in one of the following positions: 1, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).
- We must avoid using C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

List of available letters: We can use the remaining consonants and vowels not excluded. The excluded letters are: C, A, E, N, T, I, S.

Include all letters except: A, C, E, I, N, S, T.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P (already known), Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note, P is already known to be in the word.

The word is of the form: _ R _ _ _ 

We know P is in the word but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern and uses only the available letters.

Let's try to think of words that have R in position 2 and P somewhere else.

Possible positions for P:

Case 1: P in position 1 -> P R _ _ _
Case 2: P in position 3 -> _ R P _ _
Case 3: P in position 5 -> _ R _ _ P

Now, we have to fill the blanks without using the excluded letters.

Let's consider each case.

Case 1: P R _ _ _
The word starts with PR, and we need three more letters from available set: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Also, the word must exist. Examples: PROUD (but O and U are available, D is available), but let's see if we can test more letters.

We already know P is present, but if P is in position 1, we can test other positions.

Case 2: _ R P _ _ 
Examples: WRAPS (but A and S excluded), not valid. Other: GRIPS, but I and S excluded. We need words without excluded letters.

Case 3: _ R _ _ P 
Examples: CROUP (C excluded), DROOP (O and P? But O is available, D available), or GROUP (G, R, O, U, P) but note GROUP: positions - G, R, O, U, P -> so R in 2, P in 5? Yes, and O and U are available.

But let's be systematic.

Our goal is to guess a word that tests new letters while satisfying the known constraints.

We know P is present and must be in 1, 3, or 5.

We should avoid using P in position 4 as we know it's wrong, but we might place it in a different position.

Since we have only two known present letters (R and P), and we have three positions to fill (1,3,5) with P possibly in one of them.

We can try to find a word that has P in one of those positions and introduces three new letters from the available set.

But we have limited guesses left.

Currently, we have 4 guesses remaining (since we used 2 out of 6).

Let's think of specific words:

Option for P in position 1: PR words.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> O, U, D are available.
- PROWL: P R O W L -> O, W, L available. 
- PROOF: P R O O F -> O, O, F. But duplicate O.
- PRONG: P R O N G -> N is excluded! Invalid.
- PROUD seems valid.

But note we haven't tested O, U, D, etc.

Option for P in position 3: words where position 3 is P.
- _ R P _ _
What words? E.g., WORPS? Not a word. CARPI? C excluded.
Valid words: HORPY? Not a word. We need common words.
Perhaps DRUPE? D, R, U, P, E -> but E excluded.
Maybe GROUP? No, in GROUP, P is last.

In fact, GROUP has P in position 5: positions 1:G, 2:R, 3:O, 4:U, 5:P.

For position 3: P? We need like _ R P _ _

Examples: GRIPS (G,R,I,P,S) but I and S excluded -> invalid.
CRISP -> C and S excluded.
TRIPS -> T,I,S excluded -> invalid (we guessed TRIPS).
WRAPS -> W,R,A,P,S -> A and S excluded -> invalid.
Perhaps BROMP? Not a word.

It might be hard to find common words with P in position 3 and avoiding the exclusions.

Option for P in position 5: _ R _ _ P
Examples:
- GROUP: G R O U P -> G, O, U are available.
- DROOP: D R O O P -> D, O, O. Duplicate O but valid.
- DROMP? Not a word.
- CROUP -> C excluded.
- TROUP? Not standard.
- So GROUP and DROOP are candidates.

Additionally, PROUD (which has P in position 1).

We also haven't tested many vowels. Since A, E, I are excluded (from Guess 1 and Guess 2), the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we should test O or U.

Considering the feedback, we have only one letter known besides R: P.

In GROUP: If we guess GROUP, it would be G, R, O, U, P.
- This tests G, O, U, and places P in position 5. We might get feedback on whether P is indeed at position 5.

But from the feedback of Guess 2, P was marked with dash (wrong position) when guessed at position 4, so if we put P at position 5 and it's correct, we get ✓, else if it's elsewhere, we get -.

Similarly, PROUD tests P at position 1.

To decide: We want to maximize information. Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have P in position 4 (which we tried) and puts it in another position to confirm.

Since P cannot be in position 4, and we have positions 1,3,5, let's try position 5.

Therefore, I propose guessing ""GROUP"".

However, in GROUP, we have O and U, which haven't been tested.

Another word: ""PROUD"" tests P at 1 and O,U,D.

But we know P is in the word, so if we put P in position 1 and it's correct, we get ✓; if not, we get -.

Both GROUP and PROUD are good.

Let's list words that are valid:
- With P in 1: PROUD, PROWL, PROXY (but X not common), PROFS? Not a word. So PROUD is good.
- With P in 5: GROUP, DROOP, and maybe ""TROMP"" but not common, so GROUP is better.

GROUP and PROUD both test multiple new letters.

But note: in GROUP, if P is actually in position 1, we might not test that scenario well.

On the other hand, if we guess PROUD, we test P at position 1.

Given that we don't know where P is, we can choose one arbitrarily.

I think GROUP is a good choice because:
- It places P at the end, which if correct, we get direct hit; if not, we know P is not at position 5 and must be at position 1 or 3.
- It tests two new vowels: O and U.

Similarly, PROUD tests P at 1 and O,U,D.

But D might be less common.

I'll go with GROUP for more common usage.

So next guess: GROUP

But let's confirm if ""GROUP"" is valid: yes, meaning a set or gathering.

Feedback will tell us:
- G: if in word and position
- R: should be correct
- O: if in word and position
- U: if in word and position
- P: if in word and position (we expect either dash if P is elsewhere, or ✓ if at position 5)

So we can get more information.

Therefore, guess: GROUP
</think>
After reviewing the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - This confirms R is in the word and in position 2.
  - Letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TRIPS** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)  
  - R is correctly placed at position 2 again (as expected).
  - P is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
  - Letters T, I, S are not in the word.

### Key deductions:
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is fixed at position 2.
  - P is in the word but not in position 4. It must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), plus T, I, S (from Guess 2). 
- **Available letters for new guess**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).
- **Word pattern**: `_ R _ _ _ `, with P requiring placement in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Goal**: Choose a word that maximizes information by testing the possible positions for P and introducing new common letters (e.g., vowels like O/U).

### Choice of word:
- **GROUP** is selected as the next guess because:
  - It places R in position 2 (correct).
  - It places P in position 5, testing if P is correctly positioned here or providing feedback (dash if P is elsewhere, i.e., position 1 or 3).
  - It introduces new common letters: G (position 1), O (position 3), U (position 4)—all untested and available.
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, E, T, I, S).
  - As a valid English word, it adheres to game rules.
- Alternative considered: PROUD, but GROUP was favored for balanced vowel/consonant testing.

This guess aims to clarify P's position and uncover new letters efficiently.

<guess>GROUP</guess>",GROUP,"We have feedback from the first two guesses:

I think GROUP is a good choice because:
- It places P at the end, which if correct, we get direct hit; if not, we know P is not at position 5 and must be at position 1 or 3.
- It tests two new vowels: O and U.

Similarly, PROUD tests P at 1 and O,U,D.

But D might be less common.

I'll go with GROUP for more common usage.

So next guess: GROUP

But let's confirm if ""GROUP"" is valid: yes, meaning a set or gathering.

Feedback will tell us:
- G: if in word and position
- R: should be correct
- O: if in word and position
- U: if in word and position
- P: if in word and position (we expect either dash if P is elsewhere, or ✓ if at position 5)

So we can get more information.

Therefore, guess: GROUPAfter reviewing the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - This confirms R is in the word and in position 2.
  - Letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: TRIPS** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)  
  - R is correctly placed at position 2 again (as expected).
  - P is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
  - Letters T, I, S are not in the word.

### Key deductions:
- **Present letters**: 
  - R is fixed at position 2.
  - P is in the word but not in position 4. It must be in one of the remaining positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from Guess 1), plus T, I, S (from Guess 2). 
- **Available letters for new guess**: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).
- **Word pattern**: `_ R _ _ _ `, with P requiring placement in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Goal**: Choose a word that maximizes information by testing the possible positions for P and introducing new common letters (e.g., vowels like O/U).

### Choice of word:
- **GROUP** is selected as the next guess because:
  - It places R in position 2 (correct).
  - It places P in position 5, testing if P is correctly positioned here or providing feedback (dash if P is elsewhere, i.e., position 1 or 3).
  - It introduces new common letters: G (position 1), O (position 3), U (position 4)—all untested and available.
  - It avoids all excluded letters (C, A, N, E, T, I, S).
  - As a valid English word, it adheres to game rules.
- Alternative considered: PROUD, but GROUP was favored for balanced vowel/consonant testing.

This guess aims to clarify P's position and uncover new letters efficiently.",Guess 3: GROUP -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) O(✓) U(✓) P(✓),SUCCESS
