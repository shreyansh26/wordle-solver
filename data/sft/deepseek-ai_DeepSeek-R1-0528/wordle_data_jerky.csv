We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x -> not in the secret word
R: - -> R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the second letter)
A: x -> not in the secret word
N: x -> not in the secret word
E: - -> E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it as the fifth letter)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The secret word does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Our next guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include R and E (because they are present).
- Exclude C, A, N (because they are absent).
- We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Also, note that the positions for R and E are not fixed:
- R cannot be in position 2 (the second letter).
- E cannot be in position 5 (the last letter).

We must avoid placing R in the second position and E in the fifth position in our guess, because we know they don't belong there.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common consonants we haven't tried: T, S, L, D, etc.

A good approach is to try a word that has R and E, and also other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L.

Example words:
- ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but note we are avoiding A and N, and this doesn't include C,A,N.
  Let's check: T, R, I, E, S. None of these are C,A,N.

But we must also avoid placing R in position 2? Actually, in ""TRIES"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong for the secret word. However, in our guess, we can still put R in position 2 to test? Actually, we can, but we already know that the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we will get a '-' again? Actually, wait: the feedback tells us about the secret word. Since we know R isn't in position 2, we can avoid that.

Better to put R in a different position. We want to test R in other positions.

Similarly, we know E isn't at the end, so avoid putting E at the end.

Possible words:

Option: ""ROGUE"": R at position 1, which we haven't tested? But note: in ""crane"", we had R at position 2. Now we can try R at position 1? Also E at position 5? But wait: we know E shouldn't be at position 5? So avoid E at position 5.

So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.

Another: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D
- Positions: R at 3, E at 4. This avoids R at position 2 and E at position 5.
- Letters: T, I, R, E, D -> no C, A, N.

This seems good because we test T, I, D as new letters.

Another option: ""STREW"" -> S, T, R, E, W -> but note E is at position 4? Actually: positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), E (4), W (5). But E is at position 4? That's okay because we don't know about position 4. And W is new.

But in the secret word, we know E is present but not at position 5. Position 4 might be possible.

Also, note that in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning it's elsewhere. So trying R at position 3 is a new position.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got '-', so trying E at position 4 is a new position.

So let's consider ""TIRED"":

Why ""TIRED""? It tests R at position 3 and E at position 4, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is less common and we haven't tested Q. Also, U. Maybe not optimal because we want to test common letters.

Another idea: ""RESET""? But that has duplicate E? Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. It's possible, but let's avoid for simplicity.

Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word. But in our case, we don't have feedback about duplicates.

Another word: ""TERSE"" -> has E twice? Also, E at the end? Avoid the end for E.

Actually, ""TERSE"" ends with E, which we know is wrong? So avoid.

So back to ""TIRED"". Let me confirm it's a valid word: tired (exhausted). Yes.

We can test:

- T in position 1: if in secret, is it correct?
- I in position 2: new letter
- R in position 3: we know R is in the word, so we see if it's at position 3?
- E in position 4: we know E is in the word, see if it's at position 4?
- D in position 5: new letter.

This should give us new information.

Alternatively, another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Positions: S1, T2, O3, R4? No: STORE has R at position 4 and E at position 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? So avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5? But N is absent! We know N is not in the word. Our feedback said N(x). So we cannot use N. So avoid ""STERN"".

Another: ""DRIVE""? D1, R2, I3, V4, E5 -> E at position 5: avoid.

""RIDER""? Duplicate R? And we might not know about duplicates? Also, E is missing? We must include E because we know E is present. So ""RIDER"" doesn't have E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, no: we are allowed to guess words that don't have E? But we know E is present? Actually, the rules don't force us to include every known letter, but it's inefficient to leave out a known letter. Because if we don't test E again, we don't get information about its position. So we should include E.

Therefore, let's go with ""TIRED"".

So next guess: TIRED

But note: we are avoiding placing R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in any position except maybe we get more information? In ""TIRED"", R is in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4, avoiding position 5.

So I think that's good.

Another possibility: ""GRIME"" -> G1, R2? R in position 2: we know R is not at position 2? So if we put R in position 2, we will get '-' for R? But actually, we already know it's not there, so we can avoid wasting that. Also, ""GRIME"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""TIRED"" seems acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, N. ""TIRED"" has T, I, R, E, D -> none of those are C,A,N. So that's safe.

So the next guess is ""TIRED"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are absent in the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, N (absent letters).
- Avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
- Use new common letters like T, I, D to gather information about other positions in the word.

I selected ""TIRED"" because:
- It includes R and E, with R in position 3 and E in position 4 (both untested positions).
- It uses new letters: T, I, D, which are common and could provide useful feedback.
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, A, N) and avoids placing E in position 5.

This should give us new information.

Alternatively, another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Positions: S1, T2, O3, R4? No: STORE has R at position 4 and E at position 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? So avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5? But N is absent! We know N is not in the word. Our feedback said N(x). So we cannot use N. So avoid ""STERN"".

Another: ""DRIVE""? D1, R2, I3, V4, E5 -> E at position 5: avoid.

""RIDER""? Duplicate R? And we might not know about duplicates? Also, E is missing? We must include E because we know E is present. So ""RIDER"" doesn't have E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, no: we are allowed to guess words that don't have E? But we know E is present? Actually, the rules don't force us to include every known letter, but it's inefficient to leave out a known letter. Because if we don't test E again, we don't get information about its position. So we should include E.

Therefore, let's go with ""TIRED"".

So next guess: TIRED

But note: we are avoiding placing R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in any position except maybe we get more information? In ""TIRED"", R is in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4, avoiding position 5.

So I think that's good.

Another possibility: ""GRIME"" -> G1, R2? R in position 2: we know R is not at position 2? So if we put R in position 2, we will get '-' for R? But actually, we already know it's not there, so we can avoid wasting that. Also, ""GRIME"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""TIRED"" seems acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, N. ""TIRED"" has T, I, R, E, D -> none of those are C,A,N. So that's safe.

So the next guess is ""TIRED"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are absent in the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, N (absent letters).
- Avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
- Use new common letters like T, I, D to gather information about other positions in the word.

I selected ""TIRED"" because:
- It includes R and E, with R in position 3 and E in position 4 (both untested positions).
- It uses new letters: T, I, D, which are common and could provide useful feedback.
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, A, N) and avoids placing E in position 5.

None of these are C,A,N.\n\nBut we must also avoid placing R in position 2? Actually, in ""TRIES"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong for the secret word. However, in our guess, we can still put R in position 2 to test? Actually, we can, but we already know that the secret word doesn\'t have R in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we will get a \'-\' again? Actually, wait: the feedback tells us about the secret word. Since we know R isn\'t in position 2, we can avoid that.\n\nBetter to put R in a different position. We want to test R in other positions.\n\nSimilarly, we know E isn\'t at the end, so avoid putting E at the end.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: ""ROGUE"": R at position 1, which we haven\'t tested? But note: in ""crane"", we had R at position 2. Now we can try R at position 1? Also E at position 5? But wait: we know E shouldn\'t be at position 5? So avoid E at position 5.\n\nSo ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\nAnother: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D\n- Positions: R at 3, E at 4. This avoids R at position 2 and E at position 5.\n- Letters: T, I, R, E, D -> no C, A, N.\n\nThis seems good because we test T, I, D as new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""STREW"" -> S, T, R, E, W -> but note E is at position 4? Actually: positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), E (4), W (5). But E is at position 4? That\'s okay because we don\'t know about position 4. And W is new.\n\nBut in the secret word, we know E is present but not at position 5. Position 4 might be possible.\n\nAlso, note that in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning it\'s elsewhere. So trying R at position 3 is a new position.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 and got \'-\', so trying E at position 4 is a new position.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""TIRED"":\n\nWhy ""TIRED""? It tests R at position 3 and E at position 4, which are positions we haven\'t tried for these letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is less common and we haven\'t tested Q. Also, U. Maybe not optimal because we want to test common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""RESET""? But that has duplicate E? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. It\'s possible, but let\'s avoid for simplicity.\n\nActually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates unless they are in the word. But in our case, we don\'t have feedback about duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""TERSE"" -> has E twice? Also, E at the end? Avoid the end for E.\n\nActually, ""TERSE"" ends with E, which we know is wrong? So avoid.\n\nSo back to ""TIRED"". Let me confirm it\'s a valid word: tired (exhausted). Yes.\n\nWe can test:\n\n- T in position 1: if in secret, is it correct?\n- I in position 2: new letter\n- R in position 3: we know R is in the word, so we see if it\'s at position 3?\n- E in position 4: we know E is in the word, see if it\'s at position 4?\n- D in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis should give us new information.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Positions: S1, T2, O3, R4? No: STORE has R at position 4 and E at position 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? So avoid.\n\nHow about ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5? But N is absent!

We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess ""crane"": 
   C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   Meaning:
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess ""tired"":
   T(x), I(x), R(✓), E(-), D(x)
   Meaning:
      - T, I, D are not in the word -> added to absent letters.
      - R is correct at position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3 and got ✓).
      - E is in the word (we knew this) but not in position 4 (since we guessed in position 4 and got -).

So, what we know:
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, D
- Present letters: R and E, with R fixed at position 3.
- R is in position 3 (confirmed).
- E is present but not in positions 4 (from ""tired"") or 5 (from ""crane"").

Therefore, the secret word must have:
   _ _ R _ _

And E must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, or possibly 4? But wait:
From ""tired"": E in position 4 got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 4.
Similarly, from ""crane"": E in position 5 got '-', meaning E is not in position 5.

So positions for E: only 1 or 2 are possible? Because positions 3 is taken by R? So E cannot be in position 3? Because R is fixed at position 3.

Available positions for E: 1 or 2.

We must also account for the fact that E might appear only once? But we don't know. We only know at least one E is present.

But in any case, for position 1 or 2.

Therefore, the word has the form:
   Position 1: ? or E
   Position 2: ? or E (if E is in position 1, then position 2 cannot be E; but wait, duplicates are possible? But we haven't ruled out duplicates)
   Position 3: R (fixed)
   Position 4: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""tired"")
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""crane"")

But note: E must be in the word, so either position 1 or 2 must be E? Or could E be duplicated? If E is duplicated, then one E could be in position 1 or 2, and the other in another position? But we have excluded positions 4 and 5? Actually, we only know that the E we guessed in position 4 wasn't correct? And at position 5 wasn't correct? But if the word has two E's, then one could be elsewhere? However, we have no feedback indicating duplicates? So we must consider that E might be only one occurrence? But to be safe, we should not rule out duplicates.

However, since we got '-' for E only when guessed in position 4 and 5, meaning that E is not in position 4 and not in position 5? But position 3 is R? So actually, E must be in position 1 or 2? Because if E were in position 4 or 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for one of those? Actually no: if the word has two E's, then E might be in other positions? But let's see the feedback: 

In ""crane"" we guessed E at position 5, and got '-', meaning that E is present but not at position 5? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Similarly, in ""tired"", E at position 4 got '-', meaning E is present but not at position 4? But if the word has an E in position 4, then we would have gotten ✓? So we know the word does not have E in position 4? Similarly not in position 5? And position 3 is R? So E must be in position 1 or 2? Unless the word has duplicates and E is in position 1, 2 and maybe another? But positions 4 and 5 are excluded? So only positions 1, 2 are available? And position 3 is taken by R? So the remaining positions for E are 1 and 2? Therefore, we are safe to assume that E is at position 1 or 2? Actually, yes.

Therefore, the word must be of the form:
   Position 1: E or not? But E must be in 1 or 2? So two cases:
   Case 1: E at position 1 -> E _ R _ _
   Case 2: E at position 2 -> _ E R _ _

But also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,T,I,D

So available letters? We know only R and E so far? And we have 5 positions? So we need three more letters? They must be from the remaining alphabet minus absent ones.

Absent: C,A,N,T,I,D -> so we avoid: C, A, N, T, I, D.

The word must contain E and R? And three other letters not from {C,A,N,T,I,D}.

Also, remember that R is fixed at position 3? And E is at position 1 or 2.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test which position E is in? And reveal other letters? We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases.

Also, we want to test new common letters: like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc? Because we haven't used S, L, O, etc.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 1 or 2? We can try to include both possibilities? Or we can choose a word that fits one case? But we don't know which case? So maybe try a word that has E in position 1? That will tell us: if E is at position 1? Or if we get '-' then E must be at position 2? Because if we guess E at position 1 and it's correct, we get ✓? If we get '-' that means E is in the word but not there? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only options? Similarly, if we guess E at position 2? We can get either ✓ or '-'? But if we get ✓? Then position 2 is E? If '-' then position 1 must be E? Because it's the only alternative.

So we can design a guess to pin down E's position.

Also, we want to introduce new letters? So let's try common letters: B, S, L, O, P, etc.

Let me think of words that:
- Have R at position 3 (fixed)
- Have E either at position 1 or 2? But we haven't decided? So we can try:

Option: place E at position 1 and see what happens? Then the word form: E _ R _ _

For example, ""E _ R S _ ""? or whatever.

We can also consider: which letters are common? We need to test more consonants.

Let's list available common vowels and consonants:
Vowels: E (we have), and we might have O, U? But we haven't tried? Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? But need common.

Good common letters: S, L, O, U, M, P, K, etc.

Now, we can form words:

If we want to test E at position 1? For example: ""ES__R""? Wait, R is at position 3? So pattern: E _ R _ _

Example: ""EBONY"" but B and N? N is absent? Also Y? But we know N absent? Avoid.

Another: ""EMBER"": E, M, B, E, R? Wait this has E at position 1 and position 4? But position 4? We know E cannot be at position 4 (from ""tired"" feedback)? So even if we guessed, it would be wrong? Also, duplicate E? And B is new? But let's see: ""EMBER"" would be E at 1, R at 5? But we need R at position 3? So not possible? Because it would place R at position 5? But our structure is _ _ R _ _? So position 3 must be R? Therefore, any guess must have R in position 3? So ""EMBER"" doesn't fit because it's E,M,B,E,R -> positions: E1, M2, B3, E4, R5? So at position 3? B? But we need R? So no? We must have R at position 3.

Therefore, our guess must have R at position 3? So pattern: _ _ R _ _

And for E: we want to test position 1? Or position 2?

Let me choose a word that places E at position 1? And then uses new letters? Such as S and L? For example:

Word: ""ES_R_"" -> but with R at position 3: so ""E S R _ _""

What words? ""ESSAY""? Letters: E,S,S,A,Y? But A is absent? Also, duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Avoid A? So not.

""ESPRY""? Not a common word? Valid? Check: espy means to catch sight of? Rare? But valid? But we need 5 letters: E S P R Y? But R is at position 3? So positions: E1, S2, P3? Wait, we need R at position 3? So ""ESPRY"" would be E1, S2, P3? But P3? We need R at position 3? So must be: E1, S2, R3? Then letters after? So pattern E S R _ _

What words? ""ESTRE""? Not common? Or ""ESERO""? No.

Common words: How about ""FERVOR""? But 6 letters? No, must be 5.

Another: ""MERGE""? But M at position 1? We want E at position 1? Merge: M1, E2, R3, G4, E5? That places R at position 3? So pattern: _ E R _ _? Because E is at position 2? In ""MERGE"", we have E at position 2? Which is consistent with our case 2? And E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So if we guess ""MERGE"", then position 5: E? But it will get '-' if the secret word does not have E there? But in our word? We are guessing it? The word ""MERGE"" is an option? But note absent letters: T,I,D,C,A,N? M is new? G new? So valid? But in the feedback for position 5, we will get x or -? Since we know E isn't at position 5, but E is present? Then we will get '-' for E at position 5? And also at position 4? We haven't tested position 4? But we don't care? Actually, we are using ""MERGE"" as a guess to get information? But let's see:

Better: We want to specifically test E in position 1? How about ""ESREY"" or similar? Not English.

Common word: ""ERROR""? But duplicate R? And E in position 1? Then positions: E1, R2, R3? But R2: we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess? So if we guess R in position 2, we will get '-'? But ""ERROR"" has R at position 2? That's bad? And also R at position 3? But we know R is at position 3? So R3 would be ✓? But R2 would get a '-'? And E1? Also E5? But E5 we know isn't possible? So avoid.

Another idea: ""SEVER""? S E V E R? Positions: S1, E2, V3, E4, R5? But V at position 3? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at 3.

So we must stick to pattern: _ _ R _ _

For E in position 1: words starting with ""E"" and then any letter? Then R at position 3? Then two more? And avoid C,A,N,T,I,D.

So E + some letter + R + two letters? Common words?

Examples:

""EERIE"": E1, E2, R3, I4, E5? But I is absent? And E at position 5? Avoid.

""EMBER"": As before? Won't work for position 3.

""EPHOR""? Not common.

What about? ""EGRET"": E1, G2, R3, E4, T5? But E at position 4? And T? T is absent? From ""tired"", we know T is absent? So avoid T? Also E at position 4? We know E cannot be in position 4? So guessing E4 is a waste? Also T absent? So ""EGRET"" is not good.

""ELVER"": E1, L2, V3, E4, R5? Position 3: V? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at position 3? So the third letter is R? So second letter is what? Then last two?

So for E1_ R _ _:

""E?R??"": 

Options:

- ""EARLY"": E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5? But A is absent? Avoid.

""EERIE"": duplicate E and I absent? Avoid.

""EKING""? E1,K? K2,R? No: ""EKING"" is E,K,I,N,G? Not E?R pattern? Because R not at position 3? Unless? ""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? No R? Avoid.

How about ""EVERY"": E1,V2,E3,R4,Y5? But R4? We need R at 3? So no? Because R4? Not pattern.

So list: Words matching E?R?:

- earth: E,A,R,T,H? But A and T absent? Avoid.
- eager: E,A,G,E,R? A absent? And duplicate E? Avoid.

It appears there aren't many common words starting with E and R at position 3? Or I may be missing.

Try E with S? ""ESKER"": E1,S2,K3,E4,R5? But position 3 K? We need R? So not.

So perhaps E at position 2 is easier?

Pattern: ? E R ? ?

And R at position 3 fixed? So words: _ E R _ _

Now, first position? Must be a consonant? Common.

Examples:

- BERET: B1,E2,R3,E4,T5? But E at position 4? Not allowed? And T absent? Avoid.

- FERAL: F1,E2,R3,A4,L5? A absent? Avoid.

- GERMY? Not common? G1,E2,R3,M4,Y5? Letters G,M,Y? Valid? G is not absent? M new? Y? But ""germy"" is an adjective? Valid? Assume valid? But E in guess at position 2? And R3.

Also position 4: M? Position 5: Y?

But the secret word: E is present and should be at position 2? Or if not, then position 1? So if we get feedback on E in position 2: if ✓, then we know? If '-' then E must be at position 1? So good.

Similarly, we test other letters.

But M and Y? Common?

Another word: ""HERON"": H1,E2,R3,O4,N5? But n is absent? Avoid.

""LEERY"": L1,E2,E3? But R would be position 4? Not? ""LEERY"" is L1, E2, E3, R4, Y5? Not R at position 3? Pattern _E R _ _: so first letter? and E2, R3? so not leery.

""WEIRD"": W1,E2,I3,R4,D5? Not R3? R at position 4? No: W,E,I,R,D? Position 3 I? No.

A good common word: ""PERKY""? P1,E2,R3, K4,Y5? Letters P, E, R, K, Y? Avoid absent? None? C,A,N,T,I,D absent? P,K,Y? All new? Good.

Also, ""MERCY"": M1,E2,R3,C4,Y5? But C absent? Avoid C? So not.

""VERVE""? V1,E2,R3,V4,E5? Duplicate V? And E5 not allowed.

So ""PERKY"" seems good: P,E,R,K,Y? With E at position 2, R at position 3? Tests:
- P at position 1: if present? position?
- E at position 2: if correct? we get ✓? Or '-' meaning E is at position 1?
- R at position 3: we know is ✓? So we'll get ✓? No change?
- K at position 4: if present? position?
- Y at position 5: if present? position?

Also, the word is common: perky, meaning cheerful.

Therefore, a good guess.

Another possibility: ""BERYL""? But B1,E2,R3,Y4,L5? Letters B,Y,L? But from ""tired"", D absent? No: B new? Y new? L new? So ok.

But ""BERYL"" vs ""PERKY""? Both are fine? But I think ""PERKY"" uses K and P? K is common? Slightly more common? Or let's pick one.

Since we want to maximize information, ""PERKY"" includes P and K? Both common consonants.

But also, note that if the secret word is from a common set? We have limited information? So ""PERKY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""PERKY""

Based on the previous feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, D (eliminated via feedback from ""crane"" and ""tired"").
- **Present Letters**:
  - R is confirmed at position 3 (✓ from ""tired"").
  - E is present but incorrect in positions 4 (from ""tired"") and 5 (from ""crane"").

The secret word must:
- Have the form `_ _ R _ _` (since R is fixed at position 3).
- Contain E, but only in position 1 or 2 (since E cannot be in positions 3–5 due to feedback).
- Exclude the absent letters.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word matching the constraints.
- To prioritize narrowing E's position (testing E in position 2) and introducing new common letters like P, K, or Y for efficiency.
- To avoid reused absent letters and positions.

I selected ""PERKY"" because:
- It places R at position 3 (required), E at position 2 (to test its correctness there).
- It includes new common letters P, K, and Y (untested consonants).
- It avoids all absent letters and incorrect E positions.
- If E in ""PERKY"" is ✓ at position 2, E is confirmed there. If not (E gives -), E must be at position 1.

This guess maximizes positional information and tests high-frequency letters.

<guess>perky</guess>",perky,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

1. First guess ""crane"": 
   C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   Meaning:
   - C, A, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. Second guess ""tired"":
   T(x), I(x), R(✓), E(-), D(x)
   Meaning:
      - T, I, D are not in the word -> added to absent letters.
      - R is correct at position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3 and got ✓).
      - E is in the word (we knew this) but not in position 4 (since we guessed in position 4 and got -).

So, what we know:
- Absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, D
- Present letters: R and E, with R fixed at position 3.
- R is in position 3 (confirmed).
- E is present but not in positions 4 (from ""tired"") or 5 (from ""crane"").

Therefore, the secret word must have:
   _ _ R _ _

And E must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, or possibly 4? But wait:
From ""tired"": E in position 4 got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 4.
Similarly, from ""crane"": E in position 5 got '-', meaning E is not in position 5.

So positions for E: only 1 or 2 are possible? Because positions 3 is taken by R? So E cannot be in position 3? Because R is fixed at position 3.

Available positions for E: 1 or 2.

We must also account for the fact that E might appear only once? But we don't know. We only know at least one E is present.

But in any case, for position 1 or 2.

Therefore, the word has the form:
   Position 1: ? or E
   Position 2: ? or E (if E is in position 1, then position 2 cannot be E; but wait, duplicates are possible? But we haven't ruled out duplicates)
   Position 3: R (fixed)
   Position 4: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""tired"")
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""crane"")

But note: E must be in the word, so either position 1 or 2 must be E? Or could E be duplicated? If E is duplicated, then one E could be in position 1 or 2, and the other in another position? But we have excluded positions 4 and 5? Actually, we only know that the E we guessed in position 4 wasn't correct? And at position 5 wasn't correct? But if the word has two E's, then one could be elsewhere? However, we have no feedback indicating duplicates? So we must consider that E might be only one occurrence? But to be safe, we should not rule out duplicates.

However, since we got '-' for E only when guessed in position 4 and 5, meaning that E is not in position 4 and not in position 5? But position 3 is R? So actually, E must be in position 1 or 2? Because if E were in position 4 or 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for one of those? Actually no: if the word has two E's, then E might be in other positions? But let's see the feedback: 

In ""crane"" we guessed E at position 5, and got '-', meaning that E is present but not at position 5? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Similarly, in ""tired"", E at position 4 got '-', meaning E is present but not at position 4? But if the word has an E in position 4, then we would have gotten ✓? So we know the word does not have E in position 4? Similarly not in position 5? And position 3 is R? So E must be in position 1 or 2? Unless the word has duplicates and E is in position 1, 2 and maybe another? But positions 4 and 5 are excluded? So only positions 1, 2 are available? And position 3 is taken by R? So the remaining positions for E are 1 and 2? Therefore, we are safe to assume that E is at position 1 or 2? Actually, yes.

Therefore, the word must be of the form:
   Position 1: E or not? But E must be in 1 or 2? So two cases:
   Case 1: E at position 1 -> E _ R _ _
   Case 2: E at position 2 -> _ E R _ _

But also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,T,I,D

So available letters? We know only R and E so far? And we have 5 positions? So we need three more letters? They must be from the remaining alphabet minus absent ones.

Absent: C,A,N,T,I,D -> so we avoid: C, A, N, T, I, D.

The word must contain E and R? And three other letters not from {C,A,N,T,I,D}.

Also, remember that R is fixed at position 3? And E is at position 1 or 2.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test which position E is in? And reveal other letters? We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases.

Also, we want to test new common letters: like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc? Because we haven't used S, L, O, etc.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 1 or 2? We can try to include both possibilities? Or we can choose a word that fits one case? But we don't know which case? So maybe try a word that has E in position 1? That will tell us: if E is at position 1? Or if we get '-' then E must be at position 2? Because if we guess E at position 1 and it's correct, we get ✓? If we get '-' that means E is in the word but not there? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only options? Similarly, if we guess E at position 2? We can get either ✓ or '-'? But if we get ✓? Then position 2 is E? If '-' then position 1 must be E? Because it's the only alternative.

So we can design a guess to pin down E's position.

Also, we want to introduce new letters? So let's try common letters: B, S, L, O, P, etc.

Let me think of words that:
- Have R at position 3 (fixed)
- Have E either at position 1 or 2? But we haven't decided? So we can try:

Option: place E at position 1 and see what happens? Then the word form: E _ R _ _

For example, ""E _ R S _ ""? or whatever.

We can also consider: which letters are common? We need to test more consonants.

Let's list available common vowels and consonants:
Vowels: E (we have), and we might have O, U? But we haven't tried? Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? But need common.

Good common letters: S, L, O, U, M, P, K, etc.

Now, we can form words:

If we want to test E at position 1? For example: ""ES__R""? Wait, R is at position 3? So pattern: E _ R _ _

Example: ""EBONY"" but B and N? N is absent? Also Y? But we know N absent? Avoid.

Another: ""EMBER"": E, M, B, E, R? Wait this has E at position 1 and position 4? But position 4? We know E cannot be at position 4 (from ""tired"" feedback)? So even if we guessed, it would be wrong? Also, duplicate E? And B is new? But let's see: ""EMBER"" would be E at 1, R at 5? But we need R at position 3? So not possible? Because it would place R at position 5? But our structure is _ _ R _ _? So position 3 must be R? Therefore, any guess must have R in position 3? So ""EMBER"" doesn't fit because it's E,M,B,E,R -> positions: E1, M2, B3, E4, R5? So at position 3? B? But we need R? So no? We must have R at position 3.

Therefore, our guess must have R at position 3? So pattern: _ _ R _ _

And for E: we want to test position 1? Or position 2?

Let me choose a word that places E at position 1? And then uses new letters? Such as S and L? For example:

Word: ""ES_R_"" -> but with R at position 3: so ""E S R _ _""

What words? ""ESSAY""? Letters: E,S,S,A,Y? But A is absent? Also, duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Avoid A? So not.

""ESPRY""? Not a common word? Valid? Check: espy means to catch sight of? Rare? But valid? But we need 5 letters: E S P R Y? But R is at position 3? So positions: E1, S2, P3? Wait, we need R at position 3? So ""ESPRY"" would be E1, S2, P3? But P3? We need R at position 3? So must be: E1, S2, R3? Then letters after? So pattern E S R _ _

What words? ""ESTRE""? Not common? Or ""ESERO""? No.

Common words: How about ""FERVOR""? But 6 letters? No, must be 5.

Another: ""MERGE""? But M at position 1? We want E at position 1? Merge: M1, E2, R3, G4, E5? That places R at position 3? So pattern: _ E R _ _? Because E is at position 2? In ""MERGE"", we have E at position 2? Which is consistent with our case 2? And E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So if we guess ""MERGE"", then position 5: E? But it will get '-' if the secret word does not have E there? But in our word? We are guessing it? The word ""MERGE"" is an option? But note absent letters: T,I,D,C,A,N? M is new? G new? So valid? But in the feedback for position 5, we will get x or -? Since we know E isn't at position 5, but E is present? Then we will get '-' for E at position 5? And also at position 4? We haven't tested position 4? But we don't care? Actually, we are using ""MERGE"" as a guess to get information? But let's see:

Better: We want to specifically test E in position 1? How about ""ESREY"" or similar? Not English.

Common word: ""ERROR""? But duplicate R? And E in position 1? Then positions: E1, R2, R3? But R2: we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess? So if we guess R in position 2, we will get '-'? But ""ERROR"" has R at position 2? That's bad? And also R at position 3? But we know R is at position 3? So R3 would be ✓? But R2 would get a '-'? And E1? Also E5? But E5 we know isn't possible? So avoid.

Another idea: ""SEVER""? S E V E R? Positions: S1, E2, V3, E4, R5? But V at position 3? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at 3.

So we must stick to pattern: _ _ R _ _

For E in position 1: words starting with ""E"" and then any letter? Then R at position 3? Then two more? And avoid C,A,N,T,I,D.

So E + some letter + R + two letters? Common words?

Examples:

""EERIE"": E1, E2, R3, I4, E5? But I is absent? And E at position 5? Avoid.

""EMBER"": As before? Won't work for position 3.

""EPHOR""? Not common.

What about? ""EGRET"": E1, G2, R3, E4, T5? But E at position 4? And T? T is absent? From ""tired"", we know T is absent? So avoid T? Also E at position 4? We know E cannot be in position 4? So guessing E4 is a waste? Also T absent? So ""EGRET"" is not good.

""ELVER"": E1, L2, V3, E4, R5? Position 3: V? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at position 3? So the third letter is R? So second letter is what? Then last two?

So for E1_ R _ _:

""E?R??"": 

Options:

- ""EARLY"": E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5? But A is absent? Avoid.

""EERIE"": duplicate E and I absent? Avoid.

""EKING""? E1,K? K2,R? No: ""EKING"" is E,K,I,N,G? Not E?R pattern? Because R not at position 3? Unless? ""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? No R? Avoid.

How about ""EVERY"": E1,V2,E3,R4,Y5? But R4? We need R at 3? So no? Because R4? Not pattern.

So list: Words matching E?R?:

- earth: E,A,R,T,H? But A and T absent? Avoid.
- eager: E,A,G,E,R? A absent? And duplicate E? Avoid.

It appears there aren't many common words starting with E and R at position 3? Or I may be missing.

Try E with S? ""ESKER"": E1,S2,K3,E4,R5? But position 3 K? We need R? So not.

So perhaps E at position 2 is easier?

Pattern: ? E R ? ?

And R at position 3 fixed? So words: _ E R _ _

Now, first position? Must be a consonant? Common.

Examples:

- BERET: B1,E2,R3,E4,T5? But E at position 4? Not allowed? And T absent? Avoid.

- FERAL: F1,E2,R3,A4,L5? A absent? Avoid.

- GERMY? Not common? G1,E2,R3,M4,Y5? Letters G,M,Y? Valid? G is not absent? M new? Y? But ""germy"" is an adjective? Valid? Assume valid? But E in guess at position 2? And R3.

Also position 4: M? Position 5: Y?

But the secret word: E is present and should be at position 2? Or if not, then position 1? So if we get feedback on E in position 2: if ✓, then we know? If '-' then E must be at position 1? So good.

Similarly, we test other letters.

But M and Y? Common?

Another word: ""HERON"": H1,E2,R3,O4,N5? But n is absent? Avoid.

""LEERY"": L1,E2,E3? But R would be position 4? Not? ""LEERY"" is L1, E2, E3, R4, Y5? Not R at position 3? Pattern _E R _ _: so first letter? and E2, R3? so not leery.

""WEIRD"": W1,E2,I3,R4,D5? Not R3? R at position 4? No: W,E,I,R,D? Position 3 I? No.

A good common word: ""PERKY""? P1,E2,R3, K4,Y5? Letters P, E, R, K, Y? Avoid absent? None? C,A,N,T,I,D absent? P,K,Y? All new? Good.

Also, ""MERCY"": M1,E2,R3,C4,Y5? But C absent? Avoid C? So not.

""VERVE""? V1,E2,R3,V4,E5? Duplicate V? And E5 not allowed.

So ""PERKY"" seems good: P,E,R,K,Y? With E at position 2, R at position 3? Tests:
- P at position 1: if present? position?
- E at position 2: if correct? we get ✓? Or '-' meaning E is at position 1?
- R at position 3: we know is ✓? So we'll get ✓? No change?
- K at position 4: if present? position?
- Y at position 5: if present? position?

Also, the word is common: perky, meaning cheerful.

Therefore, a good guess.

Another possibility: ""BERYL""? But B1,E2,R3,Y4,L5? Letters B,Y,L? But from ""tired"", D absent? No: B new? Y new? L new? So ok.

But ""BERYL"" vs ""PERKY""? Both are fine? But I think ""PERKY"" uses K and P? K is common? Slightly more common? Or let's pick one.

Since we want to maximize information, ""PERKY"" includes P and K? Both common consonants.

But also, note that if the secret word is from a common set? We have limited information? So ""PERKY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""PERKY""Based on the previous feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, D (eliminated via feedback from ""crane"" and ""tired"").
- **Present Letters**:
  - R is confirmed at position 3 (✓ from ""tired"").
  - E is present but incorrect in positions 4 (from ""tired"") and 5 (from ""crane"").

The secret word must:
- Have the form `_ _ R _ _` (since R is fixed at position 3).
- Contain E, but only in position 1 or 2 (since E cannot be in positions 3–5 due to feedback).
- Exclude the absent letters.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word matching the constraints.
- To prioritize narrowing E's position (testing E in position 2) and introducing new common letters like P, K, or Y for efficiency.
- To avoid reused absent letters and positions.

I selected ""PERKY"" because:
- It places R at position 3 (required), E at position 2 (to test its correctness there).
- It includes new common letters P, K, and Y (untested consonants).
- It avoids all absent letters and incorrect E positions.
- If E in ""PERKY"" is ✓ at position 2, E is confirmed there. If not (E gives -), E must be at position 1.

This guess maximizes positional information and tests high-frequency letters.",Guess 3: perky -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,jerky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C: x -> not in the secret word
R: - -> R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it as the second letter)
A: x -> not in the secret word
N: x -> not in the secret word
E: - -> E is in the word, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it as the fifth letter)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions we guessed.
- The secret word does NOT contain C, A, or N.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Our next guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include R and E (because they are present).
- Exclude C, A, N (because they are absent).
- We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Also, note that the positions for R and E are not fixed:
- R cannot be in position 2 (the second letter).
- E cannot be in position 5 (the last letter).

We must avoid placing R in the second position and E in the fifth position in our guess, because we know they don't belong there.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common consonants we haven't tried: T, S, L, D, etc.

A good approach is to try a word that has R and E, and also other common letters that we haven't tested yet, such as T, S, L.

Example words:
- ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but note we are avoiding A and N, and this doesn't include C,A,N.
  Let's check: T, R, I, E, S. None of these are C,A,N.

But we must also avoid placing R in position 2? Actually, in ""TRIES"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong for the secret word. However, in our guess, we can still put R in position 2 to test? Actually, we can, but we already know that the secret word doesn't have R in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we will get a '-' again? Actually, wait: the feedback tells us about the secret word. Since we know R isn't in position 2, we can avoid that.

Better to put R in a different position. We want to test R in other positions.

Similarly, we know E isn't at the end, so avoid putting E at the end.

Possible words:

Option: ""ROGUE"": R at position 1, which we haven't tested? But note: in ""crane"", we had R at position 2. Now we can try R at position 1? Also E at position 5? But wait: we know E shouldn't be at position 5? So avoid E at position 5.

So ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.

Another: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D
- Positions: R at 3, E at 4. This avoids R at position 2 and E at position 5.
- Letters: T, I, R, E, D -> no C, A, N.

This seems good because we test T, I, D as new letters.

Another option: ""STREW"" -> S, T, R, E, W -> but note E is at position 4? Actually: positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), E (4), W (5). But E is at position 4? That's okay because we don't know about position 4. And W is new.

But in the secret word, we know E is present but not at position 5. Position 4 might be possible.

Also, note that in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning it's elsewhere. So trying R at position 3 is a new position.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and got '-', so trying E at position 4 is a new position.

So let's consider ""TIRED"":

Why ""TIRED""? It tests R at position 3 and E at position 4, which are positions we haven't tried for these letters.

Alternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is less common and we haven't tested Q. Also, U. Maybe not optimal because we want to test common letters.

Another idea: ""RESET""? But that has duplicate E? Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. It's possible, but let's avoid for simplicity.

Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word. But in our case, we don't have feedback about duplicates.

Another word: ""TERSE"" -> has E twice? Also, E at the end? Avoid the end for E.

Actually, ""TERSE"" ends with E, which we know is wrong? So avoid.

So back to ""TIRED"". Let me confirm it's a valid word: tired (exhausted). Yes.

We can test:

- T in position 1: if in secret, is it correct?
- I in position 2: new letter
- R in position 3: we know R is in the word, so we see if it's at position 3?
- E in position 4: we know E is in the word, see if it's at position 4?
- D in position 5: new letter.

This should give us new information.

Alternatively, another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Positions: S1, T2, O3, R4? No: STORE has R at position 4 and E at position 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? So avoid.

How about ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5? But N is absent! We know N is not in the word. Our feedback said N(x). So we cannot use N. So avoid ""STERN"".

Another: ""DRIVE""? D1, R2, I3, V4, E5 -> E at position 5: avoid.

""RIDER""? Duplicate R? And we might not know about duplicates? Also, E is missing? We must include E because we know E is present. So ""RIDER"" doesn't have E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, no: we are allowed to guess words that don't have E? But we know E is present? Actually, the rules don't force us to include every known letter, but it's inefficient to leave out a known letter. Because if we don't test E again, we don't get information about its position. So we should include E.

Therefore, let's go with ""TIRED"".

So next guess: TIRED

But note: we are avoiding placing R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in any position except maybe we get more information? In ""TIRED"", R is in position 3, which is new.

Similarly, E is in position 4, avoiding position 5.

So I think that's good.

Another possibility: ""GRIME"" -> G1, R2? R in position 2: we know R is not at position 2? So if we put R in position 2, we will get '-' for R? But actually, we already know it's not there, so we can avoid wasting that. Also, ""GRIME"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""TIRED"" seems acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, N. ""TIRED"" has T, I, R, E, D -> none of those are C,A,N. So that's safe.

So the next guess is ""TIRED"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are absent in the secret word.
- R is present but not in position 2.
- E is present but not in position 5.

For the next guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing R and E (since they are in the secret word).
- Avoid C, A, N (absent letters).
- Avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
- Use new common letters like T, I, D to gather information about other positions in the word.

I selected ""TIRED"" because:
- It includes R and E, with R in position 3 and E in position 4 (both untested positions).
- It uses new letters: T, I, D, which are common and could provide useful feedback.
- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, A, N) and avoids placing E in position 5.

- R is in position 3 (confirmed).
- E is present but not in positions 4 (from ""tired"") or 5 (from ""crane"").

Therefore, the secret word must have:
   _ _ R _ _

And E must be in one of the positions: 1, 2, or possibly 4? But wait:
From ""tired"": E in position 4 got '-', meaning E is in the word but not in position 4.
Similarly, from ""crane"": E in position 5 got '-', meaning E is not in position 5.

So positions for E: only 1 or 2 are possible? Because positions 3 is taken by R? So E cannot be in position 3? Because R is fixed at position 3.

Available positions for E: 1 or 2.

We must also account for the fact that E might appear only once? But we don't know. We only know at least one E is present.

But in any case, for position 1 or 2.

Therefore, the word has the form:
   Position 1: ? or E
   Position 2: ? or E (if E is in position 1, then position 2 cannot be E; but wait, duplicates are possible? But we haven't ruled out duplicates)
   Position 3: R (fixed)
   Position 4: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""tired"")
   Position 5: ? (cannot be E because of feedback from ""crane"")

But note: E must be in the word, so either position 1 or 2 must be E? Or could E be duplicated? If E is duplicated, then one E could be in position 1 or 2, and the other in another position? But we have excluded positions 4 and 5? Actually, we only know that the E we guessed in position 4 wasn't correct? And at position 5 wasn't correct? But if the word has two E's, then one could be elsewhere? However, we have no feedback indicating duplicates? So we must consider that E might be only one occurrence? But to be safe, we should not rule out duplicates.

However, since we got '-' for E only when guessed in position 4 and 5, meaning that E is not in position 4 and not in position 5? But position 3 is R? So actually, E must be in position 1 or 2? Because if E were in position 4 or 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for one of those? Actually no: if the word has two E's, then E might be in other positions? But let's see the feedback: 

In ""crane"" we guessed E at position 5, and got '-', meaning that E is present but not at position 5? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Similarly, in ""tired"", E at position 4 got '-', meaning E is present but not at position 4? But if the word has an E in position 4, then we would have gotten ✓? So we know the word does not have E in position 4? Similarly not in position 5? And position 3 is R? So E must be in position 1 or 2? Unless the word has duplicates and E is in position 1, 2 and maybe another? But positions 4 and 5 are excluded? So only positions 1, 2 are available? And position 3 is taken by R? So the remaining positions for E are 1 and 2? Therefore, we are safe to assume that E is at position 1 or 2? Actually, yes.

Therefore, the word must be of the form:
   Position 1: E or not? But E must be in 1 or 2? So two cases:
   Case 1: E at position 1 -> E _ R _ _
   Case 2: E at position 2 -> _ E R _ _

But also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,T,I,D

So available letters? We know only R and E so far? And we have 5 positions? So we need three more letters? They must be from the remaining alphabet minus absent ones.

Absent: C,A,N,T,I,D -> so we avoid: C, A, N, T, I, D.

The word must contain E and R? And three other letters not from {C,A,N,T,I,D}.

Also, remember that R is fixed at position 3? And E is at position 1 or 2.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test which position E is in? And reveal other letters? We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases.

Also, we want to test new common letters: like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc? Because we haven't used S, L, O, etc.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 1 or 2? We can try to include both possibilities? Or we can choose a word that fits one case? But we don't know which case? So maybe try a word that has E in position 1? That will tell us: if E is at position 1? Or if we get '-' then E must be at position 2? Because if we guess E at position 1 and it's correct, we get ✓? If we get '-' that means E is in the word but not there? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only options? Similarly, if we guess E at position 2? We can get either ✓ or '-'? But if we get ✓? Then position 2 is E? If '-' then position 1 must be E? Because it's the only alternative.

So we can design a guess to pin down E's position.

Also, we want to introduce new letters? So let's try common letters: B, S, L, O, P, etc.

Let me think of words that:
- Have R at position 3 (fixed)
- Have E either at position 1 or 2? But we haven't decided? So we can try:

Option: place E at position 1 and see what happens? Then the word form: E _ R _ _

For example, ""E _ R S _ ""? or whatever.

We can also consider: which letters are common? We need to test more consonants.

Let's list available common vowels and consonants:
Vowels: E (we have), and we might have O, U? But we haven't tried? Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? But need common.

Good common letters: S, L, O, U, M, P, K, etc.

Now, we can form words:

If we want to test E at position 1? For example: ""ES__R""? Wait, R is at position 3? So pattern: E _ R _ _

Example: ""EBONY"" but B and N? N is absent? Also Y? But we know N absent? Avoid.

Another: ""EMBER"": E, M, B, E, R? Wait this has E at position 1 and position 4? But position 4? We know E cannot be at position 4 (from ""tired"" feedback)? So even if we guessed, it would be wrong? Also, duplicate E? And B is new? But let's see: ""EMBER"" would be E at 1, R at 5? But we need R at position 3? So not possible? Because it would place R at position 5? But our structure is _ _ R _ _? So position 3 must be R? Therefore, any guess must have R in position 3? So ""EMBER"" doesn't fit because it's E,M,B,E,R -> positions: E1, M2, B3, E4, R5? So at position 3? B? But we need R? So no? We must have R at position 3.

Therefore, our guess must have R at position 3? So pattern: _ _ R _ _

And for E: we want to test position 1? Or position 2?

Let me choose a word that places E at position 1? And then uses new letters? Such as S and L? For example:

Word: ""ES_R_"" -> but with R at position 3: so ""E S R _ _""

What words? ""ESSAY""? Letters: E,S,S,A,Y? But A is absent? Also, duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Avoid A? So not.

""ESPRY""? Not a common word? Valid? Check: espy means to catch sight of? Rare? But valid? But we need 5 letters: E S P R Y? But R is at position 3? So positions: E1, S2, P3? Wait, we need R at position 3? So ""ESPRY"" would be E1, S2, P3? But P3? We need R at position 3? So must be: E1, S2, R3? Then letters after? So pattern E S R _ _

What words? ""ESTRE""? Not common? Or ""ESERO""? No.

Common words: How about ""FERVOR""? But 6 letters? No, must be 5.

Another: ""MERGE""? But M at position 1? We want E at position 1? Merge: M1, E2, R3, G4, E5? That places R at position 3? So pattern: _ E R _ _? Because E is at position 2? In ""MERGE"", we have E at position 2? Which is consistent with our case 2? And E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So if we guess ""MERGE"", then position 5: E? But it will get '-' if the secret word does not have E there? But in our word? We are guessing it? The word ""MERGE"" is an option? But note absent letters: T,I,D,C,A,N? M is new? G new? So valid? But in the feedback for position 5, we will get x or -? Since we know E isn't at position 5, but E is present? Then we will get '-' for E at position 5? And also at position 4? We haven't tested position 4? But we don't care? Actually, we are using ""MERGE"" as a guess to get information? But let's see:

Better: We want to specifically test E in position 1? How about ""ESREY"" or similar? Not English.

Common word: ""ERROR""? But duplicate R? And E in position 1? Then positions: E1, R2, R3? But R2: we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess? So if we guess R in position 2, we will get '-'? But ""ERROR"" has R at position 2? That's bad? And also R at position 3? But we know R is at position 3? So R3 would be ✓? But R2 would get a '-'? And E1? Also E5? But E5 we know isn't possible? So avoid.

Another idea: ""SEVER""? S E V E R? Positions: S1, E2, V3, E4, R5? But V at position 3? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at 3.

So we must stick to pattern: _ _ R _ _

For E in position 1: words starting with ""E"" and then any letter? Then R at position 3? Then two more? And avoid C,A,N,T,I,D.

So E + some letter + R + two letters? Common words?

Examples:

""EERIE"": E1, E2, R3, I4, E5? But I is absent? And E at position 5? Avoid.

""EMBER"": As before? Won't work for position 3.

""EPHOR""? Not common.

What about? ""EGRET"": E1, G2, R3, E4, T5? But E at position 4? And T? T is absent? From ""tired"", we know T is absent? So avoid T? Also E at position 4? We know E cannot be in position 4? So guessing E4 is a waste? Also T absent? So ""EGRET"" is not good.

""ELVER"": E1, L2, V3, E4, R5? Position 3: V? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at position 3? So the third letter is R? So second letter is what? Then last two?

So for E1_ R _ _:

""E?R??"": 

Options:

- ""EARLY"": E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5? But A is absent? Avoid.

""EERIE"": duplicate E and I absent? Avoid.

""EKING""? E1,K? K2,R? No: ""EKING"" is E,K,I,N,G? Not E?R pattern? Because R not at position 3? Unless? ""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? No R? Avoid.

How about ""EVERY"": E1,V2,E3,R4,Y5? But R4? We need R at 3? So no? Because R4? Not pattern.

So list: Words matching E?R?:

- earth: E,A,R,T,H? But A and T absent? Avoid.
- eager: E,A,G,E,R? A absent? And duplicate E? Avoid.

It appears there aren't many common words starting with E and R at position 3? Or I may be missing.

Try E with S? ""ESKER"": E1,S2,K3,E4,R5? But position 3 K? We need R? So not.

So perhaps E at position 2 is easier?

Pattern: ? E R ? ?

And R at position 3 fixed? So words: _ E R _ _

Now, first position? Must be a consonant? Common.

Examples:

- BERET: B1,E2,R3,E4,T5? But E at position 4? Not allowed? And T absent? Avoid.

- FERAL: F1,E2,R3,A4,L5? A absent? Avoid.

- GERMY? Not common? G1,E2,R3,M4,Y5? Letters G,M,Y? Valid? G is not absent? M new? Y? But ""germy"" is an adjective? Valid? Assume valid? But E in guess at position 2? And R3.

Also position 4: M? Position 5: Y?

But the secret word: E is present and should be at position 2? Or if not, then position 1? So if we get feedback on E in position 2: if ✓, then we know? If '-' then E must be at position 1? So good.

Similarly, we test other letters.

But M and Y? Common?

Another word: ""HERON"": H1,E2,R3,O4,N5? But n is absent? Avoid.

""LEERY"": L1,E2,E3? But R would be position 4? Not? ""LEERY"" is L1, E2, E3, R4, Y5? Not R at position 3? Pattern _E R _ _: so first letter? and E2, R3? so not leery.

""WEIRD"": W1,E2,I3,R4,D5? Not R3? R at position 4? No: W,E,I,R,D? Position 3 I? No.

A good common word: ""PERKY""? P1,E2,R3, K4,Y5? Letters P, E, R, K, Y? Avoid absent? None? C,A,N,T,I,D absent? P,K,Y? All new? Good.

Also, ""MERCY"": M1,E2,R3,C4,Y5? But C absent? Avoid C? So not.

""VERVE""? V1,E2,R3,V4,E5? Duplicate V? And E5 not allowed.

So ""PERKY"" seems good: P,E,R,K,Y? With E at position 2, R at position 3? Tests:
- P at position 1: if present? position?
- E at position 2: if correct? we get ✓? Or '-' meaning E is at position 1?
- R at position 3: we know is ✓? So we'll get ✓? No change?
- K at position 4: if present? position?
- Y at position 5: if present? position?

Also, the word is common: perky, meaning cheerful.

Therefore, a good guess.

Another possibility: ""BERYL""? But B1,E2,R3,Y4,L5? Letters B,Y,L? But from ""tired"", D absent? No: B new? Y new? L new? So ok.

But ""BERYL"" vs ""PERKY""? Both are fine? But I think ""PERKY"" uses K and P? K is common? Slightly more common? Or let's pick one.

Since we want to maximize information, ""PERKY"" includes P and K? Both common consonants.

But also, note that if the secret word is from a common set? We have limited information? So ""PERKY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, next guess: ""PERKY""Based on the previous feedback:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, D (eliminated via feedback from ""crane"" and ""tired"").
- **Present Letters**:
  - R is confirmed at position 3 (✓ from ""tired"").
  - E is present but incorrect in positions 4 (from ""tired"") and 5 (from ""crane"").

The secret word must:
- Have the form `_ _ R _ _` (since R is fixed at position 3).
- Contain E, but only in position 1 or 2 (since E cannot be in positions 3–5 due to feedback).
- Exclude the absent letters.

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word matching the constraints.
- To prioritize narrowing E's position (testing E in position 2) and introducing new common letters like P, K, or Y for efficiency.
- To avoid reused absent letters and positions.

I selected ""PERKY"" because:
- It places R at position 3 (required), E at position 2 (to test its correctness there).
- It includes new common letters P, K, and Y (untested consonants).
- It avoids all absent letters and incorrect E positions.
- If E in ""PERKY"" is ✓ at position 2, E is confirmed there. If not (E gives -), E must be at position 1.

This guess maximizes positional information and tests high-frequency letters.

None of these are C,A,N.\n\nBut we must also avoid placing R in position 2? Actually, in ""TRIES"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong for the secret word. However, in our guess, we can still put R in position 2 to test? Actually, we can, but we already know that the secret word doesn\'t have R in position 2, so if we put R in position 2, we will get a \'-\' again? Actually, wait: the feedback tells us about the secret word. Since we know R isn\'t in position 2, we can avoid that.\n\nBetter to put R in a different position. We want to test R in other positions.\n\nSimilarly, we know E isn\'t at the end, so avoid putting E at the end.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: ""ROGUE"": R at position 1, which we haven\'t tested? But note: in ""crane"", we had R at position 2. Now we can try R at position 1? Also E at position 5? But wait: we know E shouldn\'t be at position 5? So avoid E at position 5.\n\nSo ""ROGUE"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\nAnother: ""TIRED"" -> T, I, R, E, D\n- Positions: R at 3, E at 4. This avoids R at position 2 and E at position 5.\n- Letters: T, I, R, E, D -> no C, A, N.\n\nThis seems good because we test T, I, D as new letters.\n\nAnother option: ""STREW"" -> S, T, R, E, W -> but note E is at position 4? Actually: positions: S (1), T (2), R (3), E (4), W (5). But E is at position 4? That\'s okay because we don\'t know about position 4. And W is new.\n\nBut in the secret word, we know E is present but not at position 5. Position 4 might be possible.\n\nAlso, note that in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning it\'s elsewhere. So trying R at position 3 is a new position.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 and got \'-\', so trying E at position 4 is a new position.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""TIRED"":\n\nWhy ""TIRED""? It tests R at position 3 and E at position 4, which are positions we haven\'t tried for these letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""QUERY"" but Q is less common and we haven\'t tested Q. Also, U. Maybe not optimal because we want to test common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""RESET""? But that has duplicate E? Actually, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. It\'s possible, but let\'s avoid for simplicity.\n\nActually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates unless they are in the word. But in our case, we don\'t have feedback about duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""TERSE"" -> has E twice? Also, E at the end? Avoid the end for E.\n\nActually, ""TERSE"" ends with E, which we know is wrong? So avoid.\n\nSo back to ""TIRED"". Let me confirm it\'s a valid word: tired (exhausted). Yes.\n\nWe can test:\n\n- T in position 1: if in secret, is it correct?\n- I in position 2: new letter\n- R in position 3: we know R is in the word, so we see if it\'s at position 3?\n- E in position 4: we know E is in the word, see if it\'s at position 4?\n- D in position 5: new letter.\n\nThis should give us new information.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Positions: S1, T2, O3, R4? No: STORE has R at position 4 and E at position 5. But E at position 5 is forbidden? So avoid.\n\nHow about ""STERN"": S1, T2, E3, R4, N5? But N is absent! We know N is not in the word. Our feedback said N(x). So we cannot use N. So avoid ""STERN"".\n\nAnother: ""DRIVE""? D1, R2, I3, V4, E5 -> E at position 5: avoid.\n\n""RIDER""? Duplicate R? And we might not know about duplicates? Also, E is missing? We must include E because we know E is present. So ""RIDER"" doesn\'t have E -> invalid because we must include E? Actually, no: we are allowed to guess words that don\'t have E? But we know E is present? Actually, the rules don\'t force us to include every known letter, but it\'s inefficient to leave out a known letter. Because if we don\'t test E again, we don\'t get information about its position. So we should include E.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""TIRED"".\n\nSo next guess: TIRED\n\nBut note: we are avoiding placing R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in any position except maybe we get more information? In ""TIRED"", R is in position 3, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, E is in position 4, avoiding position 5.\n\nSo I think that\'s good.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GRIME"" -> G1, R2? R in position 2: we know R is not at position 2? So if we put R in position 2, we will get \'-\' for R? But actually, we already know it\'s not there, so we can avoid wasting that. Also, ""GRIME"" has E at position 5 -> avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""TIRED"" seems acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, N. ""TIRED"" has T, I, R, E, D -> none of those are C,A,N. So that\'s safe.\n\nSo the next guess is ""TIRED"".Based on the previous feedback for ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are absent in the secret word.\n- R is present but not in position 2.\n- E is present but not in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess, I need:\n- A 5-letter word containing R and E (since they are in the secret word).\n- Avoid C, A, N (absent letters).\n- Avoid placing R in position 2 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).\n- Use new common letters like T, I, D to gather information about other positions in the word.\n\nI selected ""TIRED"" because:\n- It includes R and E, with R in position 3 and E in position 4 (both untested positions).\n- It uses new letters: T, I, D, which are common and could provide useful feedback.\n- It avoids all forbidden letters (C, A, N) and avoids placing E in position 5.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

If E is duplicated, then one E could be in position 1 or 2, and the other in another position? But we have excluded positions 4 and 5? Actually, we only know that the E we guessed in position 4 wasn\'t correct? And at position 5 wasn\'t correct? But if the word has two E\'s, then one could be elsewhere? However, we have no feedback indicating duplicates? So we must consider that E might be only one occurrence? But to be safe, we should not rule out duplicates.\n\nHowever, since we got \'-\' for E only when guessed in position 4 and 5, meaning that E is not in position 4 and not in position 5? But position 3 is R? So actually, E must be in position 1 or 2? Because if E were in position 4 or 5, we would have gotten a ✓ for one of those? Actually no: if the word has two E\'s, then E might be in other positions? But let\'s see the feedback: \n\nIn ""crane"" we guessed E at position 5, and got \'-\', meaning that E is present but not at position 5? So E is in the word but not in position 5? Similarly, in ""tired"", E at position 4 got \'-\', meaning E is present but not at position 4? But if the word has an E in position 4, then we would have gotten ✓? So we know the word does not have E in position 4? Similarly not in position 5? And position 3 is R? So E must be in position 1 or 2? Unless the word has duplicates and E is in position 1, 2 and maybe another? But positions 4 and 5 are excluded? So only positions 1, 2 are available? And position 3 is taken by R? So the remaining positions for E are 1 and 2? Therefore, we are safe to assume that E is at position 1 or 2? Actually, yes.\n\nTherefore, the word must be of the form:\n   Position 1: E or not? But E must be in 1 or 2? So two cases:\n   Case 1: E at position 1 -> E _ R _ _\n   Case 2: E at position 2 -> _ E R _ _\n\nBut also, we have absent letters: C,A,N,T,I,D\n\nSo available letters? We know only R and E so far? And we have 5 positions? So we need three more letters? They must be from the remaining alphabet minus absent ones.\n\nAbsent: C,A,N,T,I,D -> so we avoid: C, A, N, T, I, D.\n\nThe word must contain E and R? And three other letters not from {C,A,N,T,I,D}.\n\nAlso, remember that R is fixed at position 3? And E is at position 1 or 2.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test which position E is in? And reveal other letters? We can design a guess that helps us distinguish between the two cases.\n\nAlso, we want to test new common letters: like S, L, O, U, M, P, etc? Because we haven\'t used S, L, O, etc.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word with E in position 1 or 2? We can try to include both possibilities? Or we can choose a word that fits one case? But we don\'t know which case? So maybe try a word that has E in position 1? That will tell us: if E is at position 1? Or if we get \'-\' then E must be at position 2? Because if we guess E at position 1 and it\'s correct, we get ✓? If we get \'-\' that means E is in the word but not there? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only options? Similarly, if we guess E at position 2? We can get either ✓ or \'-\'? But if we get ✓? Then position 2 is E? If \'-\' then position 1 must be E? Because it\'s the only alternative.\n\nSo we can design a guess to pin down E\'s position.\n\nAlso, we want to introduce new letters? So let\'s try common letters: B, S, L, O, P, etc.\n\nLet me think of words that:\n- Have R at position 3 (fixed)\n- Have E either at position 1 or 2? But we haven\'t decided? So we can try:\n\nOption: place E at position 1 and see what happens? Then the word form: E _ R _ _\n\nFor example, ""E _ R S _ ""? or whatever.\n\nWe can also consider: which letters are common? We need to test more consonants.\n\nLet\'s list available common vowels and consonants:\nVowels: E (we have), and we might have O, U? But we haven\'t tried? Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z? But need common.\n\nGood common letters: S, L, O, U, M, P, K, etc.\n\nNow, we can form words:\n\nIf we want to test E at position 1? For example: ""ES__R""? Wait, R is at position 3? So pattern: E _ R _ _\n\nExample: ""EBONY"" but B and N? N is absent? Also Y? But we know N absent? Avoid.\n\nAnother: ""EMBER"": E, M, B, E, R? Wait this has E at position 1 and position 4? But position 4? We know E cannot be at position 4 (from ""tired"" feedback)? So even if we guessed, it would be wrong? Also, duplicate E? And B is new? But let\'s see: ""EMBER"" would be E at 1, R at 5? But we need R at position 3? So not possible? Because it would place R at position 5? But our structure is _ _ R _ _? So position 3 must be R? Therefore, any guess must have R in position 3? So ""EMBER"" doesn\'t fit because it\'s E,M,B,E,R -> positions: E1, M2, B3, E4, R5? So at position 3? B? But we need R? So no? We must have R at position 3.\n\nTherefore, our guess must have R at position 3? So pattern: _ _ R _ _\n\nAnd for E: we want to test position 1? Or position 2?\n\nLet me choose a word that places E at position 1? And then uses new letters? Such as S and L? For example:\n\nWord: ""ES_R_"" -> but with R at position 3: so ""E S R _ _""\n\nWhat words? ""ESSAY""? Letters: E,S,S,A,Y? But A is absent? Also, duplicate S? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Avoid A? So not.\n\n""ESPRY""? Not a common word? Valid? Check: espy means to catch sight of? Rare? But valid? But we need 5 letters: E S P R Y? But R is at position 3? So positions: E1, S2, P3? Wait, we need R at position 3? So ""ESPRY"" would be E1, S2, P3? But P3? We need R at position 3? So must be: E1, S2, R3? Then letters after? So pattern E S R _ _\n\nWhat words? ""ESTRE""? Not common? Or ""ESERO""? No.\n\nCommon words: How about ""FERVOR""? But 6 letters? No, must be 5.\n\nAnother: ""MERGE""? But M at position 1? We want E at position 1? Merge: M1, E2, R3, G4, E5? That places R at position 3? So pattern: _ E R _ _? Because E is at position 2? In ""MERGE"", we have E at position 2? Which is consistent with our case 2? And E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5? So if we guess ""MERGE"", then position 5: E? But it will get \'-\' if the secret word does not have E there? But in our word? We are guessing it? The word ""MERGE"" is an option? But note absent letters: T,I,D,C,A,N? M is new? G new? So valid? But in the feedback for position 5, we will get x or -? Since we know E isn\'t at position 5, but E is present? Then we will get \'-\' for E at position 5? And also at position 4? We haven\'t tested position 4? But we don\'t care? Actually, we are using ""MERGE"" as a guess to get information? But let\'s see:\n\nBetter: We want to specifically test E in position 1? How about ""ESREY"" or similar? Not English.\n\nCommon word: ""ERROR""? But duplicate R? And E in position 1? Then positions: E1, R2, R3? But R2: we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess? So if we guess R in position 2, we will get \'-\'? But ""ERROR"" has R at position 2? That\'s bad? And also R at position 3? But we know R is at position 3? So R3 would be ✓? But R2 would get a \'-\'? And E1? Also E5? But E5 we know isn\'t possible? So avoid.\n\nAnother idea: ""SEVER""? S E V E R? Positions: S1, E2, V3, E4, R5? But V at position 3? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at 3.\n\nSo we must stick to pattern: _ _ R _ _\n\nFor E in position 1: words starting with ""E"" and then any letter? Then R at position 3? Then two more? And avoid C,A,N,T,I,D.\n\nSo E + some letter + R + two letters? Common words?\n\nExamples:\n\n""EERIE"": E1, E2, R3, I4, E5? But I is absent? And E at position 5? Avoid.\n\n""EMBER"": As before? Won\'t work for position 3.\n\n""EPHOR""? Not common.\n\nWhat about? ""EGRET"": E1, G2, R3, E4, T5? But E at position 4? And T? T is absent? From ""tired"", we know T is absent? So avoid T? Also E at position 4? We know E cannot be in position 4? So guessing E4 is a waste? Also T absent? So ""EGRET"" is not good.\n\n""ELVER"": E1, L2, V3, E4, R5? Position 3: V? We need R at position 3? So no? We must have R at position 3? So the third letter is R? So second letter is what? Then last two?\n\nSo for E1_ R _ _:\n\n""E?R??"": \n\nOptions:\n\n- ""EARLY"": E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5? But A is absent? Avoid.\n\n""EERIE"": duplicate E and I absent? Avoid.\n\n""EKING""? E1,K? K2,R? No: ""EKING"" is E,K,I,N,G? Not E?R pattern? Because R not at position 3? Unless? ""EKING"": E1,K2,I3,N4,G5? No R? Avoid.\n\nHow about ""EVERY"": E1,V2,E3,R4,Y5? But R4? We need R at 3? So no? Because R4? Not pattern.\n\nSo list: Words matching E?R?:\n\n- earth: E,A,R,T,H? But A and T absent? Avoid.\n- eager: E,A,G,E,R? A absent? And duplicate E? Avoid.\n\nIt appears there aren\'t many common words starting with E and R at position 3? Or I may be missing.\n\nTry E with S? ""ESKER"": E1,S2,K3,E4,R5? But position 3 K? We need R? So not.\n\nSo perhaps E at position 2 is easier?\n\nPattern: ? E R ? ?\n\nAnd R at position 3 fixed? So words: _ E R _ _\n\nNow, first position? Must be a consonant? Common.\n\nExamples:\n\n- BERET: B1,E2,R3,E4,T5? But E at position 4? Not allowed? And T absent? Avoid.\n\n- FERAL: F1,E2,R3,A4,L5? A absent? Avoid.\n\n- GERMY? Not common? G1,E2,R3,M4,Y5? Letters G,M,Y? Valid? G is not absent? M new? Y? But ""germy"" is an adjective? Valid? Assume valid? But E in guess at position 2? And R3.\n\nAlso position 4: M? Position 5: Y?\n\nBut the secret word: E is present and should be at position 2? Or if not, then position 1? So if we get feedback on E in position 2: if ✓, then we know? If \'-\' then E must be at position 1? So good.\n\nSimilarly, we test other letters.\n\nBut M and Y? Common?\n\nAnother word: ""HERON"": H1,E2,R3,O4,N5? But n is absent? Avoid.\n\n""LEERY"": L1,E2,E3? But R would be position 4? Not? ""LEERY"" is L1, E2, E3, R4, Y5? Not R at position 3? Pattern _E R _ _: so first letter? and E2, R3? so not leery.\n\n""WEIRD"": W1,E2,I3,R4,D5? Not R3? R at position 4? No: W,E,I,R,D? Position 3 I? No.\n\nA good common word: ""PERKY""? P1,E2,R3, K4,Y5? Letters P, E, R, K, Y? Avoid absent? None? C,A,N,T,I,D absent? P,K,Y? All new? Good.\n\nAlso, ""MERCY"": M1,E2,R3,C4,Y5? But C absent? Avoid C? So not.\n\n""VERVE""? V1,E2,R3,V4,E5? Duplicate V? And E5 not allowed.\n\nSo ""PERKY"" seems good: P,E,R,K,Y? With E at position 2, R at position 3? Tests:\n- P at position 1: if present? position?\n- E at position 2: if correct? we get ✓? Or \'-\' meaning E is at position 1?\n- R at position 3: we know is ✓? So we\'ll get ✓? No change?\n- K at position 4: if present? position?\n- Y at position 5: if present? position?\n\nAlso, the word is common: perky, meaning cheerful.\n\nTherefore, a good guess.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BERYL""? But B1,E2,R3,Y4,L5? Letters B,Y,L? But from ""tired"", D absent? No: B new? Y new? L new? So ok.\n\nBut ""BERYL"" vs ""PERKY""? Both are fine? But I think ""PERKY"" uses K and P? K is common? Slightly more common? Or let\'s pick one.\n\nSince we want to maximize information, ""PERKY"" includes P and K? Both common consonants.\n\nBut also, note that if the secret word is from a common set? We have limited information? So ""PERKY"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""PERKY""Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, D (eliminated via feedback from ""crane"" and ""tired"").\n- **Present Letters**:\n  - R is confirmed at position 3 (✓ from ""tired"").\n  - E is present but incorrect in positions 4 (from ""tired"") and 5 (from ""crane"").\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have the form `_ _ R _ _` (since R is fixed at position 3).\n- Contain E, but only in position 1 or 2 (since E cannot be in positions 3–5 due to feedback).\n- Exclude the absent letters.\n\nFor the next guess, I need:\n- A valid 5-letter English word matching the constraints.\n- To prioritize narrowing E\'s position (testing E in position 2) and introducing new common letters like P, K, or Y for efficiency.\n- To avoid reused absent letters and positions.\n\nI selected ""PERKY"" because:\n- It places R at position 3 (required), E at position 2 (to test its correctness there).\n- It includes new common letters P, K, and Y (untested consonants).\n- It avoids all absent letters and incorrect E positions.\n- If E in ""PERKY"" is ✓ at position 2, E is confirmed there. If not (E gives -), E must be at position 1.\n\nThis guess maximizes positional information and tests high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>perky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(✓) E(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: perky -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
   - Absent: C, A, N
   - R is present but not in position 2.
   - E is present but not in position 5.

2. Guess ""tired"": T(x), I(x), R(✓), E(-), D(x)
   - Absent: T, I, D (plus C, A, N)
   - R is correct at position 3 (so secret word has R at index 3).
   - E is present but not in position 4.

3. Guess ""perky"": P(x), E(✓), R(✓), K(✓), Y(✓)
   - Absent: P (plus C,A,N,T,I,D)
   - E at position 2 is correct (so secret word has E at index 2).
   - R at position 3 is correct (expected).
   - K at position 4 is correct.
   - Y at position 5 is correct.

From this, we now know:
- The secret word has the following pattern: _ E R K Y (because E is at position 2, R at 3, K at 4, Y at 5).
- The first letter is unknown.
- We also know that E is at position 2, so the note from previous guesses about E being present elsewhere doesn't matter because it's fixed here.

The word pattern is: ? E R K Y

We need to fill in the first letter? Which must be a letter that:
- Is not among the absent letters: C, A, N, T, I, D, P.
- Is a valid English letter that can form a word ending with ""ERKY"".

Now, we need to find a valid 5-letter word that matches the pattern ? E R K Y? And guess it? Actually, we know the last four letters are fixed? Only the first letter is missing? So we can list possible words? Or just guess? But we need to guess the full word? Since only one letter is unknown? In fact, we don't know the first letter? But by the pattern, we can have:

- The word must be ?ERKY? Such as ""JERKY"", ""PERKY"" (but we guessed ""PERKY"" and got E(✓),R(✓),K(✓),Y(✓), but P was absent? So ""PERKY"" was guessed but P is absent? Therefore, ""PERKY"" is not the word? Because P(x). So the word is something else? 

Pattern: first letter must be a consonant? And the word ends with ERKY? What words? Common:

- ""JERKY"": J,E,R,K,Y? Meaning: dried meat? Valid.
- ""NERDY"": But N is absent? From guess1? So avoid.
- ""HERKY""? Not common? Not sure.
- ""ZERKY""? Not common.

Possibly: ""JERKY"" is the main common word? But what about ""FERKY""? Not standard? 

Also, we have to avoid absent letters: so J is not absent? We haven't tested J? So it could be ""JERKY"".

Alternatively, ""BERKY""? But B? We don't know? And is it a word? Seems obscure? ""WERKY""? Unlikely.

The only common word is ""JERKY"". 

But note: the feedback for ""perky"": P(x) meaning P is not in the word? So ""perky"" is not the word? But we got E(✓),R(✓),K(✓),Y(✓), meaning we have the last four letters correct? So any guess must have the last four as E,R,K,Y? And the first letter must be a letter that makes a valid word? And that letter is not one of the absent ones? And since P is absent? 

So possible? Only ""JERKY"" comes to mind? Because other options? ""DERKY""? But D is absent? From ""tired"". ""TERKY""? T absent? Etc? 

Therefore, we should guess ""JERKY"". 

But note: is ""JERKY"" the only possibility? What about ""MERKY""? Not a recognized word? I don't think so? ""GERKY""? Uncommon? 

So ""JERKY"" is the typical word.

Thus, our next guess is ""JERKY"". 

But let's confirm: 
- Pattern: J E R K Y? 
- Absent letters? J not in absent? So possible? 

Feedback: from ""perky"", the E,R,K,Y were correct? So if we guess ""JERKY"", we can expect the first letter: if J is correct, then ✓? Or if not, then we might get other feedback? But we know the word? Since we have four positions fixed? 

This should be the answer? But we have 6 tries? So we can guess.

Alternatively, we might consider that the word is not ""JERKY""? But unlikely? Or there are other words? 

In some dictionaries, ""YERKY""? Not standard? So I think ""JERKY"" is it.

Therefore, we guess ""JERKY"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: Eliminated C, A, N; revealed R is present (but not in position 2) and E is present (but not in position 5).
- **Guess 2 (tired)**: Eliminated T, I, D; confirmed R is correctly in position 3; revealed E is not in position 4.
- **Guess 3 (perky)**: Eliminated P; confirmed E is in position 2, R in position 3, K in position 4, and Y in position 5.

The secret word must:
- Match the pattern `_ E R K Y` (since E, R, K, Y are fixed in positions 2–5).
- Exclude all absent letters: **C, A, N, T, I, D, P**.
- Contain a first letter that forms a valid English word with ""ERKY"".

Given these constraints, the only common English word is **""JERKY""** (validated by standard dictionaries). This is the logical solution, as other combinations either:
- Use absent letters (e.g., ""NERKY"" contains N).
- Are not valid words (e.g., ""FERKY"", ""MERKY"").
