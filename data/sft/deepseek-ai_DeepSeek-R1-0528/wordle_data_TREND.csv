We are beginning the game. Since there is no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information. 
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids duplicates to maximize the chance of getting various feedback.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are common in English words.

 Therefore, our first guess is ""RAISE"".

We are making the first guess with no prior feedback. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. 

Optimal first guesses often include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O) to test vowel presence
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground

A strong starting word is ""RAISE"" because:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
2. All letters are distinct
3. High-frequency letters in English 5-letter words
4. Proven effective in similar word games

This guess tests key components of many words and will provide robust feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". 
  Specifically, R is not the first letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
- The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and E (each at least once)
- Must not include A, I, S

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but in wrong positions)
- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 (as per the guess ""raise""), we can try to place R and E in different positions.

Also, we should avoid using any of the absent letters (A, I, S) in the new guess.

Common letters we haven't tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and E.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and no A, I, S.

Possible words: 
- Words with E and R: e.g., ""crepe"", but has repeated E and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicate unless the word has duplicates. However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" showed only R and E as present, so if there were duplicates, we might not know. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, and we have to include R and E, we can try a word that uses other common consonants.

We also want to cover new positions for R and E.

In ""raise"", R was in position 1 (but wrong) and E in position 5 (wrong). So for R, it cannot be in position 1. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5.

We can try placing R in positions 2,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: E could be in position 1? Yes, because we haven't tested that.

Similarly, R could be in 2,3,4,5? But position 5: we haven't tested R in position 5.

Actually, the feedback only says that R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5. They could be in other positions.

We should also test other common letters to get more coverage.

A good second guess might be ""outer"", but let's check:
- ""outer"" has U, T, E, R. 
- It has E at the end (position 5) but we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, we know it will be wrong, but that might be wasteful.

We want to put E in a new position to test. Similarly for R.

Also, we must avoid A, I, S.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and no A, I, S, and with E not in position 5 and R not in position 1.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4
For R: 2,3,4,5

But we don't know the exact positions, so we can try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We haven't tested positions: 2,3,4 for both? Actually, we tested position 1 (R) and 5 (E) and they were wrong.

So let's try a word that has:
- E in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5)
- R in position 2,3,4, or 5 (but not 1)

Also, we want to include other common consonants to test.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

One classic word is ""route"", but let's see:
- ""route"": R in position 1? But we know R cannot be in position 1 (from feedback: R was in position 1 and was wrong). So we cannot put R in position 1 again.

So avoid R in position 1.

Similarly, avoid E in position 5.

So ""route"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

Another word: ""tried"" -> but has I, which is absent. Not allowed.

""store"" -> has S, which is absent. Not allowed.

""crane"" -> has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""blend"" -> no R? We must include R and E.

We need a word that has both R and E.

Let me think: ""enter"" -> has E at position 1 and 4, and R at position 5. But E is at position 5? No, in ""enter"", the letters are: E, N, T, E, R. So position 5 is R, and E is at 1 and 4. But we know E cannot be at position 5? Actually, position 5 is R, so that's okay. But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E's.

But we are allowed to guess duplicate letters? Yes, but in this case, we are testing.

However, we must avoid A, I, S.

""enter"": E, N, T, E, R -> no A, I, S. It has E at positions 1 and 4, and R at 5.

But we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 (from the first guess), but here E is at 1 and 4, and R at 5. So that's okay.

But we also know that R is not at position 1 (which is true, here R is at 5). And E is at 1 and 4: we don't know if E can be at 1? We haven't tested position 1 for E.

In the first guess, we tested R at 1 and E at 5. Now we can test E at 1 and R at 5.

But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 1, that might be correct or not.

Similarly, R at position 5: we don't know if that is allowed.

But we are trying to get information.

Another word: ""berth"" -> B, E, R, T, H. 
- E at position 2, R at position 3. 
- Avoids A, I, S.

This seems good because:
- We test E in position 2 (new position) and R in position 3 (new position).
- We also test new letters: B, T, H.

Similarly, we can consider ""perch"", ""merge"", etc.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters.

Another option: ""tiger"" -> but has I? T,I,G,E,R -> I is absent, so not allowed.

""rover"" -> R at position 1? Not allowed.

""cried"" -> has I, not allowed.

""deter"" -> D, E, T, E, R -> has two E's. But that's okay. E at 2 and 4, R at 5. Avoids A,I,S.

But we are testing E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

We might get less information because of duplicate E.

So perhaps a word without duplicates is better.

""berth"": B, E, R, T, H -> all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""perky"": P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct, but K and Y are less common.

""nerve"": has E repeated? N, E, R, V, E -> two E's.

""merge"": M, E, R, G, E -> two E's.

""liver"": has I, not allowed.

""hover"": H, O, V, E, R -> distinct letters, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

But we know E cannot be at position 5? Here E is at 4 and R at 5. So we are testing E at 4 and R at 5.

But we haven't tested R at 5 before? In the first guess, R was at 1 and E at 5. Now we are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

This is acceptable.

Similarly, ""cover"": has O, V, E, R -> but C? C, O, V, E, R -> but we don't have C in the feedback? But we can test.

But ""cover"" has O and V which are less common? Not necessarily.

But let's look for a word that tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""tuner"" -> T, U, N, E, R -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

Same as above.

But we are testing U and N as well.

Perhaps ""under"": U, N, D, E, R -> distinct, E at 4, R at 5.

But we are repeating the pattern of E and R at the end.

We might want to test E and R in the beginning or middle.

For example, a word with E at position 1: but we haven't tested that.

For instance, ""earth"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""epoch"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> no R? We must include R.

We need R.

""erect"": E, R, E, C, T -> two E's, and R at position 2. 
- But has E at 1 and 3? E at 1, R at 2, then E at 3. 
- Avoids A,I,S.

But duplicate E.

""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 1, R at 2.

This is interesting because we are testing E at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and R at position 2 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test U, P, T.

This seems a good candidate.

Similarly, ""erred"" -> duplicate R and E? Not distinct.

""erupt"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""embed"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> two E's, and no R? We must include R.

So we need R.

After considering, ""erupt"" seems good.

But let's check if there are other words without E at the start? We might not want to put E at the start if it might be wrong, but we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 2 and R in position 4, for example.

Word: ""heart"" -> has A, not allowed.

""peril"" -> has I, not allowed.

""mercy"" -> M, E, R, C, Y -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 2, R at 3.

This is also good.

We have two options: 
1. ""erupt"": E at 1, R at 2, U, P, T
2. ""mercy"": M, E, R, C, Y

Which one tests more common letters? 
- ""erupt"" has E, R, U, P, T -> U and P are medium frequency, T is high.
- ""mercy"" has M, E, R, C, Y -> M, C, Y are medium, but Y is less common at the end.

We might prefer ""erupt"" because it tests E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (2), and T is a common letter.

Also, we haven't tested positions 1 and 2 for any letter except R was in 1 (wrong) and A was in 2 (wrong, and absent). So position 2 is completely new.

In the first guess, position 2 was A (absent), so we don't know what is in position 2.

Similarly, position 1 was R (wrong) so we know it's not R, but could be something else.

So ""erupt"" tests:
- Position 1: E (could be correct? or wrong, but we get feedback)
- Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know)

If we get a ✓ for E at position 1, that would be great. If not, we know E is not at 1.

Similarly for R at position 2.

We also test U, P, T in positions 3,4,5.

Since we have to include R and E, and we are testing them in new positions, this is efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""erupt"" as the second guess.

But note: we must ensure that ""erupt"" is a valid word. Yes, it is a 5-letter English word.

So, second guess: ""erupt""

Let me write the feedback we expect? Not necessary, but for our thought.

We'll get feedback after this guess.

So, to summarize:
- We know the word has R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 (from first guess).
- We are testing E in position 1 and R in position 2, which are new positions for these letters.
- We are also testing U, P, T which are new letters.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""erupt"".
</think>
<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""raise"": 
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- A is absent (x)
- I is absent (x)
- S is absent (x)
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.
2. The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.
3. Therefore, the new guess must:
   - Include R and E (since they are confirmed present).
   - Exclude A, I, S.
   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).
4. Strategy for the second guess:
   - Test new positions for R and E to gather more information. Specifically, try placing E in position 1 (untested) and R in position 2 (untested).
   - Introduce new common consonants (e.g., T, P, U) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid duplicate letters to cover more ground.

A strong candidate is ""erupt"":
- E in position 1 (tests if E is correct there).
- R in position 2 (tests if R is correct there).
- U, P, T are new common letters not yet tested.
- No A, I, S, and all letters are distinct.
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R and E while probing new letters and positions.

Other considered words (like ""mercy"") were rejected due to less optimal letter placement or lower frequency letters.
</thinking>

- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"".

- The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

But we also know that R is not at position 1 (which is true, here R is at 5). And E is at 1 and 4: we don't know if E can be at 1? We haven't tested position 1 for E.

In the first guess, we tested R at 1 and E at 5. Now we can test E at 1 and R at 5.

But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 1, that might be correct or not.

Similarly, R at position 5: we don't know if that is allowed.

But we are trying to get information.

Another word: ""berth"" -> B, E, R, T, H. 
- E at position 2, R at position 3. 
- Avoids A, I, S.

This seems good because:
- We test E in position 2 (new position) and R in position 3 (new position).
- We also test new letters: B, T, H.

Similarly, we can consider ""perch"", ""merge"", etc.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters.

Another option: ""tiger"" -> but has I? T,I,G,E,R -> I is absent, so not allowed.

""rover"" -> R at position 1? Not allowed.

""cried"" -> has I, not allowed.

""deter"" -> D, E, T, E, R -> has two E's. But that's okay. E at 2 and 4, R at 5. Avoids A,I,S.

But we are testing E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

We might get less information because of duplicate E.

So perhaps a word without duplicates is better.

""berth"": B, E, R, T, H -> all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""perky"": P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct, but K and Y are less common.

""nerve"": has E repeated? N, E, R, V, E -> two E's.

""merge"": M, E, R, G, E -> two E's.

""liver"": has I, not allowed.

""hover"": H, O, V, E, R -> distinct letters, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

But we know E cannot be at position 5? Here E is at 4 and R at 5. So we are testing E at 4 and R at 5.

But we haven't tested R at 5 before? In the first guess, R was at 1 and E at 5. Now we are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

This is acceptable.

Similarly, ""cover"": has O, V, E, R -> but C? C, O, V, E, R -> but we don't have C in the feedback? But we can test.

But ""cover"" has O and V which are less common? Not necessarily.

But let's look for a word that tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""tuner"" -> T, U, N, E, R -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

Same as above.

But we are testing U and N as well.

Perhaps ""under"": U, N, D, E, R -> distinct, E at 4, R at 5.

But we are repeating the pattern of E and R at the end.

We might want to test E and R in the beginning or middle.

For example, a word with E at position 1: but we haven't tested that.

For instance, ""earth"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""epoch"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> no R? We must include R.

We need R.

""erect"": E, R, E, C, T -> two E's, and R at position 2. 
- But has E at 1 and 3? E at 1, R at 2, then E at 3. 
- Avoids A,I,S.

But duplicate E.

""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 1, R at 2.

This is interesting because we are testing E at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and R at position 2 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test U, P, T.

This seems a good candidate.

Similarly, ""erred"" -> duplicate R and E? Not distinct.

""erupt"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""embed"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> two E's, and no R? We must include R.

So we need R.

After considering, ""erupt"" seems good.

But let's check if there are other words without E at the start? We might not want to put E at the start if it might be wrong, but we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 2 and R in position 4, for example.

Word: ""heart"" -> has A, not allowed.

""peril"" -> has I, not allowed.

""mercy"" -> M, E, R, C, Y -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 2, R at 3.

This is also good.

We have two options: 
1. ""erupt"": E at 1, R at 2, U, P, T
2. ""mercy"": M, E, R, C, Y

Which one tests more common letters? 
- ""erupt"" has E, R, U, P, T -> U and P are medium frequency, T is high.
- ""mercy"" has M, E, R, C, Y -> M, C, Y are medium, but Y is less common at the end.

We might prefer ""erupt"" because it tests E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (2), and T is a common letter.

Also, we haven't tested positions 1 and 2 for any letter except R was in 1 (wrong) and A was in 2 (wrong, and absent). So position 2 is completely new.

In the first guess, position 2 was A (absent), so we don't know what is in position 2.

Similarly, position 1 was R (wrong) so we know it's not R, but could be something else.

So ""erupt"" tests:
- Position 1: E (could be correct? or wrong, but we get feedback)
- Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know)

If we get a ✓ for E at position 1, that would be great. If not, we know E is not at 1.

Similarly for R at position 2.

We also test U, P, T in positions 3,4,5.

Since we have to include R and E, and we are testing them in new positions, this is efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""erupt"" as the second guess.

But note: we must ensure that ""erupt"" is a valid word. Yes, it is a 5-letter English word.

So, second guess: ""erupt""

Let me write the feedback we expect? Not necessary, but for our thought.

We'll get feedback after this guess.

So, to summarize:
- We know the word has R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 (from first guess).
- We are testing E in position 1 and R in position 2, which are new positions for these letters.
- We are also testing U, P, T which are new letters.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""erupt"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""raise"": 
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- A is absent (x)
- I is absent (x)
- S is absent (x)
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.
2. The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.
3. Therefore, the new guess must:
   - Include R and E (since they are confirmed present).
   - Exclude A, I, S.
   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).
4. Strategy for the second guess:
   - Test new positions for R and E to gather more information. Specifically, try placing E in position 1 (untested) and R in position 2 (untested).
   - Introduce new common consonants (e.g., T, P, U) to maximize information gain.
   - Avoid duplicate letters to cover more ground.

A strong candidate is ""erupt"":
- E in position 1 (tests if E is correct there).
- R in position 2 (tests if R is correct there).
- U, P, T are new common letters not yet tested.
- No A, I, S, and all letters are distinct.
- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R and E while probing new letters and positions.

Other considered words (like ""mercy"") were rejected due to less optimal letter placement or lower frequency letters.
</thinking>",Guess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,TREND,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are beginning the game. Since there is no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information. 
 A good starting word typically has common letters and avoids duplicates to maximize the chance of getting various feedback.
 Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has the letters R, A, I, S, E which are common in English words.

 Therefore, our first guess is ""RAISE"".<thinking>
We are making the first guess with no prior feedback. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. 

Optimal first guesses often include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O) to test vowel presence
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground

A strong starting word is ""RAISE"" because:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
2. All letters are distinct
3. High-frequency letters in English 5-letter words
4. Proven effective in similar word games

This guess tests key components of many words and will provide robust feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":
- R: present but in the wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: present but in the wrong position (-)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". 
  Specifically, R is not the first letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
- The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include R and E (each at least once)
- Must not include A, I, S

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but in wrong positions)
- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 (as per the guess ""raise""), we can try to place R and E in different positions.

Also, we should avoid using any of the absent letters (A, I, S) in the new guess.

Common letters we haven't tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and E.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and no A, I, S.

Possible words: 
- Words with E and R: e.g., ""crepe"", but has repeated E and we don't know if repetition is allowed? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicate unless the word has duplicates. However, we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" showed only R and E as present, so if there were duplicates, we might not know. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, and we have to include R and E, we can try a word that uses other common consonants.

We also want to cover new positions for R and E.

In ""raise"", R was in position 1 (but wrong) and E in position 5 (wrong). So for R, it cannot be in position 1. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5.

We can try placing R in positions 2,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).

But note: E could be in position 1? Yes, because we haven't tested that.

Similarly, R could be in 2,3,4,5? But position 5: we haven't tested R in position 5.

Actually, the feedback only says that R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5. They could be in other positions.

We should also test other common letters to get more coverage.

A good second guess might be ""outer"", but let's check:
- ""outer"" has U, T, E, R. 
- It has E at the end (position 5) but we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, we know it will be wrong, but that might be wasteful.

We want to put E in a new position to test. Similarly for R.

Also, we must avoid A, I, S.

Let me list some words that have R and E, and no A, I, S, and with E not in position 5 and R not in position 1.

Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4
For R: 2,3,4,5

But we don't know the exact positions, so we can try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We haven't tested positions: 2,3,4 for both? Actually, we tested position 1 (R) and 5 (E) and they were wrong.

So let's try a word that has:
- E in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5)
- R in position 2,3,4, or 5 (but not 1)

Also, we want to include other common consonants to test.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

One classic word is ""route"", but let's see:
- ""route"": R in position 1? But we know R cannot be in position 1 (from feedback: R was in position 1 and was wrong). So we cannot put R in position 1 again.

So avoid R in position 1.

Similarly, avoid E in position 5.

So ""route"" is invalid because R is in position 1.

Another word: ""tried"" -> but has I, which is absent. Not allowed.

""store"" -> has S, which is absent. Not allowed.

""crane"" -> has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""blend"" -> no R? We must include R and E.

We need a word that has both R and E.

Let me think: ""enter"" -> has E at position 1 and 4, and R at position 5. But E is at position 5? No, in ""enter"", the letters are: E, N, T, E, R. So position 5 is R, and E is at 1 and 4. But we know E cannot be at position 5? Actually, position 5 is R, so that's okay. But we have two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate E's.

But we are allowed to guess duplicate letters? Yes, but in this case, we are testing.

However, we must avoid A, I, S.

""enter"": E, N, T, E, R -> no A, I, S. It has E at positions 1 and 4, and R at 5.

But we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 (from the first guess), but here E is at 1 and 4, and R at 5. So that's okay.

But we also know that R is not at position 1 (which is true, here R is at 5). And E is at 1 and 4: we don't know if E can be at 1? We haven't tested position 1 for E.

In the first guess, we tested R at 1 and E at 5. Now we can test E at 1 and R at 5.

But note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 1, that might be correct or not.

Similarly, R at position 5: we don't know if that is allowed.

But we are trying to get information.

Another word: ""berth"" -> B, E, R, T, H. 
- E at position 2, R at position 3. 
- Avoids A, I, S.

This seems good because:
- We test E in position 2 (new position) and R in position 3 (new position).
- We also test new letters: B, T, H.

Similarly, we can consider ""perch"", ""merge"", etc.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters.

Another option: ""tiger"" -> but has I? T,I,G,E,R -> I is absent, so not allowed.

""rover"" -> R at position 1? Not allowed.

""cried"" -> has I, not allowed.

""deter"" -> D, E, T, E, R -> has two E's. But that's okay. E at 2 and 4, R at 5. Avoids A,I,S.

But we are testing E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.

We might get less information because of duplicate E.

So perhaps a word without duplicates is better.

""berth"": B, E, R, T, H -> all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""perky"": P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct, but K and Y are less common.

""nerve"": has E repeated? N, E, R, V, E -> two E's.

""merge"": M, E, R, G, E -> two E's.

""liver"": has I, not allowed.

""hover"": H, O, V, E, R -> distinct letters, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

But we know E cannot be at position 5? Here E is at 4 and R at 5. So we are testing E at 4 and R at 5.

But we haven't tested R at 5 before? In the first guess, R was at 1 and E at 5. Now we are testing R at 5 and E at 4.

This is acceptable.

Similarly, ""cover"": has O, V, E, R -> but C? C, O, V, E, R -> but we don't have C in the feedback? But we can test.

But ""cover"" has O and V which are less common? Not necessarily.

But let's look for a word that tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""tuner"" -> T, U, N, E, R -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at position 4, R at position 5.

Same as above.

But we are testing U and N as well.

Perhaps ""under"": U, N, D, E, R -> distinct, E at 4, R at 5.

But we are repeating the pattern of E and R at the end.

We might want to test E and R in the beginning or middle.

For example, a word with E at position 1: but we haven't tested that.

For instance, ""earth"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""epoch"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> no R? We must include R.

We need R.

""erect"": E, R, E, C, T -> two E's, and R at position 2. 
- But has E at 1 and 3? E at 1, R at 2, then E at 3. 
- Avoids A,I,S.

But duplicate E.

""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 1, R at 2.

This is interesting because we are testing E at position 1 (which we haven't tested) and R at position 2 (which we haven't tested). Also, we test U, P, T.

This seems a good candidate.

Similarly, ""erred"" -> duplicate R and E? Not distinct.

""erupt"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""embed"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> two E's, and no R? We must include R.

So we need R.

After considering, ""erupt"" seems good.

But let's check if there are other words without E at the start? We might not want to put E at the start if it might be wrong, but we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E in position 2 and R in position 4, for example.

Word: ""heart"" -> has A, not allowed.

""peril"" -> has I, not allowed.

""mercy"" -> M, E, R, C, Y -> distinct, no A,I,S. 
- E at 2, R at 3.

This is also good.

We have two options: 
1. ""erupt"": E at 1, R at 2, U, P, T
2. ""mercy"": M, E, R, C, Y

Which one tests more common letters? 
- ""erupt"" has E, R, U, P, T -> U and P are medium frequency, T is high.
- ""mercy"" has M, E, R, C, Y -> M, C, Y are medium, but Y is less common at the end.

We might prefer ""erupt"" because it tests E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (2), and T is a common letter.

Also, we haven't tested positions 1 and 2 for any letter except R was in 1 (wrong) and A was in 2 (wrong, and absent). So position 2 is completely new.

In the first guess, position 2 was A (absent), so we don't know what is in position 2.

Similarly, position 1 was R (wrong) so we know it's not R, but could be something else.

So ""erupt"" tests:
- Position 1: E (could be correct? or wrong, but we get feedback)
- Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don't know)

If we get a ✓ for E at position 1, that would be great. If not, we know E is not at 1.

Similarly for R at position 2.

We also test U, P, T in positions 3,4,5.

Since we have to include R and E, and we are testing them in new positions, this is efficient.

Therefore, I choose ""erupt"" as the second guess.

But note: we must ensure that ""erupt"" is a valid word. Yes, it is a 5-letter English word.

So, second guess: ""erupt""

Let me write the feedback we expect? Not necessary, but for our thought.

We'll get feedback after this guess.

So, to summarize:
- We know the word has R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 (from first guess).
- We are testing E in position 1 and R in position 2, which are new positions for these letters.
- We are also testing U, P, T which are new letters.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""erupt"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""raise"": 
- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- A is absent (x)
- I is absent (x)
- S is absent (x)
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.

3. Therefore, the new guess must:
   - Include R and E (since they are confirmed present).

- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R and E while probing new letters and positions.

Other considered words (like ""mercy"") were rejected due to less optimal letter placement or lower frequency letters.

Proven effective in similar word games\n\nThis guess tests key components of many words and will provide robust feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""raise"":\n- R: present but in the wrong position (-)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- I: not in the word (x)\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- E: present but in the wrong position (-)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". \n  Specifically, R is not the first letter, and E is not the fifth letter.\n- The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Must include R and E (each at least once)\n- Must not include A, I, S\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain A, I, S (since they are absent)\n- Includes R and E (since they are present, but in wrong positions)\n- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nSince R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 (as per the guess ""raise""), we can try to place R and E in different positions.\n\nAlso, we should avoid using any of the absent letters (A, I, S) in the new guess.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters and must contain R and E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have R and E, and no A, I, S.\n\nPossible words: \n- Words with E and R: e.g., ""crepe"", but has repeated E and we don\'t know if repetition is allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we assume no duplicate unless the word has duplicates. However, we don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""raise"" showed only R and E as present, so if there were duplicates, we might not know. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, and we have to include R and E, we can try a word that uses other common consonants.\n\nWe also want to cover new positions for R and E.\n\nIn ""raise"", R was in position 1 (but wrong) and E in position 5 (wrong). So for R, it cannot be in position 1. Similarly, E cannot be in position 5.\n\nWe can try placing R in positions 2,3,4 and E in positions 1,2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\nBut note: E could be in position 1? Yes, because we haven\'t tested that.\n\nSimilarly, R could be in 2,3,4,5? But position 5: we haven\'t tested R in position 5.\n\nActually, the feedback only says that R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5. They could be in other positions.\n\nWe should also test other common letters to get more coverage.\n\nA good second guess might be ""outer"", but let\'s check:\n- ""outer"" has U, T, E, R. \n- It has E at the end (position 5) but we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, we know it will be wrong, but that might be wasteful.\n\nWe want to put E in a new position to test. Similarly for R.\n\nAlso, we must avoid A, I, S.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and E, and no A, I, S, and with E not in position 5 and R not in position 1.\n\nPossible positions for E: 1,2,3,4\nFor R: 2,3,4,5\n\nBut we don\'t know the exact positions, so we can try to put them in positions we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested positions: 2,3,4 for both? Actually, we tested position 1 (R) and 5 (E) and they were wrong.\n\nSo let\'s try a word that has:\n- E in position 1,2,3, or 4 (but not 5)\n- R in position 2,3,4, or 5 (but not 1)\n\nAlso, we want to include other common consonants to test.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nOne classic word is ""route"", but let\'s see:\n- ""route"": R in position 1? But we know R cannot be in position 1 (from feedback: R was in position 1 and was wrong). So we cannot put R in position 1 again.\n\nSo avoid R in position 1.\n\nSimilarly, avoid E in position 5.\n\nSo ""route"" is invalid because R is in position 1.\n\nAnother word: ""tried"" -> but has I, which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""store"" -> has S, which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""crane"" -> has A, which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""blend"" -> no R? We must include R and E.\n\nWe need a word that has both R and E.\n\nLet me think: ""enter"" -> has E at position 1 and 4, and R at position 5. But E is at position 5? No, in ""enter"", the letters are: E, N, T, E, R. So position 5 is R, and E is at 1 and 4. But we know E cannot be at position 5? Actually, position 5 is R, so that\'s okay. But we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate E\'s.\n\nBut we are allowed to guess duplicate letters? Yes, but in this case, we are testing.\n\nHowever, we must avoid A, I, S.\n\n""enter"": E, N, T, E, R -> no A, I, S. It has E at positions 1 and 4, and R at 5.\n\nBut we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 (from the first guess), but here E is at 1 and 4, and R at 5. So that\'s okay.\n\nBut we also know that R is not at position 1 (which is true, here R is at 5). And E is at 1 and 4: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? We haven\'t tested position 1 for E.\n\nIn the first guess, we tested R at 1 and E at 5. Now we can test E at 1 and R at 5.\n\nBut note: the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 1, that might be correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 5: we don\'t know if that is allowed.\n\nBut we are trying to get information.\n\nAnother word: ""berth"" -> B, E, R, T, H. \n- E at position 2, R at position 3. \n- Avoids A, I, S.\n\nThis seems good because:\n- We test E in position 2 (new position) and R in position 3 (new position).\n- We also test new letters: B, T, H.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider ""perch"", ""merge"", etc.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""tiger"" -> but has I? T,I,G,E,R -> I is absent, so not allowed.\n\n""rover"" -> R at position 1? Not allowed.\n\n""cried"" -> has I, not allowed.\n\n""deter"" -> D, E, T, E, R -> has two E\'s. But that\'s okay. E at 2 and 4, R at 5. Avoids A,I,S.\n\nBut we are testing E at 2 and 4, and R at 5.\n\nWe might get less information because of duplicate E.\n\nSo perhaps a word without duplicates is better.\n\n""berth"": B, E, R, T, H -> all distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""perky"": P, E, R, K, Y -> distinct, but K and Y are less common.\n\n""nerve"": has E repeated? N, E, R, V, E -> two E\'s.\n\n""merge"": M, E, R, G, E -> two E\'s.\n\n""liver"": has I, not allowed.\n\n""hover"": H, O, V, E, R -> distinct letters, no A,I,S. \n- E at position 4, R at position 5.\n\nBut we know E cannot be at position 5? Here E is at 4 and R at 5. So we are testing E at 4 and R at 5.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested R at 5 before? In the first guess, R was at 1 and E at 5. Now we are testing R at 5 and E at 4.\n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""cover"": has O, V, E, R -> but C? C, O, V, E, R -> but we don\'t have C in the feedback? But we can test.\n\nBut ""cover"" has O and V which are less common? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s look for a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""tuner"" -> T, U, N, E, R -> distinct, no A,I,S. \n- E at position 4, R at position 5.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut we are testing U and N as well.\n\nPerhaps ""under"": U, N, D, E, R -> distinct, E at 4, R at 5.\n\nBut we are repeating the pattern of E and R at the end.\n\nWe might want to test E and R in the beginning or middle.\n\nFor example, a word with E at position 1: but we haven\'t tested that.\n\nFor instance, ""earth"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""epoch"" -> E, P, O, C, H -> no R? We must include R.\n\nWe need R.\n\n""erect"": E, R, E, C, T -> two E\'s, and R at position 2. \n- But has E at 1 and 3? E at 1, R at 2, then E at 3. \n- Avoids A,I,S.\n\nBut duplicate E.\n\n""erupt"": E, R, U, P, T -> distinct, no A,I,S. \n- E at 1, R at 2.\n\nThis is interesting because we are testing E at position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and R at position 2 (which we haven\'t tested). Also, we test U, P, T.\n\nThis seems a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""erred"" -> duplicate R and E? Not distinct.\n\n""erupt"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""embed"" -> E, M, B, E, D -> two E\'s, and no R? We must include R.\n\nSo we need R.\n\nAfter considering, ""erupt"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words without E at the start? We might not want to put E at the start if it might be wrong, but we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E in position 2 and R in position 4, for example.\n\nWord: ""heart"" -> has A, not allowed.\n\n""peril"" -> has I, not allowed.\n\n""mercy"" -> M, E, R, C, Y -> distinct, no A,I,S. \n- E at 2, R at 3.\n\nThis is also good.\n\nWe have two options: \n1. ""erupt"": E at 1, R at 2, U, P, T\n2. ""mercy"": M, E, R, C, Y\n\nWhich one tests more common letters? \n- ""erupt"" has E, R, U, P, T -> U and P are medium frequency, T is high.\n- ""mercy"" has M, E, R, C, Y -> M, C, Y are medium, but Y is less common at the end.\n\nWe might prefer ""erupt"" because it tests E at a new position (1) and R at a new position (2), and T is a common letter.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 2 for any letter except R was in 1 (wrong) and A was in 2 (wrong, and absent). So position 2 is completely new.\n\nIn the first guess, position 2 was A (absent), so we don\'t know what is in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 was R (wrong) so we know it\'s not R, but could be something else.\n\nSo ""erupt"" tests:\n- Position 1: E (could be correct? or wrong, but we get feedback)\n- Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but is it in position 2? We don\'t know)\n\nIf we get a ✓ for E at position 1, that would be great. If not, we know E is not at 1.\n\nSimilarly for R at position 2.\n\nWe also test U, P, T in positions 3,4,5.\n\nSince we have to include R and E, and we are testing them in new positions, this is efficient.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""erupt"" as the second guess.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that ""erupt"" is a valid word. Yes, it is a 5-letter English word.\n\nSo, second guess: ""erupt""\n\nLet me write the feedback we expect? Not necessary, but for our thought.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback after this guess.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- We know the word has R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 (from first guess).\n- We are testing E in position 1 and R in position 2, which are new positions for these letters.\n- We are also testing U, P, T which are new letters.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""erupt"".<thinking>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""raise"": \n- R is present but not in position 1 (marked as -)\n- A is absent (x)\n- I is absent (x)\n- S is absent (x)\n- E is present but not in position 5 (marked as -)\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.\n2. The letters A, I, and S are not in the word at all.\n3. Therefore, the new guess must:\n   - Include R and E (since they are confirmed present).\n   - Exclude A, I, S.\n   - Place R in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n4. Strategy for the second guess:\n   - Test new positions for R and E to gather more information. Specifically, try placing E in position 1 (untested) and R in position 2 (untested).\n   - Introduce new common consonants (e.g., T, P, U) to maximize information gain.\n   - Avoid duplicate letters to cover more ground.\n\nA strong candidate is ""erupt"":\n- E in position 1 (tests if E is correct there).\n- R in position 2 (tests if R is correct there).\n- U, P, T are new common letters not yet tested.\n- No A, I, S, and all letters are distinct.\n- This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R and E while probing new letters and positions.\n\nOther considered words (like ""mercy"") were rejected due to less optimal letter placement or lower frequency letters.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>erupt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess ""raise"":
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-)

Second guess ""erupt"":
- E: present but wrong position (-)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- P: absent (x)
- T: present but wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. From ""raise"":
   - The word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.
   - The word does not contain A, I, S.

2. From ""erupt"":
   - R is in the correct position at position 2. So the second letter of the secret word is R.
   - E is present but not in position 1 (since we got - for E at position 1).
   - T is present but not in position 5 (since we got - for T at position 5).
   - U and P are absent.

Therefore, we now know:
- The second letter is R (fixed).
- The word contains E and T (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- The word does not contain: A, I, S, U, P.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not in position 5, and from the second guess, E is not in position 1. So E must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, T is present but not in position 5 (from second guess). We don't know about other positions for T.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the letters in the word: R (at position 2), E, T, and two more letters that are not A, I, S, U, P.

We also know the word does not contain the absent letters: A, I, S, U, P.

We have to find a word that fits:
- Position 2: R
- Contains E (must be in position 3 or 4)
- Contains T (not in position 5, so in 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 3 and 4 might be taken by E or T, or others)

But E must be in 3 or 4, so T cannot be in the same position as E. So T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if E is in 3, T can be in 1 or 4, and vice versa.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

Let's list the known absent letters: A, I, S, U, P.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, U, P, T.

So remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that:
- Second letter is R
- Contains E and T
- Does not contain A, I, S, U, P
- E must be in position 3 or 4
- T must not be in position 5 (so in 1, 3, or 4, but if in 3 or 4, it must be the other one from E)

We can try to form such words.

Possible positions:

Case 1: E in position 3
Then the word is: _ R E _ _
T must be in position 1 or 4 (since not 5, and 3 is taken by E).
Also, we need one more letter for position 4 if T is in 1, or for position 1 if T is in 4, and then position 5.

Case 2: E in position 4
Then the word is: _ R _ E _
T must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 5, and 4 is taken by E).

We can list possible words.

First, let's consider case 1: E in position 3 -> _ R E _ _

Subcase 1a: T in position 1 -> T R E _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A,I,S,U,P, and must be valid English word.

Possible words: 
- treed? But has E at 4? T R E E D -> but we have two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""treed"" has E at 3 and 4. But we know E is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. But in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present, so it could be that the word has only one E? Not necessarily, because if the word has two E's, the feedback for ""raise"" would still show E as present (but not at position 5). Similarly, in ""erupt"", we had E at 1 and it was present but wrong position, but if the word has two E's, that's fine.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

However, we are trying to guess, so we can include duplicates if necessary.

But let's see if there are words without duplicates.

""tread"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""trek"" -> only 4 letters? No, 5-letter: ""treks"" but has S, absent. Not allowed.

""trench"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""trend"" -> T R E N D -> N and D are new, and no A,I,S,U,P. This is a valid word.

""tress"" -> has S, not allowed.

""trest"" -> not a common word, and has two T's? T R E S T -> but S is absent. Not allowed.

So ""trend"" is a candidate: T R E N D.

But we have E in position 3, which is allowed.

Now, subcase 1b: T in position 4 -> _ R E T _
So the word is ? R E T ?

We need first and last letter, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words: 
- ""greta"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""crest"" -> has S, not allowed.
- ""frets"" -> has S, not allowed.
- ""treat"" -> has A and T at the beginning? T R E A T -> but A is absent, and also T at position 1 and 4? But we are looking for T at position 4, so first letter cannot be T? In this subcase, T is at 4, so first letter is not T. The word is ? R E T ?

""brett"" -> B R E T T -> two T's, and last letter T? But we have T at position 4 and 5? But we know T is not in position 5 (from feedback of ""erupt"": T at position 5 was marked - meaning present but wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5). Therefore, T cannot be at position 5. So ""brett"" has T at 5, which is invalid.

""dregs"" -> D R E G S -> has S, not allowed.

""wrest"" -> W R E S T -> has S, not allowed.

""prexy"" -> not common, but P is absent? P is absent, so not allowed.

It seems hard to find a word for this subcase.

Now, case 2: E in position 4 -> _ R _ E _

Subcase 2a: T in position 1 -> T R _ E _
We need a letter for position 3 and 5, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words:
- ""trode"" -> T R O D E -> E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 (from first guess: E was at 5 and was wrong). So E at 5 is invalid. But in ""trode"", E is at 5? So not allowed.

""trice"" -> has I, not allowed.

""trite"" -> has I, not allowed.

""truce"" -> has U, not allowed.

""trope"" -> has P, not allowed.

""trone"" -> T R O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""trume"" -> not a word.

""twere"" -> T W E R E -> but E at 3 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed, and also R is at position 4? But we have R at position 2 fixed. ""twere"" is T W E R E -> positions: 1:T, 2:W, 3:E, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need position 2 to be R, but here it's W. So not.

We need position 2 to be R, so it must be T R ? E ?

But E at 5 is forbidden, so the last letter cannot be E.

So words like ""tribe"" has I and E at 5? Not allowed.

Hard to find.

Subcase 2b: T in position 3 -> _ R T E _
So the word is ? R T E ?

We need first and last letter, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words:
- ""crate"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""write"" -> has I, not allowed.
- ""grate"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""brute"" -> has U, not allowed.
- ""trite"" -> has I, not allowed.
- ""deter"" -> D E T E R -> but E at position 2? We have position 2 fixed as R, so it must be ? R T E ? so first letter and last letter.

""deter"" is D E T E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need position 2 to be R, but it's E. So not.

We need the form: [letter] R T E [letter]

Examples: 
- ""brute"" -> B R U T E -> but U is absent, and E at 5? Also, T is at 4? We have T at position 3? In ""brute"": 1:B, 2:R, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> but we need T at position 3, but here it's at 4. So not.

We need T at position 3: so ? R T E ?

""artel"" -> has A, not allowed.

""irtel"" -> not a word, and has I.

""orten"" -> not common, but O R T E N -> O at 1, N at 5. No A,I,S,U,P. This might be a word? Orten is not standard. 

""brent"" -> B R E N T -> but E is at position 3? We are in case 2, so E should be at position 4. In ""brent"": 1:B, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:T -> so E is at 3, not 4. So not.

We need E at position 4: so the word is ? R ? E ? and we are putting T at position 3: so ? R T E ?

So the fourth letter is E, and third is T.

So words: 
- ""acted"" -> but A, and not starting with ? R.

We need the second letter R and third T, fourth E.

So: [letter] R T E [letter]

With the last letter not E (since E not at 5) and not T (since T not at 5, from feedback).

Also, the first letter not R (we know R is at 2, so first cannot be R? Actually, R could be elsewhere? But we have R at position 2, so if first is R, then we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

But let's see: if the word has two R's, then in the first guess, R was marked present (but wrong position) and in the second guess, R at position 2 was correct. So if there is another R, it might be in another position. But we don't have information about that.

However, for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple, but we should not rule out.

But in this case, for the word pattern ? R T E ?, the first letter cannot be R because then we have R at 1 and 2, which is possible but let's see if there are words.

""rrted"" not a word.

So probably first letter is not R.

Now, possible words: 
- ""orte"" is not 5 letters.

""route"" -> R O U T E -> but U is absent, and E at 5? Not.

""write"" -> W R I T E -> has I, and E at 5? Not.

""crete"" -> C R E T E -> E at 3 and 5? But E at 5 not allowed, and T at 4? We need T at 3, but here T at 4. Not.

""trite"" -> T R I T E -> has I, and E at 5? Not.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: what about ""trench"" but too long.

Back to case 1: we had ""trend"" as a candidate: T R E N D.

In ""trend"":
- T at position 1: we don't know if T can be at 1? We have no feedback against T at 1.
- R at position 2: correct (we know it must be R, and it is)
- E at position 3: we know E must be in 3 or 4, so 3 is allowed.
- N at position 4: new letter.
- D at position 5: new letter.

Also, no A,I,S,U,P.

And T is present and not at 5, which is satisfied.

Now, is there another candidate?

What about E in position 4? We had trouble finding words.

Another word for case 2: E in position 4 and T in position 1: T R ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5, and position 5 cannot be E.

For example, ""trode"" has E at 5, not allowed.

""trice"" has I.

But what about ""trike""? Has I? T R I K E -> has I and E at 5? Not allowed.

""trace"" has A and E at 5? Not.

""trope"" has P? Not.

""truce"" has U? Not.

So no.

With T in position 3: ? R T E ?

For example, ""brite"" -> B R I T E -> has I and E at 5? Not.

""crate"" has A.

""grate"" has A.

""wrote"" -> W R O T E -> but T at position 4? We need T at position 3, but here T at 4. And E at 5? Not.

We need T at 3: so the word must have ... R T E ...

Like ""artist"" but has A, S, and 5 letters? ""artist"" is 6? A R T I S T -> 6 letters? No, 5: A R T I S -> but has A, I, S.

Not.

""dirty"" -> D I R T Y -> has I, and R at position 2? D I R T Y -> position 2 is I, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

So it must be [consonant] R T E [consonant]

But English words like that are rare.

""forte"" -> F O R T E -> but R at position 3? We need R at 2. F O R T E -> 1:F, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T, 5:E -> not R at 2.

So not.

Therefore, the most plausible candidate from case 1 is ""trend"".

But we have another possibility: E in position 3 and T in position 4? We tried and found no good word, but let's list again.

_ R E T _

With last letter not E, not T (since T not at 5), and not A,I,S,U,P.

So last letter must be one of B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we need a word: e.g., ""tret"" is not 5 letters.

""greta"" has A.

Perhaps ""brett"" but T at 5 not allowed.

""crete"" has E at 5? C R E T E -> 5 letters? C R E T E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:T, 5:E -> but E at 5 not allowed, and also duplicate E.

Not.

So no.

Therefore, ""trend"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to consider that T might be in position 3 or 4 if E is in the other.

In ""trend"", T is at 1, E at 3.

We also have the possibility that E is at 4 and T at 1, but we couldn't find a word.

Another word: what about ""freed""? But has E at 1 and 2? F R E E D -> but position 2 is R, so F R E E D -> E at 3 and 4? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so that's possible. But we have two E's? And T is not in the word? But we know T is present, so ""freed"" does not have T. So not.

Similarly, ""green"" has no T.

We must have T.

Another candidate: ""tried"" but has I.

Not.

""trees"" has S and E at 5? Not.

So ""trend"" seems the best.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if ""trend"" is the word.

But we don't know, we are guessing.

We can also consider other words with E in position 4 and T in position 3.

For example, ""wryte"" not a word.

""cried"" has I.

Perhaps we missed ""deter"", but position 2 is E, not R.

Another idea: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, ""beret"" -> B E R E T -> but position 2 is E, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

""merry"" -> M E R R Y -> position 2 is E, not R.

Not.

So I think ""trend"" is a good guess.

But we have to make sure that T at position 1 is possible. We have no feedback against T at 1.

Similarly, in ""trend"", we have N and D which are new.

We could guess ""trench"" but it's 6 letters.

No.

Another word: ""trent"" -> T R E N T -> but T at position 1 and 5? But we know T is not at position 5 (from feedback: T at 5 was marked - meaning present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 5). Therefore, ""trent"" has T at 5, which is invalid.

So not.

Therefore, ""trend"" is valid.

We could also consider ""brent"", but in ""brent"": B R E N T -> E at position 3, which is case 1 with T at 5? But T at 5 is not allowed. So ""brent"" has T at 5, invalid.

Similarly, ""rents"" has S.

So ""trend"" seems the only common word.

Another possibility: what about E in position 4 and T in position 1? We need a word T R ? E ? with ? not E and not A,I,S,U,P.

For example, ""trode"" not allowed because E at 5.

""trone"" E at 5.

""troke"" not common, and E? T R O K E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""trine"" has I and E at 5? Not.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""trend"" is the best guess.

But let's see if there is a word with E in position 4 and T in position 3.

For example, ""wrote"" has T at 4, not 3.

""rite"" is 4 letters.

""arter"" has A and R at 5? A R T E R -> but A absent, and R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 2 fixed, so if R at 5, that's another R. But A is absent.

Not.

So I think we should go with ""trend"".

But we have another candidate: from the second guess feedback, we know R is at position 2, E is present but not at 1, T is present but not at 5.

We also know the word must have exactly 5 letters.

Another word: ""crepe"" has C R E P E -> but P is absent, and E at 5? Not.

""dregs"" has S.

So ""trend"" is good.

Perhaps ""greed"" but no T and E at 5? Not.

Therefore, I choose ""trend"" as the third guess.

But note: we are not sure if E is in position 3 or 4, but in ""trend"" we are testing E in position 3.

If it's wrong, we will know E must be in position 4, and then we can adjust.

Similarly, we are testing T in position 1.

So it's a good test.

Thus, the third guess is ""trend"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R (present, wrong position), A (absent), I (absent), S (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - The word contains R and E, but R is not in position 1, and E is not in position 5.  
  - A, I, and S are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""erupt""** → E (present, wrong position), R (correct position), U (absent), P (absent), T (present, wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (so the word has the form `_ R _ _ _`).  
  - E is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong in position 1).  
  - T is present but not in position 5 (since it was marked wrong in position 5).  
  - U and P are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - R is in position 2.  
  - E and T are present but not in positions 1 or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, U, P (cannot appear in the word).  
- **E's position**: Since E cannot be in position 1 (from ""erupt"") or 5 (from ""raise""), it must be in position 3 or 4.  
- **T's position**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""erupt""), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4. However, if E is in position 3, T cannot also be in position 3 (unless duplicated, but no evidence of duplicates yet), so T would be in 1 or 4. If E is in position 4, T would be in 1 or 3.  
- **Untested letters**: We need to test new common consonants (e.g., D, N, L, M) to gather more information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that fits the constraints:  
  - Position 2 must be R.  
  - Includes E and T.  
  - E in position 3 or 4 (testing position 3 in this guess).  
  - T in a new position (testing position 1).  
  - Avoids absent letters (A, I, S, U, P).  
- ""trend"" is a strong candidate:  
  - `T R E N D` → Tests T in position 1 (new position for T), E in position 3 (plausible for E), and introduces new common letters (N and D).  
  - If correct, it solves the word. If not, the feedback will clarify E and T positions and test N/D.  

<guess>trend</guess>",trend,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess ""raise"":
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-)

Second guess ""erupt"":
- E: present but wrong position (-)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- P: absent (x)
- T: present but wrong position (-)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. From ""raise"":
   - The word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 or 5.
   - The word does not contain A, I, S.

2. From ""erupt"":
   - R is in the correct position at position 2. So the second letter of the secret word is R.
   - E is present but not in position 1 (since we got - for E at position 1).
   - T is present but not in position 5 (since we got - for T at position 5).
   - U and P are absent.

Therefore, we now know:
- The second letter is R (fixed).
- The word contains E and T (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- The word does not contain: A, I, S, U, P.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not in position 5, and from the second guess, E is not in position 1. So E must be in position 3 or 4.

Similarly, T is present but not in position 5 (from second guess). We don't know about other positions for T.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the letters in the word: R (at position 2), E, T, and two more letters that are not A, I, S, U, P.

We also know the word does not contain the absent letters: A, I, S, U, P.

We have to find a word that fits:
- Position 2: R
- Contains E (must be in position 3 or 4)
- Contains T (not in position 5, so in 1, 3, or 4? But note: position 3 and 4 might be taken by E or T, or others)

But E must be in 3 or 4, so T cannot be in the same position as E. So T can be in position 1, 3, or 4? But if E is in 3, T can be in 1 or 4, and vice versa.

Also, we have two more letters to find.

Let's list the known absent letters: A, I, S, U, P.

We have tested: R, A, I, S, E, U, P, T.

So remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that:
- Second letter is R
- Contains E and T
- Does not contain A, I, S, U, P
- E must be in position 3 or 4
- T must not be in position 5 (so in 1, 3, or 4, but if in 3 or 4, it must be the other one from E)

We can try to form such words.

Possible positions:

Case 1: E in position 3
Then the word is: _ R E _ _
T must be in position 1 or 4 (since not 5, and 3 is taken by E).
Also, we need one more letter for position 4 if T is in 1, or for position 1 if T is in 4, and then position 5.

Case 2: E in position 4
Then the word is: _ R _ E _
T must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 5, and 4 is taken by E).

We can list possible words.

First, let's consider case 1: E in position 3 -> _ R E _ _

Subcase 1a: T in position 1 -> T R E _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, not A,I,S,U,P, and must be valid English word.

Possible words: 
- treed? But has E at 4? T R E E D -> but we have two E's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""treed"" has E at 3 and 4. But we know E is present, but we don't know if it appears twice. But in the first guess, we had only one E and it was marked present, so it could be that the word has only one E? Not necessarily, because if the word has two E's, the feedback for ""raise"" would still show E as present (but not at position 5). Similarly, in ""erupt"", we had E at 1 and it was present but wrong position, but if the word has two E's, that's fine.

But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities.

However, we are trying to guess, so we can include duplicates if necessary.

But let's see if there are words without duplicates.

""tread"" -> but has A, which is absent. Not allowed.

""trek"" -> only 4 letters? No, 5-letter: ""treks"" but has S, absent. Not allowed.

""trench"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""trend"" -> T R E N D -> N and D are new, and no A,I,S,U,P. This is a valid word.

""tress"" -> has S, not allowed.

""trest"" -> not a common word, and has two T's? T R E S T -> but S is absent. Not allowed.

So ""trend"" is a candidate: T R E N D.

But we have E in position 3, which is allowed.

Now, subcase 1b: T in position 4 -> _ R E T _
So the word is ? R E T ?

We need first and last letter, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words: 
- ""greta"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""crest"" -> has S, not allowed.
- ""frets"" -> has S, not allowed.
- ""treat"" -> has A and T at the beginning? T R E A T -> but A is absent, and also T at position 1 and 4? But we are looking for T at position 4, so first letter cannot be T? In this subcase, T is at 4, so first letter is not T. The word is ? R E T ?

""brett"" -> B R E T T -> two T's, and last letter T? But we have T at position 4 and 5? But we know T is not in position 5 (from feedback of ""erupt"": T at position 5 was marked - meaning present but wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5). Therefore, T cannot be at position 5. So ""brett"" has T at 5, which is invalid.

""dregs"" -> D R E G S -> has S, not allowed.

""wrest"" -> W R E S T -> has S, not allowed.

""prexy"" -> not common, but P is absent? P is absent, so not allowed.

It seems hard to find a word for this subcase.

Now, case 2: E in position 4 -> _ R _ E _

Subcase 2a: T in position 1 -> T R _ E _
We need a letter for position 3 and 5, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words:
- ""trode"" -> T R O D E -> E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 (from first guess: E was at 5 and was wrong). So E at 5 is invalid. But in ""trode"", E is at 5? So not allowed.

""trice"" -> has I, not allowed.

""trite"" -> has I, not allowed.

""truce"" -> has U, not allowed.

""trope"" -> has P, not allowed.

""trone"" -> T R O N E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""trume"" -> not a word.

""twere"" -> T W E R E -> but E at 3 and 5? Position 5 E is not allowed, and also R is at position 4? But we have R at position 2 fixed. ""twere"" is T W E R E -> positions: 1:T, 2:W, 3:E, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need position 2 to be R, but here it's W. So not.

We need position 2 to be R, so it must be T R ? E ?

But E at 5 is forbidden, so the last letter cannot be E.

So words like ""tribe"" has I and E at 5? Not allowed.

Hard to find.

Subcase 2b: T in position 3 -> _ R T E _
So the word is ? R T E ?

We need first and last letter, not A,I,S,U,P.

Possible words:
- ""crate"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""write"" -> has I, not allowed.
- ""grate"" -> has A, not allowed.
- ""brute"" -> has U, not allowed.
- ""trite"" -> has I, not allowed.
- ""deter"" -> D E T E R -> but E at position 2? We have position 2 fixed as R, so it must be ? R T E ? so first letter and last letter.

""deter"" is D E T E R -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need position 2 to be R, but it's E. So not.

We need the form: [letter] R T E [letter]

Examples: 
- ""brute"" -> B R U T E -> but U is absent, and E at 5? Also, T is at 4? We have T at position 3? In ""brute"": 1:B, 2:R, 3:U, 4:T, 5:E -> but we need T at position 3, but here it's at 4. So not.

We need T at position 3: so ? R T E ?

""artel"" -> has A, not allowed.

""irtel"" -> not a word, and has I.

""orten"" -> not common, but O R T E N -> O at 1, N at 5. No A,I,S,U,P. This might be a word? Orten is not standard. 

""brent"" -> B R E N T -> but E is at position 3? We are in case 2, so E should be at position 4. In ""brent"": 1:B, 2:R, 3:E, 4:N, 5:T -> so E is at 3, not 4. So not.

We need E at position 4: so the word is ? R ? E ? and we are putting T at position 3: so ? R T E ?

So the fourth letter is E, and third is T.

So words: 
- ""acted"" -> but A, and not starting with ? R.

We need the second letter R and third T, fourth E.

So: [letter] R T E [letter]

With the last letter not E (since E not at 5) and not T (since T not at 5, from feedback).

Also, the first letter not R (we know R is at 2, so first cannot be R? Actually, R could be elsewhere? But we have R at position 2, so if first is R, then we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

But let's see: if the word has two R's, then in the first guess, R was marked present (but wrong position) and in the second guess, R at position 2 was correct. So if there is another R, it might be in another position. But we don't have information about that.

However, for now, let's assume no duplicates to keep it simple, but we should not rule out.

But in this case, for the word pattern ? R T E ?, the first letter cannot be R because then we have R at 1 and 2, which is possible but let's see if there are words.

""rrted"" not a word.

So probably first letter is not R.

Now, possible words: 
- ""orte"" is not 5 letters.

""route"" -> R O U T E -> but U is absent, and E at 5? Not.

""write"" -> W R I T E -> has I, and E at 5? Not.

""crete"" -> C R E T E -> E at 3 and 5? But E at 5 not allowed, and T at 4? We need T at 3, but here T at 4. Not.

""trite"" -> T R I T E -> has I, and E at 5? Not.

It seems difficult.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another idea: what about ""trench"" but too long.

Back to case 1: we had ""trend"" as a candidate: T R E N D.

In ""trend"":
- T at position 1: we don't know if T can be at 1? We have no feedback against T at 1.
- R at position 2: correct (we know it must be R, and it is)
- E at position 3: we know E must be in 3 or 4, so 3 is allowed.
- N at position 4: new letter.
- D at position 5: new letter.

Also, no A,I,S,U,P.

And T is present and not at 5, which is satisfied.

Now, is there another candidate?

What about E in position 4? We had trouble finding words.

Another word for case 2: E in position 4 and T in position 1: T R ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5, and position 5 cannot be E.

For example, ""trode"" has E at 5, not allowed.

""trice"" has I.

But what about ""trike""? Has I? T R I K E -> has I and E at 5? Not allowed.

""trace"" has A and E at 5? Not.

""trope"" has P? Not.

""truce"" has U? Not.

So no.

With T in position 3: ? R T E ?

For example, ""brite"" -> B R I T E -> has I and E at 5? Not.

""crate"" has A.

""grate"" has A.

""wrote"" -> W R O T E -> but T at position 4? We need T at position 3, but here T at 4. And E at 5? Not.

We need T at 3: so the word must have ... R T E ...

Like ""artist"" but has A, S, and 5 letters? ""artist"" is 6? A R T I S T -> 6 letters? No, 5: A R T I S -> but has A, I, S.

Not.

""dirty"" -> D I R T Y -> has I, and R at position 2? D I R T Y -> position 2 is I, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

So it must be [consonant] R T E [consonant]

But English words like that are rare.

""forte"" -> F O R T E -> but R at position 3? We need R at 2. F O R T E -> 1:F, 2:O, 3:R, 4:T, 5:E -> not R at 2.

So not.

Therefore, the most plausible candidate from case 1 is ""trend"".

But we have another possibility: E in position 3 and T in position 4? We tried and found no good word, but let's list again.

_ R E T _

With last letter not E, not T (since T not at 5), and not A,I,S,U,P.

So last letter must be one of B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we need a word: e.g., ""tret"" is not 5 letters.

""greta"" has A.

Perhaps ""brett"" but T at 5 not allowed.

""crete"" has E at 5? C R E T E -> 5 letters? C R E T E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:T, 5:E -> but E at 5 not allowed, and also duplicate E.

Not.

So no.

Therefore, ""trend"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to consider that T might be in position 3 or 4 if E is in the other.

In ""trend"", T is at 1, E at 3.

We also have the possibility that E is at 4 and T at 1, but we couldn't find a word.

Another word: what about ""freed""? But has E at 1 and 2? F R E E D -> but position 2 is R, so F R E E D -> E at 3 and 4? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so that's possible. But we have two E's? And T is not in the word? But we know T is present, so ""freed"" does not have T. So not.

Similarly, ""green"" has no T.

We must have T.

Another candidate: ""tried"" but has I.

Not.

""trees"" has S and E at 5? Not.

So ""trend"" seems the best.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if ""trend"" is the word.

But we don't know, we are guessing.

We can also consider other words with E in position 4 and T in position 3.

For example, ""wryte"" not a word.

""cried"" has I.

Perhaps we missed ""deter"", but position 2 is E, not R.

Another idea: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, ""beret"" -> B E R E T -> but position 2 is E, not R. We need position 2 to be R.

""merry"" -> M E R R Y -> position 2 is E, not R.

Not.

So I think ""trend"" is a good guess.

But we have to make sure that T at position 1 is possible. We have no feedback against T at 1.

Similarly, in ""trend"", we have N and D which are new.

We could guess ""trench"" but it's 6 letters.

No.

Another word: ""trent"" -> T R E N T -> but T at position 1 and 5? But we know T is not at position 5 (from feedback: T at 5 was marked - meaning present but wrong position, so T cannot be at 5). Therefore, ""trent"" has T at 5, which is invalid.

So not.

Therefore, ""trend"" is valid.

We could also consider ""brent"", but in ""brent"": B R E N T -> E at position 3, which is case 1 with T at 5? But T at 5 is not allowed. So ""brent"" has T at 5, invalid.

Similarly, ""rents"" has S.

So ""trend"" seems the only common word.

Another possibility: what about E in position 4 and T in position 1? We need a word T R ? E ? with ? not E and not A,I,S,U,P.

For example, ""trode"" not allowed because E at 5.

""trone"" E at 5.

""troke"" not common, and E? T R O K E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""trine"" has I and E at 5? Not.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""trend"" is the best guess.

But let's see if there is a word with E in position 4 and T in position 3.

For example, ""wrote"" has T at 4, not 3.

""rite"" is 4 letters.

""arter"" has A and R at 5? A R T E R -> but A absent, and R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 2 fixed, so if R at 5, that's another R. But A is absent.

Not.

So I think we should go with ""trend"".

But we have another candidate: from the second guess feedback, we know R is at position 2, E is present but not at 1, T is present but not at 5.

We also know the word must have exactly 5 letters.

Another word: ""crepe"" has C R E P E -> but P is absent, and E at 5? Not.

""dregs"" has S.

So ""trend"" is good.

Perhaps ""greed"" but no T and E at 5? Not.

Therefore, I choose ""trend"" as the third guess.

But note: we are not sure if E is in position 3 or 4, but in ""trend"" we are testing E in position 3.

If it's wrong, we will know E must be in position 4, and then we can adjust.

Similarly, we are testing T in position 1.

So it's a good test.

Thus, the third guess is ""trend"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R (present, wrong position), A (absent), I (absent), S (absent), E (present, wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - The word contains R and E, but R is not in position 1, and E is not in position 5.  
  - A, I, and S are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""erupt""** → E (present, wrong position), R (correct position), U (absent), P (absent), T (present, wrong position).  
  This means:  
  - R is confirmed in position 2 (so the word has the form `_ R _ _ _`).  
  - E is present but not in position 1 (since it was marked wrong in position 1).  
  - T is present but not in position 5 (since it was marked wrong in position 5).  
  - U and P are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - R is in position 2.  
  - E and T are present but not in positions 1 or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: A, I, S, U, P (cannot appear in the word).  
- **E's position**: Since E cannot be in position 1 (from ""erupt"") or 5 (from ""raise""), it must be in position 3 or 4.  
- **T's position**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ""erupt""), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4. However, if E is in position 3, T cannot also be in position 3 (unless duplicated, but no evidence of duplicates yet), so T would be in 1 or 4. If E is in position 4, T would be in 1 or 3.  
- **Untested letters**: We need to test new common consonants (e.g., D, N, L, M) to gather more information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that fits the constraints:  
  - Position 2 must be R.  
  - Includes E and T.  
  - E in position 3 or 4 (testing position 3 in this guess).  
  - T in a new position (testing position 1).  
  - Avoids absent letters (A, I, S, U, P).  
- ""trend"" is a strong candidate:  
  - `T R E N D` → Tests T in position 1 (new position for T), E in position 3 (plausible for E), and introduces new common letters (N and D).  
  - If correct, it solves the word. If not, the feedback will clarify E and T positions and test N/D.",Guess 3: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) N(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
