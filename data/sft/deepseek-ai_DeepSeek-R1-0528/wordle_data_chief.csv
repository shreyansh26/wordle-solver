We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
It's often recommended to use words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants, and avoid repeating letters.
Common starting words in games like Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

After evaluating, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E (including two vowels A and E, and three common consonants).

So my first guess is ""CRANE"".

I am making the first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a starting word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. An ideal starting word:
- Contains common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct positions or existing letters.
- Builds around frequently used vowels and consonants in English.
- Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters with one guess.

Based on Wordle strategy, words like ""CRANE"" are effective because they include:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- All unique letters, covering 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, I will start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).
2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.
4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.
5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.
- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it's wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).

Given the constraints:
- First letter: C
- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that's C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid R, A, N.

Additionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with C.
- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Does not contain R, A, N.

We also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

Possible positions for E:
- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

We can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as 'wrong position' meaning it's present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it's -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.

Therefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that's C). So only positions 2,3,4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.

We need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.

Let's think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn't at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn't say it cannot be at positions that we didn't guess. But note: we only know it's not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We don't know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.

But we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.

Let's list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:

Avoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.

Common words starting with C and containing E:

- Words without A, R, N: 
Possible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.

But what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

Vowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.
Consonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.

We want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.

Idea: Place E at position 2? But let's not fix its position? We need to find the position.

Alternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it's there.

Example words:
- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:
Common words: 
  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.
- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). 
- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don't know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.

But we don't know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.

Another: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn't be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got '-' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn't be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it's still marked '-', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that's already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes 'x' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect '-'? Because it's still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It's wiser.

Therefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.

But note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that's taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.

Therefore, in our next guess, we must have:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don't know? But guessing a word with two E's might be possible? But let's avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That's better.

So let us choose a word that:
- Starts with C
- Does not contain R, A, N
- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don't know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E's position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else '-' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let's choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let's choose position 3? Or position 2?

Alternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:

Case: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get '-' or 'x'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:

  ✓: then we know E is at position2.

  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it's at position3 or 4? 

  x: won't happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get 'x'; at worst we get '-'

Similarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.

So we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down? Moreover:

We haven't tested positions 2,3,4? So placing E at a particular position will tell us about that position?

But we might also guess a word that doesn't commit to E's position? Impossible? Wait: we must contain E? And we have positions 2,3,4 to place? So we have to choose one? 

To maximize information: we can choose a word that uses E but also many new letters? Without R,A,N.

So let me try:

Common words: 
- ""CHOSE"": but E at the end? But if we put E at position5, we know it's not correct? But if we put E at position4? How? ""CHOSE"" is positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=O, 4=S, 5=E -> E at 5? We shouldn't put E at5? We know E is not at5? So that's not useful? If we guess ""CHOSE"", we put E at5 -> we will get '-' again? Because same as above? Also, then we don't test E at position4? So that's inefficient.

Therefore, choose a word that has E in position2,3, or4? And new letters? And avoid A,R,N.

Possible words:

Position2: E -> then we can have C E ? ? ? 
  Options: ""CELEB"" (not common), ""CEILI"" (not common), ""CEDES"", ""CEILS"" etc.
But also: ""CELLO"" -> C-E-L-L-O -> but two L's? We don't test many new? But letter L is repeated? Not ideal? 

Position3: C ? E ? ? 
  Options: ""CUED"" is 4? ""CUES"" is 4? 
  5 letters: ""CHOSE"" -> but E at5? Not in middle?
  ""BLEEP"" doesn't start with C?
  ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T -> E at4? But that's allowed? Because E is at position4? And then T at position5? 

But does ""COMET"" avoid A,R,N? Yes: O,M,E,T -> no A,R,N? So that's OK.

Position4: C ? ? E ? 
  Example: ""COSTE"" -> but we have T and E? But we don't know? Words: ""CLINE"", ""CUTES"", etc.

But let's think about maximizing new letters:

Using ""COMET"": 
- C: known at position1? So if we guess ""COMET"":
  Position1: C -> ✓ (unless the word has C at start? We know it does? So ✓)
  Position2: O -> it may be ✓ or '-' or 'x'
  Position3: M -> same
  Position4: E -> we expect '-' or ✓? But we know E is in the word at positions 2,3,4? So if we put E at4, it could be ✓ (if E is at4) or '-' (if E is at2 or3)
  Position5: T -> it will be 'x', '-' or '✓'?

But we are introducing O, M, T? That's three new letters? Plus E? Actually, E we already know? But T is new? And O and M are also new? So that's good? Also no duplicate letters? And all 5 distinct: C,O,M,E,T.

But what if we try ""CELLO"": has two L's so only tests C,E,L,O? That's less efficient.

Another candidate: ""CHOSE""? But we must avoid putting E at5? And at position5 we already know E is not? So let's not? Then why not ""CHOSE""? Because ""CHOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is not the position? So we would get the same feedback for E? '-', but then for other letters? We can see? Actually, but position5 is E? Then we know feedback? We already know E is not at5? So guessing E at5 again doesn't help? So it's wasting the position5? We can use position5 for another letter? And put E elsewhere.

So ""COMET"" looks good? Let me check if it is a valid word? Yes? And it's 5-letter? Yes.

But wait: what about ""CLEAR""? Has A? But we must avoid A? So not.

What about ""CUPID""? But has I and D? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? So we cannot skip E.

So we must include E? Therefore, choose a word that starts with C, includes E, doesn't have A,R,N? and preferably unique letters? And avoid placing E at5? 

So ""COMET"": 
- C (position1)
- O (position2): new letter? Then M (position3)? Then E (position4)? Then T (position5)?

But we avoid E at5? So E is at4? We want to place E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position5? So now position4? So that's good? And we test three letters: O, M, T.

Alternatively, we could place E at2? Then we need letters? For example: ""CEILS""? 
""CEILS"": C-E-I-L-S? Avoids A,R,N? And letters? E is at2? Then I at3? L at4? S at5? That is good? But then we test I, L, S.

Which one is better? It depends? Both are valid? Let's see frequent letters? T is common? S is common? 

Another candidate: ""COPSE""? But that's C-O-P-S-E -> again E at5? So avoid? 

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E -> E at5? Avoid? None? 

""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:

Position2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That's good? 

So ""CELTS"": 
- Position1: C -> ✓
- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.

Also, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? 

""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? 

Which one? Compare:

With ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else '-' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? 

With ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? 

Which letter is more common? T, S? Both common? 

But note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was '-'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? 

We might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? 

But similarly? 

I think both are OK? But let me see? 

Idea: Since we don't have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: 
Problem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? 

But also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn't have? So it's valid? 

But ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? 

But its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? 

Now? Which one? 

I think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? 

But also common letters? 

Actually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? 

But wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? 

Perhaps try covering more vowels? We haven't tested I,O,U? 

""COMET"" has O? 

""CHEST"" has E? 

But O is a vowel? 

So ""COMET"": O and M,T? 

But O is a vowel? Then why not?

Since E is present? Then let's not worry about vowels? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? 

So? We must include E? 

So choose one? 

I recall that a common second word? But situation is? 

Let me choose ""COMET"" because:

First guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? 

Thus? We will get:

Feedback: 
Position1: C is ✓
Position2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or '-' or 'x')
Position3: M -> ?
Position4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or '-'
Position5: T -> ?

But we also are introducing O,M? T? 

Alternatively? 

If we choose a word that doesn't contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? 

Therefore? Let's go with ""COMET""? 

But wait? What if? 

I think ""COMET"" is good? 

Another idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? 

For example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can't? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? 

Similarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? 

So ""COMET"" seems optimal? 

But? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? 

""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? 

Therefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?

Both are acceptable? 

I'll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? 

So guess: ""COMET""

But wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? '-'? Etc? 

It's fine? 

Therefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).

For the second guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).
- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.
- It must exclude R, A, and N.
- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.

""COMET"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).
- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).

<guess>comet</guess>",comet,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).
2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.
4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.
5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.
- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it's wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).

Given the constraints:
- First letter: C
- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that's C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid R, A, N.

Additionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with C.
- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Does not contain R, A, N.

We also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

Possible positions for E:
- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

We can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as 'wrong position' meaning it's present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it's -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.

Therefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that's C). So only positions 2,3,4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.

We need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.

Let's think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn't at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn't say it cannot be at positions that we didn't guess. But note: we only know it's not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We don't know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.

But we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.

Let's list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:

Avoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.

Common words starting with C and containing E:

- Words without A, R, N: 
Possible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.

But what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

Vowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.
Consonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.

We want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.

Idea: Place E at position 2? But let's not fix its position? We need to find the position.

Alternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it's there.

Example words:
- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:
Common words: 
  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.
- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). 
- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don't know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.

But we don't know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.

Another: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn't be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got '-' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn't be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it's still marked '-', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that's already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes 'x' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect '-'? Because it's still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It's wiser.

Therefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.

But note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that's taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.

Therefore, in our next guess, we must have:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don't know? But guessing a word with two E's might be possible? But let's avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That's better.

So let us choose a word that:
- Starts with C
- Does not contain R, A, N
- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don't know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E's position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else '-' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let's choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let's choose position 3? Or position 2?

Alternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:

Case: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get '-' or 'x'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:

  ✓: then we know E is at position2.

  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it's at position3 or 4? 

  x: won't happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get 'x'; at worst we get '-'

Similarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.

So we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down? Moreover:

We haven't tested positions 2,3,4? So placing E at a particular position will tell us about that position?

But we might also guess a word that doesn't commit to E's position? Impossible? Wait: we must contain E? And we have positions 2,3,4 to place? So we have to choose one? 

To maximize information: we can choose a word that uses E but also many new letters? Without R,A,N.

So let me try:

Common words: 
- ""CHOSE"": but E at the end? But if we put E at position5, we know it's not correct? But if we put E at position4? How? ""CHOSE"" is positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=O, 4=S, 5=E -> E at 5? We shouldn't put E at5? We know E is not at5? So that's not useful? If we guess ""CHOSE"", we put E at5 -> we will get '-' again? Because same as above? Also, then we don't test E at position4? So that's inefficient.

Therefore, choose a word that has E in position2,3, or4? And new letters? And avoid A,R,N.

Possible words:

Position2: E -> then we can have C E ? ? ? 
  Options: ""CELEB"" (not common), ""CEILI"" (not common), ""CEDES"", ""CEILS"" etc.
But also: ""CELLO"" -> C-E-L-L-O -> but two L's? We don't test many new? But letter L is repeated? Not ideal? 

Position3: C ? E ? ? 
  Options: ""CUED"" is 4? ""CUES"" is 4? 
  5 letters: ""CHOSE"" -> but E at5? Not in middle?
  ""BLEEP"" doesn't start with C?
  ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T -> E at4? But that's allowed? Because E is at position4? And then T at position5? 

But does ""COMET"" avoid A,R,N? Yes: O,M,E,T -> no A,R,N? So that's OK.

Position4: C ? ? E ? 
  Example: ""COSTE"" -> but we have T and E? But we don't know? Words: ""CLINE"", ""CUTES"", etc.

But let's think about maximizing new letters:

Using ""COMET"": 
- C: known at position1? So if we guess ""COMET"":
  Position1: C -> ✓ (unless the word has C at start? We know it does? So ✓)
  Position2: O -> it may be ✓ or '-' or 'x'
  Position3: M -> same
  Position4: E -> we expect '-' or ✓? But we know E is in the word at positions 2,3,4? So if we put E at4, it could be ✓ (if E is at4) or '-' (if E is at2 or3)
  Position5: T -> it will be 'x', '-' or '✓'?

But we are introducing O, M, T? That's three new letters? Plus E? Actually, E we already know? But T is new? And O and M are also new? So that's good? Also no duplicate letters? And all 5 distinct: C,O,M,E,T.

But what if we try ""CELLO"": has two L's so only tests C,E,L,O? That's less efficient.

Another candidate: ""CHOSE""? But we must avoid putting E at5? And at position5 we already know E is not? So let's not? Then why not ""CHOSE""? Because ""CHOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is not the position? So we would get the same feedback for E? '-', but then for other letters? We can see? Actually, but position5 is E? Then we know feedback? We already know E is not at5? So guessing E at5 again doesn't help? So it's wasting the position5? We can use position5 for another letter? And put E elsewhere.

So ""COMET"" looks good? Let me check if it is a valid word? Yes? And it's 5-letter? Yes.

But wait: what about ""CLEAR""? Has A? But we must avoid A? So not.

What about ""CUPID""? But has I and D? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? So we cannot skip E.

So we must include E? Therefore, choose a word that starts with C, includes E, doesn't have A,R,N? and preferably unique letters? And avoid placing E at5? 

So ""COMET"": 
- C (position1)
- O (position2): new letter? Then M (position3)? Then E (position4)? Then T (position5)?

But we avoid E at5? So E is at4? We want to place E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position5? So now position4? So that's good? And we test three letters: O, M, T.

Alternatively, we could place E at2? Then we need letters? For example: ""CEILS""? 
""CEILS"": C-E-I-L-S? Avoids A,R,N? And letters? E is at2? Then I at3? L at4? S at5? That is good? But then we test I, L, S.

Which one is better? It depends? Both are valid? Let's see frequent letters? T is common? S is common? 

Another candidate: ""COPSE""? But that's C-O-P-S-E -> again E at5? So avoid? 

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E -> E at5? Avoid? None? 

""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:

Position2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That's good? 

So ""CELTS"": 
- Position1: C -> ✓
- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.

Also, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? 

""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? 

Which one? Compare:

With ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else '-' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? 

With ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? 

Which letter is more common? T, S? Both common? 

But note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was '-'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? 

We might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? 

But similarly? 

I think both are OK? But let me see? 

Idea: Since we don't have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: 
Problem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? 

But also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn't have? So it's valid? 

But ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? 

But its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? 

Now? Which one? 

I think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? 

But also common letters? 

Actually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? 

But wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? 

Perhaps try covering more vowels? We haven't tested I,O,U? 

""COMET"" has O? 

""CHEST"" has E? 

But O is a vowel? 

So ""COMET"": O and M,T? 

But O is a vowel? Then why not?

Since E is present? Then let's not worry about vowels? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? 

So? We must include E? 

So choose one? 

I recall that a common second word? But situation is? 

Let me choose ""COMET"" because:

First guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? 

Thus? We will get:

Feedback: 
Position1: C is ✓
Position2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or '-' or 'x')
Position3: M -> ?
Position4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or '-'
Position5: T -> ?

But we also are introducing O,M? T? 

Alternatively? 

If we choose a word that doesn't contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? 

Therefore? Let's go with ""COMET""? 

But wait? What if? 

I think ""COMET"" is good? 

Another idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? 

For example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can't? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? 

Similarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? 

So ""COMET"" seems optimal? 

But? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? 

""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? 

Therefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?

Both are acceptable? 

I'll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? 

So guess: ""COMET""

But wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? '-'? Etc? 

It's fine? 

Therefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).

For the second guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).
- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.
- It must exclude R, A, and N.
- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.

""COMET"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).
- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).",Guess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(✓) T(x),FAIL

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
It's often recommended to use words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants, and avoid repeating letters.
Common starting words in games like Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

After evaluating, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E (including two vowels A and E, and three common consonants).

So my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Format the response as required.I am making the first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a starting word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. An ideal starting word:
- Contains common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct positions or existing letters.
- Builds around frequently used vowels and consonants in English.
- Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters with one guess.

Based on Wordle strategy, words like ""CRANE"" are effective because they include:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- All unique letters, covering 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, I will start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).
2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.
4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.
5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.
- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it's wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).

Given the constraints:
- First letter: C
- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that's C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid R, A, N.

Additionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with C.
- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Does not contain R, A, N.

We also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

Possible positions for E:
- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

We can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as 'wrong position' meaning it's present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it's -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.

Therefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that's C). So only positions 2,3,4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.

We need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.

Let's think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn't at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn't say it cannot be at positions that we didn't guess. But note: we only know it's not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We don't know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.

But we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.

Let's list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:

Avoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.

Common words starting with C and containing E:

- Words without A, R, N: 
Possible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.

But what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

Vowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.
Consonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.

We want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.

Idea: Place E at position 2? But let's not fix its position? We need to find the position.

Alternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it's there.

Example words:
- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:
Common words: 
  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.
- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). 
- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don't know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.

But we don't know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.

Another: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn't be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got '-' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn't be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it's still marked '-', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that's already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes 'x' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect '-'? Because it's still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It's wiser.

Therefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.

But note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that's taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.

Therefore, in our next guess, we must have:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don't know? But guessing a word with two E's might be possible? But let's avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That's better.

So let us choose a word that:
- Starts with C
- Does not contain R, A, N
- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don't know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E's position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else '-' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let's choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let's choose position 3? Or position 2?

Alternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:

Case: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get '-' or 'x'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:

  ✓: then we know E is at position2.

  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it's at position3 or 4? 

  x: won't happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get 'x'; at worst we get '-'

Similarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.

So we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down? Moreover:

We haven't tested positions 2,3,4? So placing E at a particular position will tell us about that position?

But we might also guess a word that doesn't commit to E's position? Impossible? Wait: we must contain E? And we have positions 2,3,4 to place? So we have to choose one? 

To maximize information: we can choose a word that uses E but also many new letters? Without R,A,N.

So let me try:

Common words: 
- ""CHOSE"": but E at the end? But if we put E at position5, we know it's not correct? But if we put E at position4? How? ""CHOSE"" is positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=O, 4=S, 5=E -> E at 5? We shouldn't put E at5? We know E is not at5? So that's not useful? If we guess ""CHOSE"", we put E at5 -> we will get '-' again? Because same as above? Also, then we don't test E at position4? So that's inefficient.

Therefore, choose a word that has E in position2,3, or4? And new letters? And avoid A,R,N.

Possible words:

Position2: E -> then we can have C E ? ? ? 
  Options: ""CELEB"" (not common), ""CEILI"" (not common), ""CEDES"", ""CEILS"" etc.
But also: ""CELLO"" -> C-E-L-L-O -> but two L's? We don't test many new? But letter L is repeated? Not ideal? 

Position3: C ? E ? ? 
  Options: ""CUED"" is 4? ""CUES"" is 4? 
  5 letters: ""CHOSE"" -> but E at5? Not in middle?
  ""BLEEP"" doesn't start with C?
  ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T -> E at4? But that's allowed? Because E is at position4? And then T at position5? 

But does ""COMET"" avoid A,R,N? Yes: O,M,E,T -> no A,R,N? So that's OK.

Position4: C ? ? E ? 
  Example: ""COSTE"" -> but we have T and E? But we don't know? Words: ""CLINE"", ""CUTES"", etc.

But let's think about maximizing new letters:

Using ""COMET"": 
- C: known at position1? So if we guess ""COMET"":
  Position1: C -> ✓ (unless the word has C at start? We know it does? So ✓)
  Position2: O -> it may be ✓ or '-' or 'x'
  Position3: M -> same
  Position4: E -> we expect '-' or ✓? But we know E is in the word at positions 2,3,4? So if we put E at4, it could be ✓ (if E is at4) or '-' (if E is at2 or3)
  Position5: T -> it will be 'x', '-' or '✓'?

But we are introducing O, M, T? That's three new letters? Plus E? Actually, E we already know? But T is new? And O and M are also new? So that's good? Also no duplicate letters? And all 5 distinct: C,O,M,E,T.

But what if we try ""CELLO"": has two L's so only tests C,E,L,O? That's less efficient.

Another candidate: ""CHOSE""? But we must avoid putting E at5? And at position5 we already know E is not? So let's not? Then why not ""CHOSE""? Because ""CHOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is not the position? So we would get the same feedback for E? '-', but then for other letters? We can see? Actually, but position5 is E? Then we know feedback? We already know E is not at5? So guessing E at5 again doesn't help? So it's wasting the position5? We can use position5 for another letter? And put E elsewhere.

So ""COMET"" looks good? Let me check if it is a valid word? Yes? And it's 5-letter? Yes.

But wait: what about ""CLEAR""? Has A? But we must avoid A? So not.

What about ""CUPID""? But has I and D? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? So we cannot skip E.

So we must include E? Therefore, choose a word that starts with C, includes E, doesn't have A,R,N? and preferably unique letters? And avoid placing E at5? 

So ""COMET"": 
- C (position1)
- O (position2): new letter? Then M (position3)? Then E (position4)? Then T (position5)?

But we avoid E at5? So E is at4? We want to place E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position5? So now position4? So that's good? And we test three letters: O, M, T.

Alternatively, we could place E at2? Then we need letters? For example: ""CEILS""? 
""CEILS"": C-E-I-L-S? Avoids A,R,N? And letters? E is at2? Then I at3? L at4? S at5? That is good? But then we test I, L, S.

Which one is better? It depends? Both are valid? Let's see frequent letters? T is common? S is common? 

Another candidate: ""COPSE""? But that's C-O-P-S-E -> again E at5? So avoid? 

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E -> E at5? Avoid? None? 

""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:

Position2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That's good? 

So ""CELTS"": 
- Position1: C -> ✓
- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.

Also, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? 

""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? 

Which one? Compare:

With ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else '-' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? 

With ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? 

Which letter is more common? T, S? Both common? 

But note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was '-'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? 

We might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? 

But similarly? 

I think both are OK? But let me see? 

Idea: Since we don't have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: 
Problem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? 

But also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn't have? So it's valid? 

But ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? 

But its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? 

Now? Which one? 

I think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? 

But also common letters? 

Actually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? 

But wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? 

Perhaps try covering more vowels? We haven't tested I,O,U? 

""COMET"" has O? 

""CHEST"" has E? 

But O is a vowel? 

So ""COMET"": O and M,T? 

But O is a vowel? Then why not?

Since E is present? Then let's not worry about vowels? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? 

So? We must include E? 

So choose one? 

I recall that a common second word? But situation is? 

Let me choose ""COMET"" because:

First guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? 

Thus? We will get:

Feedback: 
Position1: C is ✓
Position2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or '-' or 'x')
Position3: M -> ?
Position4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or '-'
Position5: T -> ?

But we also are introducing O,M? T? 

Alternatively? 

If we choose a word that doesn't contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? 

Therefore? Let's go with ""COMET""? 

But wait? What if? 

I think ""COMET"" is good? 

Another idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? 

For example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can't? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? 

Similarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? 

So ""COMET"" seems optimal? 

But? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? 

""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? 

Therefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?

Both are acceptable? 

I'll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? 

So guess: ""COMET""

But wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? '-'? Etc? 

It's fine? 

Therefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).

For the second guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).
- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.
- It must exclude R, A, and N.
- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.

""COMET"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).
- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).

The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).\n2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.\n3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.\n4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.\n5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word starts with \'C\'.\n- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.\n- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it\'s wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- First letter: C\n- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that\'s C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- We must avoid R, A, N.\n\nAdditionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:\n- Begins with C.\n- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n- Does not contain R, A, N.\n\nWe also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as \'wrong position\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it\'s -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.\n\nTherefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that\'s C). So only positions 2,3,4.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.\n\nWe need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn\'t at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn\'t say it cannot be at positions that we didn\'t guess. But note: we only know it\'s not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don\'t know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nWe don\'t know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.\n\nBut we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.\n\nLet\'s list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:\n\nAvoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.\n\nCommon words starting with C and containing E:\n\n- Words without A, R, N: \nPossible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.\n\nBut what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.\n\nVowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.\nConsonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.\n\nWe want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.\n\nIdea: Place E at position 2? But let\'s not fix its position? We need to find the position.\n\nAlternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it\'s there.\n\nExample words:\n- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:\nCommon words: \n  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.\n- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). \n- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don\'t know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.\n\nBut we don\'t know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.\n\nAnother: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn\'t be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got \'-\' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn\'t be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it\'s still marked \'-\', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that\'s already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes \'x\' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect \'-\'? Because it\'s still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It\'s wiser.\n\nTherefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.\n\nBut note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that\'s taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we must have:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don\'t know? But guessing a word with two E\'s might be possible? But let\'s avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That\'s better.\n\nSo let us choose a word that:\n- Starts with C\n- Does not contain R, A, N\n- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don\'t know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E\'s position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else \'-\' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let\'s choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let\'s choose position 3? Or position 2?\n\nAlternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:\n\nCase: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get \'-\' or \'x\'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:\n\n  ✓: then we know E is at position2.\n\n  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it\'s at position3 or 4? \n\n  x: won\'t happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get \'x\'; at worst we get \'-\'\n\nSimilarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.\n\nSo we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down?

Avoid? None? \n\n""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:\n\nPosition2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That\'s good? \n\nSo ""CELTS"": \n- Position1: C -> ✓\n- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.\n\nAlso, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? \n\n""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? \n\nWhich one? Compare:\n\nWith ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else \'-\' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? \n\nWith ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? \n\nWhich letter is more common? T, S? Both common? \n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was \'-\'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? \n\nWe might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? \n\nBut similarly? \n\nI think both are OK? But let me see? \n\nIdea: Since we don\'t have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: \nProblem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? \n\nBut also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn\'t have? So it\'s valid? \n\nBut ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? \n\nBut its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? \n\nNow? Which one? \n\nI think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? \n\nBut also common letters? \n\nActually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? \n\nBut wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? \n\nPerhaps try covering more vowels? We haven\'t tested I,O,U? \n\n""COMET"" has O? \n\n""CHEST"" has E? \n\nBut O is a vowel? \n\nSo ""COMET"": O and M,T? \n\nBut O is a vowel? Then why not?\n\nSince E is present? Then let\'s not worry about vowels? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? \n\nSo? We must include E? \n\nSo choose one? \n\nI recall that a common second word? But situation is? \n\nLet me choose ""COMET"" because:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? \n\nThus? We will get:\n\nFeedback: \nPosition1: C is ✓\nPosition2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or \'-\' or \'x\')\nPosition3: M -> ?\nPosition4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or \'-\'\nPosition5: T -> ?\n\nBut we also are introducing O,M? T? \n\nAlternatively? \n\nIf we choose a word that doesn\'t contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? \n\nTherefore? Let\'s go with ""COMET""? \n\nBut wait? What if? \n\nI think ""COMET"" is good? \n\nAnother idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? \n\nFor example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can\'t? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? \n\nSimilarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? \n\nSo ""COMET"" seems optimal? \n\nBut? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? \n\n""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? \n\nTherefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?\n\nBoth are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? \n\nSo guess: ""COMET""\n\nBut wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? \'-\'? Etc? \n\nIt\'s fine? \n\nTherefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".\n- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).\n- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- It must exclude R, A, and N.\n- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.\n\n""COMET"" fits these criteria:\n- Starts with ""C"".\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).\n- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).\n\n<guess>comet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(✓): Correct and in position 1.
- R(x): Not in the word.
- A(x): Not in the word.
- N(x): Not in the word.
- E(-): In the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (""comet""):
- C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (as expected).
- O(x): Not in the word.
- M(x): Not in the word.
- E(✓): Correct and in position 4 (since we placed E there and it got ✓).
- T(x): Not in the word.

What we know now:
1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1).
2. Position 4 is ""E"" (from E(✓) in guess 2).
3. The word contains ""E"" at position 4, so the feedback from guess 1 (E(-)) must have been because E was not in position 5, but we now know it's in position 4.
4. R, A, N, O, M, T are all not in the word (excluded).

Also, since E is fixed at position 4, we can deduce:
- The word is of the form: C _ _ E _

Remaining positions: 2 and 3 and 5. We have three unknown positions.

We have excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T.

So available letters: All letters except these and those used? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. But E is included? We should not exclude E? Only the excluded ones are R, A, N, O, M, T? Also, C is known? C is in? So excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T. And we know E is in? But now we have E at position 4? 

We can also recall that in word games, we need to avoid the excluded letters? So the set of available letters: any English alphabet letter except R, A, N, O, M, T? And including E? But E is already placed? So we need to fill in positions 2,3 and 5? But E is only at position 4? So we have three positions? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We may not use E in other positions? The word might have duplicate E? But we don't know? We placed it only once? Since in ""comet"" we got E at position4? Then we know E is at position4? But we don't know about other E's? We can avoid? Or use? 

Since we don't have any clue about possibility of duplicate E, it's safer to avoid? Because not too frequent? 

Therefore: for positions 2,3,5: we must choose letters from that set? 

We have to form a valid English word? So words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" 

We also know that E must be? The word ends with E? Position4:E, position5:unknown? But it's not E? Unless double E? But we avoid? So position5? Unknown? 

How to choose? We must maximize information? We want to test multiple letters? So pick a word that uses three new letters (since we have three positions)? And avoid duplicate E? 

Possible words:

The pattern: ""C _ _ E _""

- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 5: ?

We must avoid the excluded letters: A, R, N, O, M, T? And include only other letters? 

For example, consider common letters: S, L, I, D, U, etc.? 

Possible words: 
- ""CUESE""? Not a word? Must be valid English word? 
- ""CEDES"": C E D E S? But has E twice? And D? Also? Position2: E? We know? But C at1? And position4:E? So would have two E's? But if we guess ""CEDES"", then position1:C? Position2:E? Position4:E? That could be?

But we already know E is at position4? So if we put E at position2? Then we might get feedback? And D? And S? 

But let's see? 

Also, ""CEDES"" uses E twice? And we haven't tested E at2? But we know E is present only from position4? So if E is at2? Then its occurrence? But it might be? 

But our goal is to deduce the word? So we can try? But for maximizing info? Avoid duplicates? 

Look for words without duplicates? 

For example: 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S: U at2, B at3, E at4, S at5: letters U,B,S? But avoids excluded? 

Similarly? 
- ""CHESS"": but has S twice? Avoid duplicates? 
- ""CLIPS"": C-L-I-P-S: then pattern? Position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? But it does not fit? Because pattern: position1:C, position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? -> ""CLIES""? But ""CLIES"" isn't a common word? 

What are common words fitting ""C??E?""? 

Examples:
- ""CABLE"": A is excluded? Cannot? 
- ""CEDED"": has E twice? and D? Not common? 
- ""CELLS"": has L twice? 
- ""CHIPS"": but position4:E? So ""CHI E S""? Does not match pattern? 
The word must have E at position4? 

Valid words: 
- ""CUBES"" : C-U-B-E-S 
- ""COPES"": but O is excluded? Cannot? 
- ""CIDES"": C-I-D-E-S -> ""CIDES""? Not common? 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""DICES"": doesn't start with C? 
- ""HICES"": similarly? 

Better? 
- ""CULET"": but T excluded? And not common? 
T is excluded? 

Another? ""CUZES""? Not valid? 

What about ""CLEFS""? C-L-E-F-S? But then E at position3? But we need E at position4? So pattern: positions? 1:C,2:L,3:E,4:F? But E at position3? No? So we need position4:E? So position3 must not be E? 

Therefore: we need a word: first letter C, fourth letter E, last letter something? And middle letters? 

So back to ""CUBES""? But U? Or ""CIDER"": has R? Excluded? Cannot? Or ""CIDED"": D? But ""CIDED"" has E at position4? C-I-D-E-D? That's C at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, D at5? But it has D twice? 

But also? R is excluded? So ""CIDER"" cannot? Because R? 

What about ""CHEVY""? But E at position3? Not? We need E at position4? 

Pattern: ""CXXEX"" where ""XX"" are any? 

Then: 
Word: ""CUKES""? K? 
""CUTES"": T excluded? 
""CAGES"": A excluded? 
""CAKES"": A excluded? 

It's tricky? 

Another possibility: ""BYTES"" isn't start with C? 

Perhaps ""CLEWS"": C-L-E-W-S? But E at position3? Not 4? Then if we guess? Position1:C? Then position2:L? Position3:E? But our pattern has position3 as blank? So E must be at4? 

Alternatively? Think: 
- We have ""C _ _ E _"", so letter at position3 is before E? 

Valid words: 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S -> valid? 
- ""CIDES"": not common? 
- ""CUSEC"": not common? 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""CLEEK"": E? 
""CLEEK"": C-L-E-E-K -> E at3? Not? 

Wait? How about ""CLUES""? C-L-U-E-S -> position4:E? Yes? So ""CLUES"": C at1, L at2, U at3, E at4, S at5? 

Also, ""CLUES"" uses letters? C,L,U,E,S? All distinct? And avoids excluded? 

Similarly? ""CUBES"" also valid? 

Now? Both? We choose one? 

But we must also know? What about the previous feedback? We have tested? We tested C (at1)? E (at4)? So for ""CLUES"": 
- Position1: C ✓ (known) 
- Position2: L -> new? 
- Position3: U -> new? 
- Position4: E ✓ (known) 
- Position5: S -> new? 

Similarly? ""CUBES"": U,B,S? 

Which letters are more common? L,U? vs? U,B? 

We have tested nothing? S is good? 

We might choose ""CLUES"" because it has S? Which is common? 

Or ""CUBES"" with B? 

But let's consider possible words? Also, we know the secret word? Doesn't contain E at other positions? We don't know? So guessing L at position2? And U at3? 

We can do? 

We also know that from guess1: E(-)? But we placed E at5? And it was wrong? Now we know E at4? So no issue? 

How about? We can try to include letters that reduce possibilities? 

List possible English words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" without R,A,N,O,M,T? 

Possible? 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S 
- ""CLUES"": C-L-U-E-S 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""CUZES"": not common? 
- ""CEDED"": not common? 
- ""CIDED"": C-I-D-E-D? Has D twice? And I,D? 
- ""CIGES"": not common? 
- ""CISES"": might be C-I-S-E-S? S twice? 
- ""CURES"": R excluded? 
- ""CUSES"": S twice? 
- ""CYLES"": not common? 

So likely only a few: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES"", ""CIDES"" (rare)? Probably ""CUBES"" and ""CLUES"" are common? 

We could also have words like ""CHEWY""? E at position3? No? Must E at4? 

What about ""CHEAP""? A excluded? 

Or ""CHEEK"": double E? 

But E at position3? Not? 

Therefore? Common words: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES""? 

Also? ""CAKES"": excluded? 

So? Guess either? Let's choose ""CLUES""? Because it includes L? And U? And S? 

If we guess ""CLUES"", we test L, U, S? 

If the word is ""CLUES"", we win? 

Similarly? 

But note? There is also ""CUBES""? 

So the word could be one of these? 

But we have 4 guesses left? If we guess ""CLUES"", and it's the one? Then done? Otherwise? We get feedback? 

Similarly? 

But we don't know? 

So? Step? 

We should pick one? 

Idea? We could choose a word that uses letters to differentiate? But we don't know? 

Since both ""CLUES"" and ""CUBES"" exist? We guess ""CLUES""? 

Note? There are other possibilities? Like ""CULLS""? But E missing? Must have E? Or ""CULLS"" doesn't have E? So not? 

Or ""CYST"": but not E at end? 

Only words fitting? 

Another? ""CUED"": not 5 letters? 

So? We pick ""CLUES"" as the guess? 

Therefore? we guess ""CLUES""

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: crane**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms the first letter is **C**.
     - `R(x)`, `A(x)`, `N(x)`: Letters **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word.
     - `E(-)`: **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
   
   - **Guess 2: comet**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms position 1 is still **C** (as expected).
     - `O(x)`, `M(x)`, `T(x)`: Letters **O**, **M**, and **T** are not in the word.
     - `E(✓)`: Confirms **E** is in position 4.

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Position 1**: **C** (fixed).
   - **Position 4**: **E** (fixed).
   - **Excluded letters**: **R, A, N, O, M, T** (confirmed absent).
   - **E** must appear in the word, and we now know its position (4), so it cannot be duplicated elsewhere unless necessary (but duplicates are rare; avoid for now).
   - The word format: `C _ _ E _` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown).
   - Remaining letters to explore: Consonants like **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y** and vowels like **I, U** (since **A, O** are excluded).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Focus on positions 2, 3, and 5 with new, common letters not yet tested or excluded.
   - Prioritize letters like **L, S, U, I, H** (high frequency) to maximize information.
   - Aim for a valid English word fitting `C _ _ E _` without using excluded letters.
   - Possible candidate words:
     - `CUBES`: Tests **U**, **B**, **S** (valid word, but **B** and **U** are less common).
     - `CLUES`: Tests **L**, **U**, **S** (common letters; **L** and **S** are highly frequent).
     - `CIDES`: Less common; avoid for better information.
     - `CHESS`: Invalid position (would place **E** at pos 3, not pos 4).
   - **Choosing ""CLUES""**:
     - Covers **L** (position 2), **U** (position 3), and **S** (position 5).
     - All letters are distinct and new (not excluded or previously guessed).
     - Tests frequent letters: **L**, **S**, and **U** can help narrow down possibilities significantly.
     - If correct, wins; if not, feedback positions **L**, **U**, **S** will reveal more (e.g., if **S** is absent or **U** is correct).

4. **Why not other words?**
   - `CUBES` is also valid but tests less common letters like **B** and **U**. **B** is rarer than **L** or **S**.
   - Words like `CAKES` or `CURES` include excluded letters (**A**, **R**).

Based on this, **CLUES** is the best guess to test high-frequency letters in the unknown positions.

<guess>clues</guess>",clues,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C(✓): Correct and in position 1.
- R(x): Not in the word.
- A(x): Not in the word.
- N(x): Not in the word.
- E(-): In the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (""comet""):
- C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (as expected).
- O(x): Not in the word.
- M(x): Not in the word.
- E(✓): Correct and in position 4 (since we placed E there and it got ✓).
- T(x): Not in the word.

What we know now:
1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1).
2. Position 4 is ""E"" (from E(✓) in guess 2).
3. The word contains ""E"" at position 4, so the feedback from guess 1 (E(-)) must have been because E was not in position 5, but we now know it's in position 4.
4. R, A, N, O, M, T are all not in the word (excluded).

Also, since E is fixed at position 4, we can deduce:
- The word is of the form: C _ _ E _

Remaining positions: 2 and 3 and 5. We have three unknown positions.

We have excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T.

So available letters: All letters except these and those used? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. But E is included? We should not exclude E? Only the excluded ones are R, A, N, O, M, T? Also, C is known? C is in? So excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T. And we know E is in? But now we have E at position 4? 

We can also recall that in word games, we need to avoid the excluded letters? So the set of available letters: any English alphabet letter except R, A, N, O, M, T? And including E? But E is already placed? So we need to fill in positions 2,3 and 5? But E is only at position 4? So we have three positions? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We may not use E in other positions? The word might have duplicate E? But we don't know? We placed it only once? Since in ""comet"" we got E at position4? Then we know E is at position4? But we don't know about other E's? We can avoid? Or use? 

Since we don't have any clue about possibility of duplicate E, it's safer to avoid? Because not too frequent? 

Therefore: for positions 2,3,5: we must choose letters from that set? 

We have to form a valid English word? So words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" 

We also know that E must be? The word ends with E? Position4:E, position5:unknown? But it's not E? Unless double E? But we avoid? So position5? Unknown? 

How to choose? We must maximize information? We want to test multiple letters? So pick a word that uses three new letters (since we have three positions)? And avoid duplicate E? 

Possible words:

The pattern: ""C _ _ E _""

- Position 2: ?

T is excluded?

What about ""CLEFS""? C-L-E-F-S? But then E at position3? But we need E at position4? So pattern: positions? 1:C,2:L,3:E,4:F? But E at position3? No? So we need position4:E? So position3 must not be E? 

Therefore: we need a word: first letter C, fourth letter E, last letter something? And middle letters? 

So back to ""CUBES""? But U? Or ""CIDER"": has R? Excluded? Cannot? Or ""CIDED"": D? But ""CIDED"" has E at position4? C-I-D-E-D? That's C at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, D at5? But it has D twice?

Similarly? ""CUBES"" also valid? 

Now? Both? We choose one? 

But we must also know? What about the previous feedback? We have tested? We tested C (at1)? E (at4)? So for ""CLUES"": 
- Position1: C ✓ (known) 
- Position2: L -> new? 
- Position3: U -> new? 
- Position4: E ✓ (known) 
- Position5: S -> new? 

Similarly? ""CUBES"": U,B,S? 

Which letters are more common? L,U? vs? U,B? 

We have tested nothing? S is good? 

We might choose ""CLUES"" because it has S? Which is common? 

Or ""CUBES"" with B? 

But let's consider possible words? Also, we know the secret word? Doesn't contain E at other positions? We don't know? So guessing L at position2? And U at3? 

We can do? 

We also know that from guess1: E(-)? But we placed E at5? And it was wrong? Now we know E at4? So no issue? 

How about? We can try to include letters that reduce possibilities? 

List possible English words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" without R,A,N,O,M,T? 

Possible? 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S 
- ""CLUES"": C-L-U-E-S 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""CUZES"": not common? 
- ""CEDED"": not common? 
- ""CIDED"": C-I-D-E-D? Has D twice? And I,D? 
- ""CIGES"": not common? 
- ""CISES"": might be C-I-S-E-S? S twice? 
- ""CURES"": R excluded? 
- ""CUSES"": S twice? 
- ""CYLES"": not common? 

So likely only a few: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES"", ""CIDES"" (rare)? Probably ""CUBES"" and ""CLUES"" are common? 

We could also have words like ""CHEWY""? E at position3? No? Must E at4? 

What about ""CHEAP""? A excluded? 

Or ""CHEEK"": double E? 

But E at position3? Not? 

Therefore? Common words: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES""? 

Also? ""CAKES"": excluded? 

So? Guess either? Let's choose ""CLUES""? Because it includes L? And U? And S? 

If we guess ""CLUES"", we test L, U, S? 

If the word is ""CLUES"", we win? 

Similarly? 

But note? There is also ""CUBES""? 

So the word could be one of these? 

But we have 4 guesses left? If we guess ""CLUES"", and it's the one? Then done? Otherwise? We get feedback? 

Similarly? 

But we don't know? 

So? Step? 

We should pick one? 

Idea? We could choose a word that uses letters to differentiate? But we don't know? 

Since both ""CLUES"" and ""CUBES"" exist? We guess ""CLUES""? 

Note? There are other possibilities? Like ""CULLS""? But E missing? Must have E? Or ""CULLS"" doesn't have E? So not? 

Or ""CYST"": but not E at end? 

Only words fitting? 

Another? ""CUED"": not 5 letters? 

So? We pick ""CLUES"" as the guess? 

Therefore? we guess ""CLUES""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: crane**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms the first letter is **C**.
     - `R(x)`, `A(x)`, `N(x)`: Letters **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word.
     - `E(-)`: **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
   
   - **Guess 2: comet**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms position 1 is still **C** (as expected).
     - `O(x)`, `M(x)`, `T(x)`: Letters **O**, **M**, and **T** are not in the word.
     - `E(✓)`: Confirms **E** is in position 4.

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Position 1**: **C** (fixed).
   - **Position 4**: **E** (fixed).
   - **Excluded letters**: **R, A, N, O, M, T** (confirmed absent).
   - **E** must appear in the word, and we now know its position (4), so it cannot be duplicated elsewhere unless necessary (but duplicates are rare; avoid for now).
   - The word format: `C _ _ E _` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown).
   - Remaining letters to explore: Consonants like **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y** and vowels like **I, U** (since **A, O** are excluded).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Focus on positions 2, 3, and 5 with new, common letters not yet tested or excluded.
   - Prioritize letters like **L, S, U, I, H** (high frequency) to maximize information.
   - Aim for a valid English word fitting `C _ _ E _` without using excluded letters.
   - Possible candidate words:
     - `CUBES`: Tests **U**, **B**, **S** (valid word, but **B** and **U** are less common).
     - `CLUES`: Tests **L**, **U**, **S** (common letters; **L** and **S** are highly frequent).
     - `CIDES`: Less common; avoid for better information.
     - `CHESS`: Invalid position (would place **E** at pos 3, not pos 4).
   - **Choosing ""CLUES""**:
     - Covers **L** (position 2), **U** (position 3), and **S** (position 5).
     - All letters are distinct and new (not excluded or previously guessed).
     - Tests frequent letters: **L**, **S**, and **U** can help narrow down possibilities significantly.
     - If correct, wins; if not, feedback positions **L**, **U**, **S** will reveal more (e.g., if **S** is absent or **U** is correct).

4. **Why not other words?**
   - `CUBES` is also valid but tests less common letters like **B** and **U**. **B** is rarer than **L** or **S**.
   - Words like `CAKES` or `CURES` include excluded letters (**A**, **R**).

Based on this, **CLUES** is the best guess to test high-frequency letters in the unknown positions.",Guess 3: clues -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) U(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get. 
It's often recommended to use words that have a good mix of common vowels and consonants, and avoid repeating letters.
Common starting words in games like Wordle are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

After evaluating, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E (including two vowels A and E, and three common consonants).

So my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Format the response as required.I am making the first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I want to choose a starting word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. An ideal starting word:
- Contains common letters to increase the chance of hitting correct positions or existing letters.
- Builds around frequently used vowels and consonants in English.
- Has unique letters (no duplicates) to test more letters with one guess.

Based on Wordle strategy, words like ""CRANE"" are effective because they include:
- Two common vowels (A, E)
- Three common consonants (C, R, N)
- All unique letters, covering 5 distinct letters.

Therefore, I will start with ""CRANE"" to gather initial feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).
2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.
3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.
4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.
5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.
- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it's wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).

Given the constraints:
- First letter: C
- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that's C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid R, A, N.

Additionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with C.
- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Does not contain R, A, N.

We also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven't tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

Possible positions for E:
- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.

We can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as 'wrong position' meaning it's present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it's -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.

Therefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that's C). So only positions 2,3,4.

We also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.

We need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.

Let's think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn't at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn't say it cannot be at positions that we didn't guess. But note: we only know it's not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don't know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We don't know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.

But we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.

Let's list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:

Avoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.

Common words starting with C and containing E:

- Words without A, R, N: 
Possible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.

But what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

Vowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.
Consonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.

We want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.

Idea: Place E at position 2? But let's not fix its position? We need to find the position.

Alternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it's there.

Example words:
- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:
Common words: 
  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.
- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). 
- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don't know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.

But we don't know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.

Another: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn't be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got '-' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn't be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it's still marked '-', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that's already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes 'x' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect '-'? Because it's still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It's wiser.

Therefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.

But note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that's taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.

Therefore, in our next guess, we must have:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don't know? But guessing a word with two E's might be possible? But let's avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That's better.

So let us choose a word that:
- Starts with C
- Does not contain R, A, N
- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don't know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E's position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else '-' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let's choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let's choose position 3? Or position 2?

Alternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:

Case: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get '-' or 'x'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:

  ✓: then we know E is at position2.

  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it's at position3 or 4? 

  x: won't happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get 'x'; at worst we get '-'

Similarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.

So we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down? Moreover:

We haven't tested positions 2,3,4? So placing E at a particular position will tell us about that position?

But we might also guess a word that doesn't commit to E's position? Impossible? Wait: we must contain E? And we have positions 2,3,4 to place? So we have to choose one? 

To maximize information: we can choose a word that uses E but also many new letters? Without R,A,N.

So let me try:

Common words: 
- ""CHOSE"": but E at the end? But if we put E at position5, we know it's not correct? But if we put E at position4? How? ""CHOSE"" is positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=O, 4=S, 5=E -> E at 5? We shouldn't put E at5? We know E is not at5? So that's not useful? If we guess ""CHOSE"", we put E at5 -> we will get '-' again? Because same as above? Also, then we don't test E at position4? So that's inefficient.

Therefore, choose a word that has E in position2,3, or4? And new letters? And avoid A,R,N.

Possible words:

Position2: E -> then we can have C E ? ? ? 
  Options: ""CELEB"" (not common), ""CEILI"" (not common), ""CEDES"", ""CEILS"" etc.
But also: ""CELLO"" -> C-E-L-L-O -> but two L's? We don't test many new? But letter L is repeated? Not ideal? 

Position3: C ? E ? ? 
  Options: ""CUED"" is 4? ""CUES"" is 4? 
  5 letters: ""CHOSE"" -> but E at5? Not in middle?
  ""BLEEP"" doesn't start with C?
  ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T -> E at4? But that's allowed? Because E is at position4? And then T at position5? 

But does ""COMET"" avoid A,R,N? Yes: O,M,E,T -> no A,R,N? So that's OK.

Position4: C ? ? E ? 
  Example: ""COSTE"" -> but we have T and E? But we don't know? Words: ""CLINE"", ""CUTES"", etc.

But let's think about maximizing new letters:

Using ""COMET"": 
- C: known at position1? So if we guess ""COMET"":
  Position1: C -> ✓ (unless the word has C at start? We know it does? So ✓)
  Position2: O -> it may be ✓ or '-' or 'x'
  Position3: M -> same
  Position4: E -> we expect '-' or ✓? But we know E is in the word at positions 2,3,4? So if we put E at4, it could be ✓ (if E is at4) or '-' (if E is at2 or3)
  Position5: T -> it will be 'x', '-' or '✓'?

But we are introducing O, M, T? That's three new letters? Plus E? Actually, E we already know? But T is new? And O and M are also new? So that's good? Also no duplicate letters? And all 5 distinct: C,O,M,E,T.

But what if we try ""CELLO"": has two L's so only tests C,E,L,O? That's less efficient.

Another candidate: ""CHOSE""? But we must avoid putting E at5? And at position5 we already know E is not? So let's not? Then why not ""CHOSE""? Because ""CHOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is not the position? So we would get the same feedback for E? '-', but then for other letters? We can see? Actually, but position5 is E? Then we know feedback? We already know E is not at5? So guessing E at5 again doesn't help? So it's wasting the position5? We can use position5 for another letter? And put E elsewhere.

So ""COMET"" looks good? Let me check if it is a valid word? Yes? And it's 5-letter? Yes.

But wait: what about ""CLEAR""? Has A? But we must avoid A? So not.

What about ""CUPID""? But has I and D? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? So we cannot skip E.

So we must include E? Therefore, choose a word that starts with C, includes E, doesn't have A,R,N? and preferably unique letters? And avoid placing E at5? 

So ""COMET"": 
- C (position1)
- O (position2): new letter? Then M (position3)? Then E (position4)? Then T (position5)?

But we avoid E at5? So E is at4? We want to place E at a position we haven't tried? We tried position5? So now position4? So that's good? And we test three letters: O, M, T.

Alternatively, we could place E at2? Then we need letters? For example: ""CEILS""? 
""CEILS"": C-E-I-L-S? Avoids A,R,N? And letters? E is at2? Then I at3? L at4? S at5? That is good? But then we test I, L, S.

Which one is better? It depends? Both are valid? Let's see frequent letters? T is common? S is common? 

Another candidate: ""COPSE""? But that's C-O-P-S-E -> again E at5? So avoid? 

""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E -> E at5? Avoid? None? 

""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:

Position2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That's good? 

So ""CELTS"": 
- Position1: C -> ✓
- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.

Also, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? 

""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? 

Which one? Compare:

With ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else '-' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? 

With ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? 

Which letter is more common? T, S? Both common? 

But note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was '-'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? 

We might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? 

But similarly? 

I think both are OK? But let me see? 

Idea: Since we don't have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: 
Problem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? 

But also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn't have? So it's valid? 

But ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? 

But its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? 

Now? Which one? 

I think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? 

But also common letters? 

Actually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? 

But wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? 

Perhaps try covering more vowels? We haven't tested I,O,U? 

""COMET"" has O? 

""CHEST"" has E? 

But O is a vowel? 

So ""COMET"": O and M,T? 

But O is a vowel? Then why not?

Since E is present? Then let's not worry about vowels? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? 

So? We must include E? 

So choose one? 

I recall that a common second word? But situation is? 

Let me choose ""COMET"" because:

First guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? 

Thus? We will get:

Feedback: 
Position1: C is ✓
Position2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or '-' or 'x')
Position3: M -> ?
Position4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or '-'
Position5: T -> ?

But we also are introducing O,M? T? 

Alternatively? 

If we choose a word that doesn't contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? 

Therefore? Let's go with ""COMET""? 

But wait? What if? 

I think ""COMET"" is good? 

Another idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? 

For example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can't? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? 

Similarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? 

So ""COMET"" seems optimal? 

But? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? 

""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? 

Therefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?

Both are acceptable? 

I'll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? 

So guess: ""COMET""

But wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? '-'? Etc? 

It's fine? 

Therefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).

For the second guess:
- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).
- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.
- It must exclude R, A, and N.
- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.

""COMET"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).
- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).

- O(x): Not in the word.
- M(x): Not in the word.
- E(✓): Correct and in position 4 (since we placed E there and it got ✓).
- T(x): Not in the word.

What we know now:
1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1).
2. Position 4 is ""E"" (from E(✓) in guess 2).
3. The word contains ""E"" at position 4, so the feedback from guess 1 (E(-)) must have been because E was not in position 5, but we now know it's in position 4.
4. R, A, N, O, M, T are all not in the word (excluded).

Also, since E is fixed at position 4, we can deduce:
- The word is of the form: C _ _ E _

Remaining positions: 2 and 3 and 5. We have three unknown positions.

We have excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T.

So available letters: All letters except these and those used? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. But E is included? We should not exclude E? Only the excluded ones are R, A, N, O, M, T? Also, C is known? C is in? So excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T. And we know E is in? But now we have E at position 4? 

We can also recall that in word games, we need to avoid the excluded letters? So the set of available letters: any English alphabet letter except R, A, N, O, M, T? And including E? But E is already placed? So we need to fill in positions 2,3 and 5? But E is only at position 4? So we have three positions? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We may not use E in other positions? The word might have duplicate E? But we don't know? We placed it only once? Since in ""comet"" we got E at position4? Then we know E is at position4? But we don't know about other E's? We can avoid? Or use? 

Since we don't have any clue about possibility of duplicate E, it's safer to avoid? Because not too frequent? 

Therefore: for positions 2,3,5: we must choose letters from that set? 

We have to form a valid English word? So words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" 

We also know that E must be? The word ends with E? Position4:E, position5:unknown? But it's not E? Unless double E? But we avoid? So position5? Unknown? 

How to choose? We must maximize information? We want to test multiple letters? So pick a word that uses three new letters (since we have three positions)? And avoid duplicate E? 

Possible words:

The pattern: ""C _ _ E _""

- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 5: ?

We must avoid the excluded letters: A, R, N, O, M, T? And include only other letters? 

For example, consider common letters: S, L, I, D, U, etc.? 

Possible words: 
- ""CUESE""? Not a word? Must be valid English word? 
- ""CEDES"": C E D E S? But has E twice? And D? Also? Position2: E? We know? But C at1? And position4:E? So would have two E's? But if we guess ""CEDES"", then position1:C? Position2:E? Position4:E? That could be?

But we already know E is at position4? So if we put E at position2? Then we might get feedback? And D? And S? 

But let's see? 

Also, ""CEDES"" uses E twice? And we haven't tested E at2? But we know E is present only from position4? So if E is at2? Then its occurrence? But it might be? 

But our goal is to deduce the word? So we can try? But for maximizing info? Avoid duplicates? 

Look for words without duplicates? 

For example: 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S: U at2, B at3, E at4, S at5: letters U,B,S? But avoids excluded? 

Similarly? 
- ""CHESS"": but has S twice? Avoid duplicates? 
- ""CLIPS"": C-L-I-P-S: then pattern? Position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? But it does not fit? Because pattern: position1:C, position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? -> ""CLIES""? But ""CLIES"" isn't a common word? 

What are common words fitting ""C??E?""? 

Examples:
- ""CABLE"": A is excluded? Cannot? 
- ""CEDED"": has E twice? and D? Not common? 
- ""CELLS"": has L twice? 
- ""CHIPS"": but position4:E? So ""CHI E S""? Does not match pattern? 
The word must have E at position4? 

Valid words: 
- ""CUBES"" : C-U-B-E-S 
- ""COPES"": but O is excluded? Cannot? 
- ""CIDES"": C-I-D-E-S -> ""CIDES""? Not common? 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""DICES"": doesn't start with C? 
- ""HICES"": similarly? 

Better? 
- ""CULET"": but T excluded? And not common? 
T is excluded? 

Another? ""CUZES""? Not valid? 

What about ""CLEFS""? C-L-E-F-S? But then E at position3? But we need E at position4? So pattern: positions? 1:C,2:L,3:E,4:F? But E at position3? No? So we need position4:E? So position3 must not be E? 

Therefore: we need a word: first letter C, fourth letter E, last letter something? And middle letters? 

So back to ""CUBES""? But U? Or ""CIDER"": has R? Excluded? Cannot? Or ""CIDED"": D? But ""CIDED"" has E at position4? C-I-D-E-D? That's C at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, D at5? But it has D twice? 

But also? R is excluded? So ""CIDER"" cannot? Because R? 

What about ""CHEVY""? But E at position3? Not? We need E at position4? 

Pattern: ""CXXEX"" where ""XX"" are any? 

Then: 
Word: ""CUKES""? K? 
""CUTES"": T excluded? 
""CAGES"": A excluded? 
""CAKES"": A excluded? 

It's tricky? 

Another possibility: ""BYTES"" isn't start with C? 

Perhaps ""CLEWS"": C-L-E-W-S? But E at position3? Not 4? Then if we guess? Position1:C? Then position2:L? Position3:E? But our pattern has position3 as blank? So E must be at4? 

Alternatively? Think: 
- We have ""C _ _ E _"", so letter at position3 is before E? 

Valid words: 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S -> valid? 
- ""CIDES"": not common? 
- ""CUSEC"": not common? 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""CLEEK"": E? 
""CLEEK"": C-L-E-E-K -> E at3? Not? 

Wait? How about ""CLUES""? C-L-U-E-S -> position4:E? Yes? So ""CLUES"": C at1, L at2, U at3, E at4, S at5? 

Also, ""CLUES"" uses letters? C,L,U,E,S? All distinct? And avoids excluded? 

Similarly? ""CUBES"" also valid? 

Now? Both? We choose one? 

But we must also know? What about the previous feedback? We have tested? We tested C (at1)? E (at4)? So for ""CLUES"": 
- Position1: C ✓ (known) 
- Position2: L -> new? 
- Position3: U -> new? 
- Position4: E ✓ (known) 
- Position5: S -> new? 

Similarly? ""CUBES"": U,B,S? 

Which letters are more common? L,U? vs? U,B? 

We have tested nothing? S is good? 

We might choose ""CLUES"" because it has S? Which is common? 

Or ""CUBES"" with B? 

But let's consider possible words? Also, we know the secret word? Doesn't contain E at other positions? We don't know? So guessing L at position2? And U at3? 

We can do? 

We also know that from guess1: E(-)? But we placed E at5? And it was wrong? Now we know E at4? So no issue? 

How about? We can try to include letters that reduce possibilities? 

List possible English words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" without R,A,N,O,M,T? 

Possible? 
- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S 
- ""CLUES"": C-L-U-E-S 
- ""CAVES"": A excluded? 
- ""CUZES"": not common? 
- ""CEDED"": not common? 
- ""CIDED"": C-I-D-E-D? Has D twice? And I,D? 
- ""CIGES"": not common? 
- ""CISES"": might be C-I-S-E-S? S twice? 
- ""CURES"": R excluded? 
- ""CUSES"": S twice? 
- ""CYLES"": not common? 

So likely only a few: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES"", ""CIDES"" (rare)? Probably ""CUBES"" and ""CLUES"" are common? 

We could also have words like ""CHEWY""? E at position3? No? Must E at4? 

What about ""CHEAP""? A excluded? 

Or ""CHEEK"": double E? 

But E at position3? Not? 

Therefore? Common words: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES""? 

Also? ""CAKES"": excluded? 

So? Guess either? Let's choose ""CLUES""? Because it includes L? And U? And S? 

If we guess ""CLUES"", we test L, U, S? 

If the word is ""CLUES"", we win? 

Similarly? 

But note? There is also ""CUBES""? 

So the word could be one of these? 

But we have 4 guesses left? If we guess ""CLUES"", and it's the one? Then done? Otherwise? We get feedback? 

Similarly? 

But we don't know? 

So? Step? 

We should pick one? 

Idea? We could choose a word that uses letters to differentiate? But we don't know? 

Since both ""CLUES"" and ""CUBES"" exist? We guess ""CLUES""? 

Note? There are other possibilities? Like ""CULLS""? But E missing? Must have E? Or ""CULLS"" doesn't have E? So not? 

Or ""CYST"": but not E at end? 

Only words fitting? 

Another? ""CUED"": not 5 letters? 

So? We pick ""CLUES"" as the guess? 

Therefore? we guess ""CLUES""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: crane**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms the first letter is **C**.
     - `R(x)`, `A(x)`, `N(x)`: Letters **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word.
     - `E(-)`: **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
   
   - **Guess 2: comet**
     - `C(✓)`: Confirms position 1 is still **C** (as expected).
     - `O(x)`, `M(x)`, `T(x)`: Letters **O**, **M**, and **T** are not in the word.
     - `E(✓)`: Confirms **E** is in position 4.

2. **Summary of Known Information:**
   - **Position 1**: **C** (fixed).
   - **Position 4**: **E** (fixed).
   - **Excluded letters**: **R, A, N, O, M, T** (confirmed absent).
   - **E** must appear in the word, and we now know its position (4), so it cannot be duplicated elsewhere unless necessary (but duplicates are rare; avoid for now).
   - The word format: `C _ _ E _` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown).
   - Remaining letters to explore: Consonants like **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y** and vowels like **I, U** (since **A, O** are excluded).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Focus on positions 2, 3, and 5 with new, common letters not yet tested or excluded.
   - Prioritize letters like **L, S, U, I, H** (high frequency) to maximize information.
   - Aim for a valid English word fitting `C _ _ E _` without using excluded letters.
   - Possible candidate words:
     - `CUBES`: Tests **U**, **B**, **S** (valid word, but **B** and **U** are less common).
     - `CLUES`: Tests **L**, **U**, **S** (common letters; **L** and **S** are highly frequent).
     - `CIDES`: Less common; avoid for better information.
     - `CHESS`: Invalid position (would place **E** at pos 3, not pos 4).
   - **Choosing ""CLUES""**:
     - Covers **L** (position 2), **U** (position 3), and **S** (position 5).
     - All letters are distinct and new (not excluded or previously guessed).
     - Tests frequent letters: **L**, **S**, and **U** can help narrow down possibilities significantly.
     - If correct, wins; if not, feedback positions **L**, **U**, **S** will reveal more (e.g., if **S** is absent or **U** is correct).

4. **Why not other words?**
   - `CUBES` is also valid but tests less common letters like **B** and **U**. **B** is rarer than **L** or **S**.
   - Words like `CAKES` or `CURES` include excluded letters (**A**, **R**).

Based on this, **CLUES** is the best guess to test high-frequency letters in the unknown positions.

The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (position 1).\n2. The letter R is NOT in the secret word at all.\n3. The letter A is NOT in the secret word at all.\n4. The letter N is NOT in the secret word at all.\n5. The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (where we placed it).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word starts with \'C\'.\n- The secret word does not contain the letters R, A, N.\n- The secret word does contain the letter E, somewhere except the last position? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed it at the end (position 5) and it\'s wrong, it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by C).\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- First letter: C\n- Must contain E, but not at position 5 (and not at position 1 because that\'s C). So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- We must avoid R, A, N.\n\nAdditionally, we have not used any other letters. We must pick a new 5-letter word that:\n- Begins with C.\n- Contains E in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n- Does not contain R, A, N.\n\nWe also want to maximize information. So we should try to include frequent letters that we haven\'t tested yet, such as S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Since the first position is C, E must be at position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe can consider words of the form: C _ E _ _ OR C _ _ E _ OR C _ _ _ E? But wait, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. Note: We put E at position 5 and it was marked as \'wrong position\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. So E can be in position 2, 3, or 4? Actually, it could be at position 5? No, because then it would be correct? But the feedback was wrong position. So if the word ended with E and we guessed E at 5, it would be ✓. Since it\'s -, it means E is in the word but not at 5.\n\nTherefore, E must appear in positions 1 to 4. But position 1 is taken by C, so positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, we also know E is not at position 5 (as per our guess) and not at position 1 (because that\'s C). So only positions 2,3,4.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, A, N.\n\nWe need to come up with a word that fits: C, then two or three other letters plus E.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end? Actually, it can be at the end but in the feedback it wasn\'t at 5? Not exactly: the feedback doesn\'t say it cannot be at positions that we didn\'t guess. But note: we only know it\'s not at the fifth position? Actually, we guessed E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so E is in the word but not at position 5. We don\'t know about position 2, 3, 4: it could be at any of these? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nWe don\'t know the exact position of E, so we can try a word where E is in position 3, for example, to test the middle.\n\nBut we can also try a word that has E and other common letters.\n\nLet\'s list some words starting with C and having E? Example: ""CHASE"", ""COMET"", ""CISEL"", etc., but we must avoid R, A, N. So:\n\nAvoid A, R, N. So words cannot have A, R, N.\n\nCommon words starting with C and containing E:\n\n- Words without A, R, N: \nPossible: ""CHEWY""? But we need 5 letters. ""CHEWY"" is 5? C-H-E-W-Y -> but E is at position 3.\n\nBut what is the set of available letters? We know excluded: R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.\n\nVowels: We have used A (excluded) and E (included). Remaining vowels: I, O, U, sometimes Y.\nConsonants: We have used C (fixed at start), and excluded R and N. So avoid R, A, N.\n\nWe want to test as many letters as possible? But also we have E to place.\n\nIdea: Place E at position 2? But let\'s not fix its position? We need to find the position.\n\nAlternatively, we might try a word that puts E at position 2 to test whether it\'s there.\n\nExample words:\n- ""CESTI"" (not common, and not 5 letters? Actually, cest is not a word). Maybe:\nCommon words: \n  ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> if we guess this, we test E at 2 and then L,T,S.\n- ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters: celeb is 5? C-E-L-E-B -> but has E twice? And not a common word). \n- ""CHEEK"": C-H-E-E-K -> has E repeated? And we don\'t know if the word has double E? Also, we want unique letters to cover more ground? Since we are early.\n\nBut we don\'t know the letter set, so having unique letters is often better.\n\nAnother: ""CHOSE"": C-H-O-S-E -> E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5? So if we put E at 5 and the secret word has it at 5, it would be ✓, but feedback says not at 5? Actually, the secret word E is not at 5? Earlier we deduced E is in the word but not at 5? So putting E at 5 again wouldn\'t be correct? But actually, if the secret word has E at 5, then we guessed E at 5 and should get ✓. But we got \'-\' meaning E is present but not at 5. So E is in the word at position 2, 3, or 4? Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 because we know it shouldn\'t be there? Or we can? You could but it would give less information? Actually, no: if we put E at 5 and it\'s still marked \'-\', that would tell us E is still present but not at 5, but that\'s already known? However, if we put E at 5 and it becomes \'x\' that would be inconsistent? But we know for sure E is in the word? So if we put E at 5 again, we would expect \'-\'? Because it\'s still the same E? So it would not tell us anything new? Hence to save position 5 for another letter? It\'s wiser.\n\nTherefore, in the new guess, put E in a new position: position 2, 3 or 4? And avoid reuse of position 5 for E? We can avoid it.\n\nBut note: we cannot put E in position 1 since that\'s taken by C? No, position 1 is fixed as C? Because we know C is at position 1? So E must be in 2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we must have:\n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2, 3, or 4: E? Actually, E could be in any of these? But we put E in only one of them? Because the word might have E only once? Or multiple times? We don\'t know? But guessing a word with two E\'s might be possible? But let\'s avoid duplicates to cover more letters? That\'s better.\n\nSo let us choose a word that:\n- Starts with C\n- Does not contain R, A, N\n- Contains E in position 2, OR position 3, OR position 4? But we don\'t know? So we can pick one? Or choose a word that also has other common letters? We want to test E\'s position? So we could try placing E at position 2? If it gets ✓ then we know position, or else \'-\' at position 2? Alternatively, we might choose a word that places E at a position we suspect? Without previous data? So we can pick any? But to maximize information, let\'s choose a word that introduces three new letters? And place E in position 2? Or position 3? Typically, vowels are often in the middle. Let\'s choose position 3? Or position 2?\n\nAlternative: Do we test if there are other letters? We know only that there is one E? And we know E is somewhere? So putting E at position 2 might give:\n\nCase: If E is at pos2 -> then we get ✓ for position2? But if not, we get \'-\' or \'x\'? We already know E is in the word? So if we put it at position2, we can either get:\n\n  ✓: then we know E is at position2.\n\n  -: then E is in the word but not at position2? Then we know it\'s at position3 or 4? \n\n  x: won\'t happen because we know E is in the word? So we will not get \'x\'; at worst we get \'-\'\n\nSimilarly, if we put it at position3, same logic.\n\nSo we can try having E at a new position? To narrow down? Moreover:\n\nWe haven\'t tested positions 2,3,4? So placing E at a particular position will tell us about that position?\n\nBut we might also guess a word that doesn\'t commit to E\'s position? Impossible? Wait: we must contain E? And we have positions 2,3,4 to place? So we have to choose one? \n\nTo maximize information: we can choose a word that uses E but also many new letters? Without R,A,N.\n\nSo let me try:\n\nCommon words: \n- ""CHOSE"": but E at the end? But if we put E at position5, we know it\'s not correct? But if we put E at position4? How? ""CHOSE"" is positions: 1=C, 2=H, 3=O, 4=S, 5=E -> E at 5? We shouldn\'t put E at5? We know E is not at5? So that\'s not useful? If we guess ""CHOSE"", we put E at5 -> we will get \'-\' again? Because same as above? Also, then we don\'t test E at position4? So that\'s inefficient.\n\nTherefore, choose a word that has E in position2,3, or4? And new letters? And avoid A,R,N.\n\nPossible words:\n\nPosition2: E -> then we can have C E ? ? ? \n  Options: ""CELEB"" (not common), ""CEILI"" (not common), ""CEDES"", ""CEILS"" etc.\nBut also: ""CELLO"" -> C-E-L-L-O -> but two L\'s? We don\'t test many new? But letter L is repeated? Not ideal? \n\nPosition3: C ? E ? ? \n  Options: ""CUED"" is 4? ""CUES"" is 4? \n  5 letters: ""CHOSE"" -> but E at5? Not in middle?\n  ""BLEEP"" doesn\'t start with C?\n  ""COMET"": C-O-M-E-T -> E at4? But that\'s allowed? Because E is at position4? And then T at position5? \n\nBut does ""COMET"" avoid A,R,N? Yes: O,M,E,T -> no A,R,N? So that\'s OK.\n\nPosition4: C ? ? E ? \n  Example: ""COSTE"" -> but we have T and E? But we don\'t know? Words: ""CLINE"", ""CUTES"", etc.\n\nBut let\'s think about maximizing new letters:\n\nUsing ""COMET"": \n- C: known at position1? So if we guess ""COMET"":\n  Position1: C -> ✓ (unless the word has C at start? We know it does? So ✓)\n  Position2: O -> it may be ✓ or \'-\' or \'x\'\n  Position3: M -> same\n  Position4: E -> we expect \'-\' or ✓? But we know E is in the word at positions 2,3,4? So if we put E at4, it could be ✓ (if E is at4) or \'-\' (if E is at2 or3)\n  Position5: T -> it will be \'x\', \'-\' or \'✓\'?\n\nBut we are introducing O, M, T? That\'s three new letters? Plus E? Actually, E we already know? But T is new? And O and M are also new? So that\'s good? Also no duplicate letters? And all 5 distinct: C,O,M,E,T.\n\nBut what if we try ""CELLO"": has two L\'s so only tests C,E,L,O? That\'s less efficient.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CHOSE""? But we must avoid putting E at5? And at position5 we already know E is not? So let\'s not? Then why not ""CHOSE""? Because ""CHOSE"" ends with E? Which we know is not the position? So we would get the same feedback for E? \'-\', but then for other letters? We can see? Actually, but position5 is E? Then we know feedback? We already know E is not at5? So guessing E at5 again doesn\'t help? So it\'s wasting the position5? We can use position5 for another letter? And put E elsewhere.\n\nSo ""COMET"" looks good? Let me check if it is a valid word? Yes? And it\'s 5-letter? Yes.\n\nBut wait: what about ""CLEAR""? Has A? But we must avoid A? So not.\n\nWhat about ""CUPID""? But has I and D? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? So we cannot skip E.\n\nSo we must include E? Therefore, choose a word that starts with C, includes E, doesn\'t have A,R,N? and preferably unique letters? And avoid placing E at5? \n\nSo ""COMET"": \n- C (position1)\n- O (position2): new letter? Then M (position3)? Then E (position4)? Then T (position5)?\n\nBut we avoid E at5? So E is at4? We want to place E at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried position5? So now position4? So that\'s good? And we test three letters: O, M, T.\n\nAlternatively, we could place E at2? Then we need letters? For example: ""CEILS""? \n""CEILS"": C-E-I-L-S? Avoids A,R,N? And letters? E is at2? Then I at3? L at4? S at5? That is good? But then we test I, L, S.\n\nWhich one is better? It depends? Both are valid? Let\'s see frequent letters? T is common? S is common? \n\nAnother candidate: ""COPSE""? But that\'s C-O-P-S-E -> again E at5? So avoid? \n\n""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E -> E at5? Avoid? None? \n\n""We need to have E not at the end? Let me think of words that start with C and have E? Not in position1? So position2,3,4:\n\nPosition2: E? Words: ""CEASE"": has A? excluded? ""CELEB"" invalid? ""CELTS"": valid? ""CELTS"": C-E-L-T-S -> which includes E at2? Then L,T,S? Avoids A,R,N? Yes? And letters E at2? That\'s good? \n\nSo ""CELTS"": \n- Position1: C -> ✓\n- Position2: E -> this will tell us if E is at position2? Then L, T, S in positions 3,4,5? And then we test L,T,S.\n\nAlso, ""CELTS"" has distinct letters? Yes? \n\n""COMET"": E at4? That also distinct letters? \n\nWhich one? Compare:\n\nWith ""CELTS"": we test E at position2? So if E is at position2, we get ✓? Then we know E at2? Else \'-\' meaning E is at position3 or4? And then we test L,T,S? But L,T,S are new? Not previously used? \n\nWith ""COMET"": we test O at2? And M at3? And E at4? And T at5? So we get information about O? \n\nWhich letter is more common? T, S? Both common? \n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""crane"", E at5 was \'-\'? So E exists? And we have excluded R,A,N? \n\nWe might also consider that E at position3? How about a word: ""CITES""? C-I-T-E-S? E at4 and S at5? \n\nBut similarly? \n\nI think both are OK? But let me see? \n\nIdea: Since we don\'t have many constraints? Why not ""CHEST""? But ""CHEST"": has E at position3? But also S and T? But avoid R? And its has H? So C-H-E-S-T? But H is not excluded? Then: \nProblem: ""CHEST"" -> has E? But we can put E at position3? That tests position3? \n\nBut also, we must avoid R? And A,N? ""CHEST"" doesn\'t have? So it\'s valid? \n\nBut ""CHEST"" has the same number of letters? \n\nBut its letters: H,E,S,T? Distinct? And E at3? \n\nNow? Which one? \n\nI think ""CHEST"" is good because it contains E at position3? Then we have H,S,T? Then we test H and S,T? \n\nBut also common letters? \n\nActually, I think ""CHEST"", ""COMET"", ""CELTS"" are equally good? \n\nBut wait: we know the letters not present: R,A,N? And E in the word? C at1? \n\nPerhaps try covering more vowels? We haven\'t tested I,O,U? \n\n""COMET"" has O? \n\n""CHEST"" has E? \n\nBut O is a vowel? \n\nSo ""COMET"": O and M,T? \n\nBut O is a vowel? Then why not?\n\nSince E is present? Then let\'s not worry about vowels? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""COULD""? But no E? Required E? \n\nSo? We must include E? \n\nSo choose one? \n\nI recall that a common second word? But situation is? \n\nLet me choose ""COMET"" because:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE -> C:correct? Then ""COMET"" uses unknown positions? With O at2? Then M at3? Then E at4? Then T at5? \n\nThus? We will get:\n\nFeedback: \nPosition1: C is ✓\nPosition2: O -> will be ? (could be ✓ or \'-\' or \'x\')\nPosition3: M -> ?\nPosition4: E -> we know E is in the word? So either ✓ or \'-\'\nPosition5: T -> ?\n\nBut we also are introducing O,M? T? \n\nAlternatively? \n\nIf we choose a word that doesn\'t contain E? Then it would be invalid? Because we know E is in the word? And we need to include it? So we must? \n\nTherefore? Let\'s go with ""COMET""? \n\nBut wait? What if? \n\nI think ""COMET"" is good? \n\nAnother idea: Since E must be in position2,3, or4? And we have to choose? Why not choose a word that has E at position3? And then common letters? \n\nFor example: ""CHINE""? But H,I,N? N is excluded? N is excluded? We know N is not in the word? But ""CHINE"" has N? So invalid? Because we can\'t? Yes? So we must avoid words containing N? \n\nSimilarly? ""COPSE"": E? at5? Avoid? Then not? \n\nSo ""COMET"" seems optimal? \n\nBut? ""CAUSE"" has A? excluded? \n\n""CRYPT""? has R? excluded? \n\nTherefore? ""COMET"" or ""CELTS""?\n\nBoth are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll pick ""COMET"" because it tests O? which is also common? \n\nSo guess: ""COMET""\n\nBut wait? We must put E somewhere? In ""COMET"", E at position4? So if E were at4? then we get ✓? If E at2? then we get at position4? \'-\'? Etc? \n\nIt\'s fine? \n\nTherefore? I decide to guess ""COMET""?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the correct first position (✓), so the secret word starts with ""C"".\n- R, A, and N are not in the word at all (x), so these letters are excluded.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), meaning E appears in positions 2, 3, or 4 (not position 5, as guessed, and not position 1, which is C).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must start with ""C"" (position 1).\n- It must include E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- It must exclude R, A, and N.\n- To maximize information, use unique, common letters not yet tested (like O, M, T, L, S) and check if E is in position 4.\n\n""COMET"" fits these criteria:\n- Starts with ""C"".\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Includes new letters: O (position 2), M (position 3), and T (position 5).\n- Avoids excluded letters (R, A, N).\n\n<guess>comet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C(✓): Correct and in position 1.\n- R(x): Not in the word.\n- A(x): Not in the word.\n- N(x): Not in the word.\n- E(-): In the word but not in position 5.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""comet""):\n- C(✓): Correct and in position 1 (as expected).\n- O(x): Not in the word.\n- M(x): Not in the word.\n- E(✓): Correct and in position 4 (since we placed E there and it got ✓).\n- T(x): Not in the word.\n\nWhat we know now:\n1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1).\n2. Position 4 is ""E"" (from E(✓) in guess 2).\n3. The word contains ""E"" at position 4, so the feedback from guess 1 (E(-)) must have been because E was not in position 5, but we now know it\'s in position 4.\n4. R, A, N, O, M, T are all not in the word (excluded).\n\nAlso, since E is fixed at position 4, we can deduce:\n- The word is of the form: C _ _ E _\n\nRemaining positions: 2 and 3 and 5. We have three unknown positions.\n\nWe have excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T.\n\nSo available letters: All letters except these and those used? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, T. But E is included? We should not exclude E? Only the excluded ones are R, A, N, O, M, T? Also, C is known? C is in? So excluded letters: R, A, N, O, M, T. And we know E is in? But now we have E at position 4? \n\nWe can also recall that in word games, we need to avoid the excluded letters? So the set of available letters: any English alphabet letter except R, A, N, O, M, T? And including E? But E is already placed? So we need to fill in positions 2,3 and 5? But E is only at position 4? So we have three positions? \n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? We may not use E in other positions? The word might have duplicate E? But we don\'t know? We placed it only once? Since in ""comet"" we got E at position4? Then we know E is at position4? But we don\'t know about other E\'s? We can avoid? Or use? \n\nSince we don\'t have any clue about possibility of duplicate E, it\'s safer to avoid? Because not too frequent? \n\nTherefore: for positions 2,3,5: we must choose letters from that set? \n\nWe have to form a valid English word? So words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" \n\nWe also know that E must be? The word ends with E? Position4:E, position5:unknown? But it\'s not E? Unless double E? But we avoid? So position5? Unknown? \n\nHow to choose? We must maximize information? We want to test multiple letters? So pick a word that uses three new letters (since we have three positions)? And avoid duplicate E? \n\nPossible words:\n\nThe pattern: ""C _ _ E _""\n\n- Position 2: ?\n- Position 3: ?\n- Position 5: ?\n\nWe must avoid the excluded letters: A, R, N, O, M, T? And include only other letters? \n\nFor example, consider common letters: S, L, I, D, U, etc.? \n\nPossible words: \n- ""CUESE""? Not a word? Must be valid English word? \n- ""CEDES"": C E D E S? But has E twice? And D? Also? Position2: E? We know? But C at1? And position4:E? So would have two E\'s? But if we guess ""CEDES"", then position1:C? Position2:E? Position4:E? That could be?\n\nBut we already know E is at position4? So if we put E at position2? Then we might get feedback? And D? And S? \n\nBut let\'s see? \n\nAlso, ""CEDES"" uses E twice? And we haven\'t tested E at2? But we know E is present only from position4? So if E is at2? Then its occurrence? But it might be? \n\nBut our goal is to deduce the word? So we can try? But for maximizing info? Avoid duplicates? \n\nLook for words without duplicates? \n\nFor example: \n- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S: U at2, B at3, E at4, S at5: letters U,B,S? But avoids excluded? \n\nSimilarly? \n- ""CHESS"": but has S twice? Avoid duplicates? \n- ""CLIPS"": C-L-I-P-S: then pattern? Position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? But it does not fit? Because pattern: position1:C, position2:L, position3:I, position4:E? Position5:S? -> ""CLIES""? But ""CLIES"" isn\'t a common word? \n\nWhat are common words fitting ""C??E?""? \n\nExamples:\n- ""CABLE"": A is excluded? Cannot? \n- ""CEDED"": has E twice? and D? Not common? \n- ""CELLS"": has L twice? \n- ""CHIPS"": but position4:E? So ""CHI E S""? Does not match pattern? \nThe word must have E at position4? \n\nValid words: \n- ""CUBES"" : C-U-B-E-S \n- ""COPES"": but O is excluded? Cannot? \n- ""CIDES"": C-I-D-E-S -> ""CIDES""? Not common? \n- ""CAVES"": A excluded? \n- ""DICES"": doesn\'t start with C? \n- ""HICES"": similarly? \n\nBetter? \n- ""CULET"": but T excluded? And not common? \nT is excluded? \n\nAnother? ""CUZES""? Not valid? \n\nWhat about ""CLEFS""? C-L-E-F-S? But then E at position3? But we need E at position4? So pattern: positions? 1:C,2:L,3:E,4:F? But E at position3? No? So we need position4:E? So position3 must not be E? \n\nTherefore: we need a word: first letter C, fourth letter E, last letter something? And middle letters? \n\nSo back to ""CUBES""? But U? Or ""CIDER"": has R? Excluded? Cannot? Or ""CIDED"": D? But ""CIDED"" has E at position4? C-I-D-E-D? That\'s C at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, D at5? But it has D twice? \n\nBut also? R is excluded? So ""CIDER"" cannot? Because R? \n\nWhat about ""CHEVY""? But E at position3? Not? We need E at position4? \n\nPattern: ""CXXEX"" where ""XX"" are any? \n\nThen: \nWord: ""CUKES""? K? \n""CUTES"": T excluded? \n""CAGES"": A excluded? \n""CAKES"": A excluded? \n\nIt\'s tricky? \n\nAnother possibility: ""BYTES"" isn\'t start with C? \n\nPerhaps ""CLEWS"": C-L-E-W-S? But E at position3? Not 4? Then if we guess? Position1:C? Then position2:L? Position3:E? But our pattern has position3 as blank? So E must be at4? \n\nAlternatively? Think: \n- We have ""C _ _ E _"", so letter at position3 is before E? \n\nValid words: \n- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S -> valid? \n- ""CIDES"": not common? \n- ""CUSEC"": not common? \n- ""CAVES"": A excluded? \n- ""CLEEK"": E? \n""CLEEK"": C-L-E-E-K -> E at3? Not? \n\nWait? How about ""CLUES""? C-L-U-E-S -> position4:E? Yes? So ""CLUES"": C at1, L at2, U at3, E at4, S at5? \n\nAlso, ""CLUES"" uses letters? C,L,U,E,S? All distinct? And avoids excluded? \n\nSimilarly? ""CUBES"" also valid? \n\nNow? Both? We choose one? \n\nBut we must also know? What about the previous feedback? We have tested? We tested C (at1)? E (at4)? So for ""CLUES"": \n- Position1: C ✓ (known) \n- Position2: L -> new? \n- Position3: U -> new? \n- Position4: E ✓ (known) \n- Position5: S -> new? \n\nSimilarly? ""CUBES"": U,B,S? \n\nWhich letters are more common? L,U? vs? U,B? \n\nWe have tested nothing? S is good? \n\nWe might choose ""CLUES"" because it has S? Which is common? \n\nOr ""CUBES"" with B? \n\nBut let\'s consider possible words? Also, we know the secret word? Doesn\'t contain E at other positions? We don\'t know? So guessing L at position2? And U at3? \n\nWe can do? \n\nWe also know that from guess1: E(-)? But we placed E at5? And it was wrong? Now we know E at4? So no issue? \n\nHow about? We can try to include letters that reduce possibilities? \n\nList possible English words fitting ""C _ _ E _"" without R,A,N,O,M,T? \n\nPossible? \n- ""CUBES"": C-U-B-E-S \n- ""CLUES"": C-L-U-E-S \n- ""CAVES"": A excluded? \n- ""CUZES"": not common? \n- ""CEDED"": not common? \n- ""CIDED"": C-I-D-E-D? Has D twice? And I,D? \n- ""CIGES"": not common? \n- ""CISES"": might be C-I-S-E-S? S twice? \n- ""CURES"": R excluded? \n- ""CUSES"": S twice? \n- ""CYLES"": not common? \n\nSo likely only a few: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES"", ""CIDES"" (rare)? Probably ""CUBES"" and ""CLUES"" are common? \n\nWe could also have words like ""CHEWY""? E at position3? No? Must E at4? \n\nWhat about ""CHEAP""? A excluded? \n\nOr ""CHEEK"": double E? \n\nBut E at position3? Not? \n\nTherefore? Common words: ""CUBES"", ""CLUES""? \n\nAlso? ""CAKES"": excluded? \n\nSo? Guess either? Let\'s choose ""CLUES""? Because it includes L? And U? And S? \n\nIf we guess ""CLUES"", we test L, U, S? \n\nIf the word is ""CLUES"", we win? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut note? There is also ""CUBES""? \n\nSo the word could be one of these? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? If we guess ""CLUES"", and it\'s the one? Then done? Otherwise? We get feedback? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nSo? Step? \n\nWe should pick one? \n\nIdea? We could choose a word that uses letters to differentiate? But we don\'t know? \n\nSince both ""CLUES"" and ""CUBES"" exist? We guess ""CLUES""? \n\nNote? There are other possibilities? Like ""CULLS""? But E missing? Must have E? Or ""CULLS"" doesn\'t have E? So not? \n\nOr ""CYST"": but not E at end? \n\nOnly words fitting? \n\nAnother? ""CUED"": not 5 letters? \n\nSo? We pick ""CLUES"" as the guess? \n\nTherefore? we guess ""CLUES""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyzing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1: crane**\n     - `C(✓)`: Confirms the first letter is **C**.\n     - `R(x)`, `A(x)`, `N(x)`: Letters **R**, **A**, and **N** are not in the word.\n     - `E(-)`: **E** is in the word but not in position 5.\n   \n   - **Guess 2: comet**\n     - `C(✓)`: Confirms position 1 is still **C** (as expected).\n     - `O(x)`, `M(x)`, `T(x)`: Letters **O**, **M**, and **T** are not in the word.\n     - `E(✓)`: Confirms **E** is in position 4.\n\n2. **Summary of Known Information:**\n   - **Position 1**: **C** (fixed).\n   - **Position 4**: **E** (fixed).\n   - **Excluded letters**: **R, A, N, O, M, T** (confirmed absent).\n   - **E** must appear in the word, and we now know its position (4), so it cannot be duplicated elsewhere unless necessary (but duplicates are rare; avoid for now).\n   - The word format: `C _ _ E _` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown).\n   - Remaining letters to explore: Consonants like **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, S, U, V, W, Y** and vowels like **I, U** (since **A, O** are excluded).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**\n   - Focus on positions 2, 3, and 5 with new, common letters not yet tested or excluded.\n   - Prioritize letters like **L, S, U, I, H** (high frequency) to maximize information.\n   - Aim for a valid English word fitting `C _ _ E _` without using excluded letters.\n   - Possible candidate words:\n     - `CUBES`: Tests **U**, **B**, **S** (valid word, but **B** and **U** are less common).\n     - `CLUES`: Tests **L**, **U**, **S** (common letters; **L** and **S** are highly frequent).\n     - `CIDES`: Less common; avoid for better information.\n     - `CHESS`: Invalid position (would place **E** at pos 3, not pos 4).\n   - **Choosing ""CLUES""**:\n     - Covers **L** (position 2), **U** (position 3), and **S** (position 5).\n     - All letters are distinct and new (not excluded or previously guessed).\n     - Tests frequent letters: **L**, **S**, and **U** can help narrow down possibilities significantly.\n     - If correct, wins; if not, feedback positions **L**, **U**, **S** will reveal more (e.g., if **S** is absent or **U** is correct).\n\n4. **Why not other words?**\n   - `CUBES` is also valid but tests less common letters like **B** and **U**. **B** is rarer than **L** or **S**.\n   - Words like `CAKES` or `CURES` include excluded letters (**A**, **R**).\n\nBased on this, **CLUES** is the best guess to test high-frequency letters in the unknown positions.\n\n<guess>clues</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: comet -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) M(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: clues -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) U(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""comet""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""clues""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- L: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4) [we already knew this]
- S: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1) and has ""E"" at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ _ E _

2. Excluded letters (from all feedback):
   - From guess1: R, A, N
   - From guess2: O, M, T
   - From guess3: L, U, S
   - Also, note that in guess1, E was marked as present but not at position 5, but now we know it's at position 4, so that's consistent.

   Total excluded: R, A, N, O, M, T, L, U, S

3. We know the word must have an E at position 4, and we have no indication of duplicate letters so far, but we cannot rule it out. However, we have tested many letters and they are excluded, so duplicates are less likely.

4. The word is of the form: C _ _ E _

   Positions to fill: 2, 3, and 5.

5. Available letters: We have to avoid the excluded letters. The excluded letters are: A, R, N, O, M, T, L, U, S.

   The English alphabet: A to Z. Remove the excluded ones, so available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

6. We need to form a word: C ? ? E ? with the available letters.

   Possible words? Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with C, have E in the fourth position, and use only the available letters.

   Examples:

   - ""C"" + ? + ? + ""E"" + ?

   We need to fill the second, third, and fifth positions with letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Common possibilities:

   - ""CHI E ?"" -> ""CHIEF""? But ""CHIEF"" is C-H-I-E-F -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:E, 5:F -> that fits? And H, I, F are available? H is available? Yes, not excluded. I is available? Yes. F is available? Yes.

   But is ""CHIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

   - Other options? ""CUD E ?"" but U is excluded? So not.

   - ""CAB E ?"" but A excluded? Not.

   - ""CARE E ?"" but A and R excluded? Not.

   - ""CODE"" has O and E? O excluded? Not.

   - ""CUTE"" has U and T? Both excluded? Not.

   - ""CASE"" has A and S? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CITE"" has I and T? T excluded? Not.

   - ""COZE"" has O? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CUBE"" has U? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CLUE"" has L and U? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CREEK"" is 5 letters? C-R-E-E-K? But R excluded? And E at position 3? Not 4? And we need E at 4? So not.

   - ""CHEWY"": C-H-E-W-Y -> E at position 3? Not 4? So not.

   - ""CHIDE"": C-H-I-D-E -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E? But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D? So not.

   We need E at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter as E? So in ""CHIEF"", it is: C (1), H (2), I (3), E (4), F (5) -> that matches.

   Another possibility: ""CIVET"": C-I-V-E-T -> but T is excluded? So not.

   ""CIG E ?"" -> ""CIGUE""? Not common? Or ""CIGAR"" has A and R? Excluded? Not.

   ""CINE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

   ""CIPES""? Not common? 

   ""CIRE"": not 5.

   ""CITED"": has T? Excluded? Not.

   So ""CHIEF"" seems a strong candidate? 

   But let's check the letters: H, I, F? All are in the available set? Yes.

   Also, we haven't tested H, I, F? So we can get new information.

   But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But now we know E is at position 4? So that E at position 5 was a mistake? But the word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""CHIEF"", position 5 is F? So that's fine.

   Also, we must ensure that the word doesn't have any excluded letters? ""CHIEF"" has C, H, I, E, F? None of the excluded letters? So it's valid.

   Are there other possibilities? 

   Another word: ""CHIDE""? But we need E at position 4? ""CHIDE"" is C-H-I-D-E? Then position 4 is D? And position 5 is E? But we know E must be at position 4? So not? Because in ""CHIDE"", E is at position 5? But we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5? Because when we guessed E at position 5 in ""crane"", it was marked as present but wrong position? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, in the secret word, E is at position 4? So ""CHIDE"" would have E at position 5? Which is not allowed? So invalid.

   Similarly, ""CIVET"": C-I-V-E-T? Position 4 is E? Position 5 is T? But T is excluded? So not.

   ""CREEK"": C-R-E-E-K? R excluded? And E at position 3? Not 4? So not.

   ""CHEVY"": C-H-E-V-Y? Position 3 is E? Not 4? So not.

   So ""CHIEF"" seems to be a good candidate? 

   But what about ""CHIEF""? It fits: C _ _ E _ with H at2, I at3, F at5? And all letters available.

   Another possibility: ""CLEEK""? But L excluded? Not.

   ""CLEF""? Not 5 letters.

   ""CLEPE""? Not common? And L excluded? Not.

   ""CLEW""? Not 5.

   ""CLINE""? L excluded? Not.

   ""COGIE""? O excluded? Not.

   ""COPSE""? O excluded? Not.

   ""COSE""? Not 5.

   ""CREDO""? R excluded? Not.

   ""CREEL""? R excluded? Not.

   ""CREPE""? R excluded? Not.

   ""CRIPE""? R excluded? Not.

   ""CRUDE""? R and U excluded? Not.

   ""CULEX""? U and L excluded? Not.

   ""CUPEL""? U excluded? Not.

   ""CURED""? U and R excluded? Not.

   ""CURET""? U and R excluded? Not.

   ""CURIE""? U and R excluded? Not.

   ""CUTIE""? U and T excluded? Not.

   ""CYCLE""? But L excluded? Not.

   ""CYDER""? Not common? And R excluded? Not.

   ""CYKES""? Not common? 

   ""CYMAS""? Not common? 

   ""CYMES""? Not common? 

   ""CYPRE""? Not common? 

   So ""CHIEF"" is a common word that fits? 

   But wait? Is there ""CHIVE""? C-H-I-V-E? Then position 4 is V? Position 5 is E? But E at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5? Because of guess1? So invalid? 

   Similarly, ""CHIME"": C-H-I-M-E? M excluded? And E at position 5? Invalid.

   ""CHINE"": C-H-I-N-E? N excluded? And E at position 5? Invalid.

   So ""CHIEF"" seems the only common word? 

   But what about ""CHIEL""? L excluded? Not.

   ""CHIRP"": R excluded? Not.

   So I think ""CHIEF"" is the word? 

   But we have to guess? And if not? We get feedback? 

   Alternatively? There might be other words? 

   Another possibility: ""CWIER""? Not a word? 

   Or ""CBIES""? Not? 

   So I think ""CHIEF"" is the best guess? 

   But let's confirm the feedback? 

   If we guess ""CHIEF"": 
   - Position1: C -> ✓ (known)
   - Position2: H -> ? 
   - Position3: I -> ?
   - Position4: E -> ✓ (known)
   - Position5: F -> ?

   We will get feedback on H, I, F? 

   If the word is ""CHIEF"", we win? 

   If not? Then we get which of H, I, F are present? 

   But given the constraints? It might be the only word? 

   However, let's consider: 

   - ""CXI E F""? Not a word? 

   Or ""C H I E F"" is the only common one? 

   Also, we have not tested H, I, F? So it's good to test? 

   Therefore, I choose ""CHIEF"" as the next guess? 

   But note: in the available letters, we have B, D, G, etc.? But no common words? 

   Another word: ""CITED""? But T excluded? Not? 

   ""CIGAR""? A and R excluded? Not? 

   So? 

   We go with ""CHIEF""?

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**
   - **C(✓)**: Correct position (position 1).
   - **R(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **A(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **N(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **E(-)**: In the word but wrong position (not position 5).

2. **Guess 2: ""comet""**
   - **C(✓)**: Correct position (position 1).
   - **O(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **M(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **E(✓)**: Correct position (position 4).
   - **T(x)**: Not in the word.

3. **Guess 3: ""clues""**
   - **C(✓)**: Correct position (position 1).
   - **L(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **U(x)**: Not in the word.
   - **E(✓)**: Correct position (position 4).
   - **S(x)**: Not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 4: **E** (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).
- **Excluded letters (absent from the word)**:  
  R, A, N (from Guess 1), O, M, T (from Guess 2), L, U, S (from Guess 3).  
  Total excluded: **A, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U**.
- **Word structure**: `C _ _ E _` (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown).
- **Available letters**:  
  Letters not yet tested or excluded: **B, D, F, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, Z** (and **E** is already placed at position 4).
- **Constraints**:
  - Position 5 cannot be **E** (from Guess 1 feedback: E not in position 5).
  - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test high-frequency letters from the available set (e.g., **H, I, F, D, G**) in positions 2, 3, and 5.
- **Candidate word**: **""CHIEF""** fits perfectly:
  - **C** (position 1, known), **H** (position 2, new), **I** (position 3, new), **E** (position 4, known), **F** (position 5, new).
  - Uses **H**, **I**, and **F**—common letters that maximize information gain.
  - Avoids all excluded letters and duplicates.
- **Why ""CHIEF""?**  
  It tests:
  - If **H** is in position 2 (common consonant).
  - If **I** is in position 3 (common vowel).
  - If **F** is in position 5 (common ending letter).
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""CHIDE"" (invalid: **D** is untested, but **E** would be in position 5, which is forbidden).  
  - ""CIVET"" (invalid: **T** excluded).  
  - ""CUBES"" (invalid: **U** excluded).  
  ""CHIEF"" is the strongest candidate given the constraints.

<guess>chief</guess>",chief,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""comet""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- O: x (not in word)
- M: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""clues""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- L: x (not in word)
- U: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 4) [we already knew this]
- S: x (not in word)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word starts with ""C"" (position 1) and has ""E"" at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ _ E _

2. Excluded letters (from all feedback):
   - From guess1: R, A, N
   - From guess2: O, M, T
   - From guess3: L, U, S
   - Also, note that in guess1, E was marked as present but not at position 5, but now we know it's at position 4, so that's consistent.

   Total excluded: R, A, N, O, M, T, L, U, S

3. We know the word must have an E at position 4, and we have no indication of duplicate letters so far, but we cannot rule it out. However, we have tested many letters and they are excluded, so duplicates are less likely.

4. The word is of the form: C _ _ E _

   Positions to fill: 2, 3, and 5.

5. Available letters: We have to avoid the excluded letters. The excluded letters are: A, R, N, O, M, T, L, U, S.

   The English alphabet: A to Z. Remove the excluded ones, so available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But we also know that the word must be a valid English word.

6. We need to form a word: C ? ? E ? with the available letters.

   Possible words? Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with C, have E in the fourth position, and use only the available letters.

   Examples:

   - ""C"" + ? + ? + ""E"" + ?

   We need to fill the second, third, and fifth positions with letters from: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Common possibilities:

   - ""CHI E ?"" -> ""CHIEF""? But ""CHIEF"" is C-H-I-E-F -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:E, 5:F -> that fits? And H, I, F are available? H is available? Yes, not excluded. I is available? Yes. F is available? Yes.

   But is ""CHIEF"" a valid word? Yes.

   - Other options? ""CUD E ?"" but U is excluded? So not.

   - ""CAB E ?"" but A excluded? Not.

   - ""CARE E ?"" but A and R excluded? Not.

   - ""CODE"" has O and E? O excluded? Not.

   - ""CUTE"" has U and T? Both excluded? Not.

   - ""CASE"" has A and S? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CITE"" has I and T? T excluded? Not.

   - ""COZE"" has O? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CUBE"" has U? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CLUE"" has L and U? Excluded? Not.

   - ""CREEK"" is 5 letters? C-R-E-E-K? But R excluded? And E at position 3? Not 4? And we need E at 4? So not.

   - ""CHEWY"": C-H-E-W-Y -> E at position 3? Not 4? So not.

   - ""CHIDE"": C-H-I-D-E -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E? But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D? So not.

   We need E at position 4? So the word must have the fourth letter as E? So in ""CHIEF"", it is: C (1), H (2), I (3), E (4), F (5) -> that matches.

   Another possibility: ""CIVET"": C-I-V-E-T -> but T is excluded? So not.

   ""CIG E ?"" -> ""CIGUE""? Not common? Or ""CIGAR"" has A and R? Excluded? Not.

   ""CINE"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

   ""CIPES""? Not common? 

   ""CIRE"": not 5.

   ""CITED"": has T? Excluded? Not.

   So ""CHIEF"" seems a strong candidate? 

   But let's check the letters: H, I, F? All are in the available set? Yes.

   Also, we haven't tested H, I, F? So we can get new information.

   But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But now we know E is at position 4? So that E at position 5 was a mistake? But the word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""CHIEF"", position 5 is F? So that's fine.

   Also, we must ensure that the word doesn't have any excluded letters? ""CHIEF"" has C, H, I, E, F? None of the excluded letters? So it's valid.

   Are there other possibilities? 

   Another word: ""CHIDE""? But we need E at position 4? ""CHIDE"" is C-H-I-D-E? Then position 4 is D? And position 5 is E? But we know E must be at position 4? So not? Because in ""CHIDE"", E is at position 5? But we know from guess1 that E is not at position 5? Because when we guessed E at position 5 in ""crane"", it was marked as present but wrong position? So E cannot be at position 5? Therefore, in the secret word, E is at position 4? So ""CHIDE"" would have E at position 5? Which is not allowed? So invalid.

   Similarly, ""CIVET"": C-I-V-E-T? Position 4 is E? Position 5 is T? But T is excluded? So not.

   ""CREEK"": C-R-E-E-K? R excluded? And E at position 3? Not 4? So not.

   ""CHEVY"": C-H-E-V-Y? Position 3 is E? Not 4? So not.

   So ""CHIEF"" seems to be a good candidate? 

   But what about ""CHIEF""? It fits: C _ _ E _ with H at2, I at3, F at5? And all letters available.

   ""CYKES""? Not common? 

   ""CYMAS""? Not common?
