Hmm, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

Considering common Wordle strategies, the best opening words typically contain frequent letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" comes to mind - it's a popular choice because ""C,"" ""R,"" ""A,"" ""N,"" and ""E"" are all among the most common letters in English 5-letter words. 

""CRANE"" addresses several key points:
- It contains three vowels (A E) which is important since most words need vowels
- The consonants R and N are highly frequent
- It avoids repeating letters which gives maximum coverage
- Letters like E and A appear in many word positions

I recall that statistical analysis shows starting words with R, S, T, L, N, E often perform well. Alternative options like ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" might be slightly better in letter frequency, but ""CRANE"" strikes a great balance between theory and actual gameplay. 

This choice should give me good positional information about the secret word regardless of what the feedback reveals. The letters cover common patterns - for example, E often appears at the end, R in the middle, etc.

The user seems familiar with Wordle rules given the explanation, so I don't need to re-explain the feedback symbols. They're probably expecting a strong strategic opener. 

Okay, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it mathematically has high probability of hitting at least one or two correct letters or positions. After this, I can refine based on feedback.
</think>
Choosing the first guess strategically: A strong starting word should include common letters to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers frequent letters with good positional distribution
- No repeated letters → maximizes coverage of 5 distinct characters

This guess should reveal which letters are present and their approximate positions through the feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""crane"" it is the third letter).
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
- The letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'A' as the third letter.
- Must contain 'R' but not in the second position.
- Cannot contain 'C', 'N', or 'E'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long and is a valid English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the known correct letter 'A' in the third position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the second position (since it was misplaced there in the first guess).
3. Avoid using the letters 'C', 'N', and 'E'.
4. Use other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

We can consider the positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be 'C' (excluded) and we know it's not 'R' because if it were, then in the first guess the 'R' in the second position would have been a dash (meaning present but wrong position) but that doesn't tell us about position 1. Actually, we don't know about position 1 for 'R' yet. However, we know that 'R' is in the word but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We should try to put 'R' in a different position (like 1, 4, or 5) to test.

Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to choose a word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes 'R' in a new position (not position 2).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let's brainstorm some words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ A _ _
- With 'R' in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Without C, N, E.

Possible words:
- If we put 'R' at the start: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RATAL"" (not common), ""RABAT"" (proper noun?), ""RADAR"" (has two 'A's? but we only know one A in position 3) -> but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we can't rule out duplicates. But note: ""radar"" has two 'A's and two 'R's. We know one 'A' is in position 3 and one 'R' is present. But we don't know if there are duplicates. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? But if we use a word with duplicate letters, we might get multiple feedbacks. However, since we are limited by the excluded letters, we might have to.

But note: we must avoid C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words with 'A' in the third position and including 'R' and without C, N, E.

Some ideas:
- ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""PARTY"", the third letter is R, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try:
- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y -> but the third letter is R? No: 
  - B (1), A (2), R (3) -> but we need A at position 3? Actually, in ""BARMY"", the A is at position 2. We need the A at position 3.

So the pattern is: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

We need to fill:
- letter1: any letter except C, N, E and we know it can be R? But we don't know if R is in the word only once. We know R is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since it's not 2 and we have position 3 as A).

Let me try to put R in position 1: 
  - R _ A _ _
  - Words: ""RABAT"" (proper?), ""RADAR"" (R at 1 and 5, A at 2 and 4? but we need A at 3) -> no, in ""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

We need the third letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

So for R at position 1: 
  - R [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Possible words: 
  - ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O is at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. This avoids C, N, E. And we haven't tried O, S, T. This seems good.

But note: we have to consider that the letter2 in the first guess was R and it was a dash (meaning R is in the word but not at position2). In ""ROAST"", the R is at position1, which is a new position. Also, we are testing O, S, T.

Another possibility: ""RALLY"": R A L L Y -> but then the third letter is L? No: R(1), A(2), L(3) -> but we need A at position3? So that doesn't work.

We must have A at position3. So the second letter can be any letter (except the excluded ones and we know it's not R because if it were R, then in the first guess we had R at position2 and it was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2, so the second letter cannot be R). Actually, we don't know if the second letter is R or not? The feedback for the first guess: the R at position2 was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2. Therefore, the second letter in the secret word is not R. So in our new word, we can put any letter at position2 except R and the excluded letters (C, N, E).

So for ""ROAST"": 
  - Position1: R (we are testing if R is at position1)
  - Position2: O (a new letter)
  - Position3: A (correct, we know)
  - Position4: S (new)
  - Position5: T (new)

This seems a good candidate.

But what if R is not at position1? Then we are using R at position1 and it might be wrong. However, if R is not at position1, then the feedback for R in ""ROAST"" would be a dash (if R is in the word but not at position1) or an x (if R is not at position1 and we already know R is in the word, so it must be a dash). Actually, we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position1 and the secret word has R at position4 or 5, then the feedback for R at position1 would be a dash (because it's present but not in the correct position). And if the secret word has R at position1, then we get a check.

So either way, we get information about the position of R.

Alternatively, we could put R at position4 or 5.

For example, if we put R at position4: 
  - Pattern: _ _ A R _
  - Words: ""STARL"" (not common), ""CHARM"" (has C and we excluded C) -> not allowed, ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but then the third letter is R? No: P(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

We need the third letter to be A. So for R at position4: 
  - [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Words: ""LARVA"": L A R V A -> but the third letter is R? No: L(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

Actually, the pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we want [letter4] to be R.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]

Examples: 
  - ""GUARD"": G U A R D -> but U is at position2, A at3, R at4, D at5. This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tried G, U, D.
  - ""BOARD"": B O A R D -> similar, but O at position2.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

However, ""ROAST"" uses more common letters and might be better.

Another word: ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> but the third letter is A, and then I at4 and R at5? Actually: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we are testing F, L, I.

But ""ROAST"" is more common and uses very common letters (O, S, T).

We could also consider ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> but then the third letter is A? Actually: T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). But wait, we are putting R at position2? But we know from the first guess that R is not at position2. So if we put R at position2 again, we know it's wrong. That would be a waste because we already know R is not at position2. So we should avoid putting R at position2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should not put R at position2.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because it puts R at position2.

Similarly, we must avoid position2 for R.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can have R at position1, 4, or 5.

Now, comparing:
- ""ROAST"": R at1, O at2, A at3, S at4, T at5 -> tests R at1 and also O, S, T.
- ""GUARD"": G at1, U at2, A at3, R at4, D at5 -> tests R at4 and G, U, D.
- ""FLAIR"": F at1, L at2, A at3, I at4, R at5 -> tests R at5 and F, L, I.

We want to maximize information. Since we have only one correct letter (A) and one misplaced letter (R), we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

""ROAST"" uses O, S, T which are very common.

""GUARD"" uses G, U, D which are less common.

""FLAIR"" uses F, L, I (L and I are common, F is less common).

So ""ROAST"" seems best.

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ROAST"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""ROARS"" -> but that has two R's and two S's? And the third letter is A? R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we are using R twice. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. If we use two R's, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback for the second R might be x. But that's acceptable. However, we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid C, N, E. ""ROARS"" is valid, but it uses S at the end and we might get less information because of duplicate R.

I think ""ROAST"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".

But wait: what if the secret word has O, S, or T? We will get information about that.

So the next guess: ""roast""

Let me write it in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(x): 'C' is not in the word.
- R(-): 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓): 'A' is correct and in position 3.
- N(x): 'N' is not in the word.
- E(x): 'E' is not in the word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has 'A' as the third letter (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
- 'R' is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are excluded.

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' in position 3 and 'R' in a new position (1, 4, or 5).
- Avoid 'C', 'N', 'E'.
- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information.

""ROAST"" is chosen because:
- It places 'R' in position 1 (testing a new position for 'R').
- It keeps 'A' in position 3.
- It introduces three new common letters: 'O', 'S', 'T'.
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundancy.
- It fits the pattern `R _ A _ _` and avoids excluded letters.

<guess>roast</guess>",roast,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""crane"" it is the third letter).
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
- The letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'A' as the third letter.
- Must contain 'R' but not in the second position.
- Cannot contain 'C', 'N', or 'E'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long and is a valid English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the known correct letter 'A' in the third position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the second position (since it was misplaced there in the first guess).
3. Avoid using the letters 'C', 'N', and 'E'.
4. Use other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

We can consider the positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be 'C' (excluded) and we know it's not 'R' because if it were, then in the first guess the 'R' in the second position would have been a dash (meaning present but wrong position) but that doesn't tell us about position 1. Actually, we don't know about position 1 for 'R' yet. However, we know that 'R' is in the word but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We should try to put 'R' in a different position (like 1, 4, or 5) to test.

Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to choose a word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes 'R' in a new position (not position 2).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let's brainstorm some words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ A _ _
- With 'R' in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Without C, N, E.

Possible words:
- If we put 'R' at the start: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RATAL"" (not common), ""RABAT"" (proper noun?), ""RADAR"" (has two 'A's? but we only know one A in position 3) -> but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we can't rule out duplicates. But note: ""radar"" has two 'A's and two 'R's. We know one 'A' is in position 3 and one 'R' is present. But we don't know if there are duplicates. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? But if we use a word with duplicate letters, we might get multiple feedbacks. However, since we are limited by the excluded letters, we might have to.

But note: we must avoid C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words with 'A' in the third position and including 'R' and without C, N, E.

Some ideas:
- ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""PARTY"", the third letter is R, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try:
- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y -> but the third letter is R? No: 
  - B (1), A (2), R (3) -> but we need A at position 3? Actually, in ""BARMY"", the A is at position 2. We need the A at position 3.

So the pattern is: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

We need to fill:
- letter1: any letter except C, N, E and we know it can be R? But we don't know if R is in the word only once. We know R is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since it's not 2 and we have position 3 as A).

Let me try to put R in position 1: 
  - R _ A _ _
  - Words: ""RABAT"" (proper?), ""RADAR"" (R at 1 and 5, A at 2 and 4? but we need A at 3) -> no, in ""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

We need the third letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

So for R at position 1: 
  - R [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Possible words: 
  - ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O is at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. This avoids C, N, E. And we haven't tried O, S, T. This seems good.

But note: we have to consider that the letter2 in the first guess was R and it was a dash (meaning R is in the word but not at position2). In ""ROAST"", the R is at position1, which is a new position. Also, we are testing O, S, T.

Another possibility: ""RALLY"": R A L L Y -> but then the third letter is L? No: R(1), A(2), L(3) -> but we need A at position3? So that doesn't work.

We must have A at position3. So the second letter can be any letter (except the excluded ones and we know it's not R because if it were R, then in the first guess we had R at position2 and it was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2, so the second letter cannot be R). Actually, we don't know if the second letter is R or not? The feedback for the first guess: the R at position2 was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2. Therefore, the second letter in the secret word is not R. So in our new word, we can put any letter at position2 except R and the excluded letters (C, N, E).

So for ""ROAST"": 
  - Position1: R (we are testing if R is at position1)
  - Position2: O (a new letter)
  - Position3: A (correct, we know)
  - Position4: S (new)
  - Position5: T (new)

This seems a good candidate.

But what if R is not at position1? Then we are using R at position1 and it might be wrong. However, if R is not at position1, then the feedback for R in ""ROAST"" would be a dash (if R is in the word but not at position1) or an x (if R is not at position1 and we already know R is in the word, so it must be a dash). Actually, we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position1 and the secret word has R at position4 or 5, then the feedback for R at position1 would be a dash (because it's present but not in the correct position). And if the secret word has R at position1, then we get a check.

So either way, we get information about the position of R.

Alternatively, we could put R at position4 or 5.

For example, if we put R at position4: 
  - Pattern: _ _ A R _
  - Words: ""STARL"" (not common), ""CHARM"" (has C and we excluded C) -> not allowed, ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but then the third letter is R? No: P(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

We need the third letter to be A. So for R at position4: 
  - [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Words: ""LARVA"": L A R V A -> but the third letter is R? No: L(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

Actually, the pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we want [letter4] to be R.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]

Examples: 
  - ""GUARD"": G U A R D -> but U is at position2, A at3, R at4, D at5. This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tried G, U, D.
  - ""BOARD"": B O A R D -> similar, but O at position2.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

However, ""ROAST"" uses more common letters and might be better.

Another word: ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> but the third letter is A, and then I at4 and R at5? Actually: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we are testing F, L, I.

But ""ROAST"" is more common and uses very common letters (O, S, T).

We could also consider ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> but then the third letter is A? Actually: T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). But wait, we are putting R at position2? But we know from the first guess that R is not at position2. So if we put R at position2 again, we know it's wrong. That would be a waste because we already know R is not at position2. So we should avoid putting R at position2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should not put R at position2.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because it puts R at position2.

Similarly, we must avoid position2 for R.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can have R at position1, 4, or 5.

Now, comparing:
- ""ROAST"": R at1, O at2, A at3, S at4, T at5 -> tests R at1 and also O, S, T.
- ""GUARD"": G at1, U at2, A at3, R at4, D at5 -> tests R at4 and G, U, D.
- ""FLAIR"": F at1, L at2, A at3, I at4, R at5 -> tests R at5 and F, L, I.

We want to maximize information. Since we have only one correct letter (A) and one misplaced letter (R), we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

""ROAST"" uses O, S, T which are very common.

""GUARD"" uses G, U, D which are less common.

""FLAIR"" uses F, L, I (L and I are common, F is less common).

So ""ROAST"" seems best.

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ROAST"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""ROARS"" -> but that has two R's and two S's? And the third letter is A? R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we are using R twice. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. If we use two R's, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback for the second R might be x. But that's acceptable. However, we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid C, N, E. ""ROARS"" is valid, but it uses S at the end and we might get less information because of duplicate R.

I think ""ROAST"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".

But wait: what if the secret word has O, S, or T? We will get information about that.

So the next guess: ""roast""

Let me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(x): 'C' is not in the word.
- R(-): 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓): 'A' is correct and in position 3.
- N(x): 'N' is not in the word.
- E(x): 'E' is not in the word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has 'A' as the third letter (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
- 'R' is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are excluded.

For the next guess:
- Must include 'A' in position 3 and 'R' in a new position (1, 4, or 5).
- Avoid 'C', 'N', 'E'.
- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information.

""ROAST"" is chosen because:
- It places 'R' in position 1 (testing a new position for 'R').
- It keeps 'A' in position 3.
- It introduces three new common letters: 'O', 'S', 'T'.
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundancy.
- It fits the pattern `R _ A _ _` and avoids excluded letters.",Guess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Hmm, the user wants me to make the first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since it's the first guess, I need to choose a strategic starting word that maximizes information gain. 

Considering common Wordle strategies, the best opening words typically contain frequent letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" comes to mind - it's a popular choice because ""C,"" ""R,"" ""A,"" ""N,"" and ""E"" are all among the most common letters in English 5-letter words. 

""CRANE"" addresses several key points:
- It contains three vowels (A E) which is important since most words need vowels
- The consonants R and N are highly frequent
- It avoids repeating letters which gives maximum coverage
- Letters like E and A appear in many word positions

I recall that statistical analysis shows starting words with R, S, T, L, N, E often perform well. Alternative options like ""SLATE"" or ""ROATE"" might be slightly better in letter frequency, but ""CRANE"" strikes a great balance between theory and actual gameplay. 

This choice should give me good positional information about the secret word regardless of what the feedback reveals. The letters cover common patterns - for example, E often appears at the end, R in the middle, etc.

The user seems familiar with Wordle rules given the explanation, so I don't need to re-explain the feedback symbols. They're probably expecting a strong strategic opener. 

Okay, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it mathematically has high probability of hitting at least one or two correct letters or positions. After this, I can refine based on feedback.Choosing the first guess strategically: A strong starting word should include common letters to maximize information gain. ""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers frequent letters with good positional distribution
- No repeated letters → maximizes coverage of 5 distinct characters

This guess should reveal which letters are present and their approximate positions through the feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The letter 'A' is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""crane"" it is the third letter).
- The letter 'R' is in the word but not in the second position (where we placed it in ""crane"").
- The letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have 'A' as the third letter.
- Must contain 'R' but not in the second position.
- Cannot contain 'C', 'N', or 'E'.

We also know that the word is 5 letters long and is a valid English word.

For our next guess, we should:
1. Include the known correct letter 'A' in the third position.
2. Include the letter 'R' but not in the second position (since it was misplaced there in the first guess).
3. Avoid using the letters 'C', 'N', and 'E'.
4. Use other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

We can consider the positions:
- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be 'C' (excluded) and we know it's not 'R' because if it were, then in the first guess the 'R' in the second position would have been a dash (meaning present but wrong position) but that doesn't tell us about position 1. Actually, we don't know about position 1 for 'R' yet. However, we know that 'R' is in the word but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We should try to put 'R' in a different position (like 1, 4, or 5) to test.

Also, we need to avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to choose a word that:
- Has 'A' in the third position.
- Includes 'R' in a new position (not position 2).
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let's brainstorm some words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ A _ _
- With 'R' in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Without C, N, E.

Possible words:
- If we put 'R' at the start: R _ A _ _
  - Examples: ""RATAL"" (not common), ""RABAT"" (proper noun?), ""RADAR"" (has two 'A's? but we only know one A in position 3) -> but we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we can't rule out duplicates. But note: ""radar"" has two 'A's and two 'R's. We know one 'A' is in position 3 and one 'R' is present. But we don't know if there are duplicates. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? But if we use a word with duplicate letters, we might get multiple feedbacks. However, since we are limited by the excluded letters, we might have to.

But note: we must avoid C, N, E.

Let me try to think of words with 'A' in the third position and including 'R' and without C, N, E.

Some ideas:
- ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""PARTY"", the third letter is R, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try:
- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y -> but the third letter is R? No: 
  - B (1), A (2), R (3) -> but we need A at position 3? Actually, in ""BARMY"", the A is at position 2. We need the A at position 3.

So the pattern is: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

We need to fill:
- letter1: any letter except C, N, E and we know it can be R? But we don't know if R is in the word only once. We know R is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since it's not 2 and we have position 3 as A).

Let me try to put R in position 1: 
  - R _ A _ _
  - Words: ""RABAT"" (proper?), ""RADAR"" (R at 1 and 5, A at 2 and 4? but we need A at 3) -> no, in ""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

We need the third letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

So for R at position 1: 
  - R [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Possible words: 
  - ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O is at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. This avoids C, N, E. And we haven't tried O, S, T. This seems good.

But note: we have to consider that the letter2 in the first guess was R and it was a dash (meaning R is in the word but not at position2). In ""ROAST"", the R is at position1, which is a new position. Also, we are testing O, S, T.

Another possibility: ""RALLY"": R A L L Y -> but then the third letter is L? No: R(1), A(2), L(3) -> but we need A at position3? So that doesn't work.

We must have A at position3. So the second letter can be any letter (except the excluded ones and we know it's not R because if it were R, then in the first guess we had R at position2 and it was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2, so the second letter cannot be R). Actually, we don't know if the second letter is R or not? The feedback for the first guess: the R at position2 was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2. Therefore, the second letter in the secret word is not R. So in our new word, we can put any letter at position2 except R and the excluded letters (C, N, E).

So for ""ROAST"": 
  - Position1: R (we are testing if R is at position1)
  - Position2: O (a new letter)
  - Position3: A (correct, we know)
  - Position4: S (new)
  - Position5: T (new)

This seems a good candidate.

But what if R is not at position1? Then we are using R at position1 and it might be wrong. However, if R is not at position1, then the feedback for R in ""ROAST"" would be a dash (if R is in the word but not at position1) or an x (if R is not at position1 and we already know R is in the word, so it must be a dash). Actually, we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position1 and the secret word has R at position4 or 5, then the feedback for R at position1 would be a dash (because it's present but not in the correct position). And if the secret word has R at position1, then we get a check.

So either way, we get information about the position of R.

Alternatively, we could put R at position4 or 5.

For example, if we put R at position4: 
  - Pattern: _ _ A R _
  - Words: ""STARL"" (not common), ""CHARM"" (has C and we excluded C) -> not allowed, ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but then the third letter is R? No: P(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

We need the third letter to be A. So for R at position4: 
  - [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]
  - Without C, N, E.

Words: ""LARVA"": L A R V A -> but the third letter is R? No: L(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.

Actually, the pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we want [letter4] to be R.

So: [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]

Examples: 
  - ""GUARD"": G U A R D -> but U is at position2, A at3, R at4, D at5. This avoids C, N, E. But we haven't tried G, U, D.
  - ""BOARD"": B O A R D -> similar, but O at position2.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

However, ""ROAST"" uses more common letters and might be better.

Another word: ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> but the third letter is A, and then I at4 and R at5? Actually: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we are testing F, L, I.

But ""ROAST"" is more common and uses very common letters (O, S, T).

We could also consider ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> but then the third letter is A? Actually: T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). But wait, we are putting R at position2? But we know from the first guess that R is not at position2. So if we put R at position2 again, we know it's wrong. That would be a waste because we already know R is not at position2. So we should avoid putting R at position2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should not put R at position2.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because it puts R at position2.

Similarly, we must avoid position2 for R.

Therefore, for the pattern, we can have R at position1, 4, or 5.

Now, comparing:
- ""ROAST"": R at1, O at2, A at3, S at4, T at5 -> tests R at1 and also O, S, T.
- ""GUARD"": G at1, U at2, A at3, R at4, D at5 -> tests R at4 and G, U, D.
- ""FLAIR"": F at1, L at2, A at3, I at4, R at5 -> tests R at5 and F, L, I.

We want to maximize information. Since we have only one correct letter (A) and one misplaced letter (R), we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

""ROAST"" uses O, S, T which are very common.

""GUARD"" uses G, U, D which are less common.

""FLAIR"" uses F, L, I (L and I are common, F is less common).

So ""ROAST"" seems best.

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ROAST"" is a valid word.

Another candidate: ""ROARS"" -> but that has two R's and two S's? And the third letter is A? R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we are using R twice. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. If we use two R's, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback for the second R might be x. But that's acceptable. However, we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid C, N, E. ""ROARS"" is valid, but it uses S at the end and we might get less information because of duplicate R.

I think ""ROAST"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Therefore, I choose ""ROAST"".

But wait: what if the secret word has O, S, or T? We will get information about that.

So the next guess: ""roast""

Let me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(x): 'C' is not in the word.
- R(-): 'R' is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓): 'A' is correct and in position 3.
- N(x): 'N' is not in the word.
- E(x): 'E' is not in the word.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has 'A' as the third letter (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
- 'R' is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters 'C', 'N', and 'E' are excluded.

However, we know that \'R\' is in the word but not in position 2, so it could be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nWe should try to put \'R\' in a different position (like 1, 4, or 5) to test.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid the excluded letters: C, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to choose a word that:\n- Has \'A\' in the third position.\n- Includes \'R\' in a new position (not position 2).\n- Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words that fit:\n- The pattern: _ _ A _ _\n- With \'R\' in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- Without C, N, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- If we put \'R\' at the start: R _ A _ _\n  - Examples: ""RATAL"" (not common), ""RABAT"" (proper noun?), ""RADAR"" (has two \'A\'s? but we only know one A in position 3) -> but we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so we can\'t rule out duplicates. But note: ""radar"" has two \'A\'s and two \'R\'s. We know one \'A\' is in position 3 and one \'R\' is present. But we don\'t know if there are duplicates. We should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information? But if we use a word with duplicate letters, we might get multiple feedbacks. However, since we are limited by the excluded letters, we might have to.\n\nBut note: we must avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet me try to think of words with \'A\' in the third position and including \'R\' and without C, N, E.\n\nSome ideas:\n- ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""PARTY"", the third letter is R, not A. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nTry:\n- ""BARMY"": B A R M Y -> but the third letter is R? No: \n  - B (1), A (2), R (3) -> but we need A at position 3? Actually, in ""BARMY"", the A is at position 2. We need the A at position 3.\n\nSo the pattern is: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\nWe need to fill:\n- letter1: any letter except C, N, E and we know it can be R? But we don\'t know if R is in the word only once. We know R is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since it\'s not 2 and we have position 3 as A).\n\nLet me try to put R in position 1: \n  - R _ A _ _\n  - Words: ""RABAT"" (proper?), ""RADAR"" (R at 1 and 5, A at 2 and 4? but we need A at 3) -> no, in ""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A. So the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n\nSo for R at position 1: \n  - R [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]\n  - Without C, N, E.\n\nPossible words: \n  - ""ROAST"": R O A S T -> but O is at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5. This avoids C, N, E. And we haven\'t tried O, S, T. This seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the letter2 in the first guess was R and it was a dash (meaning R is in the word but not at position2). In ""ROAST"", the R is at position1, which is a new position. Also, we are testing O, S, T.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RALLY"": R A L L Y -> but then the third letter is L? No: R(1), A(2), L(3) -> but we need A at position3? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have A at position3. So the second letter can be any letter (except the excluded ones and we know it\'s not R because if it were R, then in the first guess we had R at position2 and it was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2, so the second letter cannot be R). Actually, we don\'t know if the second letter is R or not? The feedback for the first guess: the R at position2 was a dash, meaning that R is in the word but not at position2. Therefore, the second letter in the secret word is not R. So in our new word, we can put any letter at position2 except R and the excluded letters (C, N, E).\n\nSo for ""ROAST"": \n  - Position1: R (we are testing if R is at position1)\n  - Position2: O (a new letter)\n  - Position3: A (correct, we know)\n  - Position4: S (new)\n  - Position5: T (new)\n\nThis seems a good candidate.\n\nBut what if R is not at position1? Then we are using R at position1 and it might be wrong. However, if R is not at position1, then the feedback for R in ""ROAST"" would be a dash (if R is in the word but not at position1) or an x (if R is not at position1 and we already know R is in the word, so it must be a dash). Actually, we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position1 and the secret word has R at position4 or 5, then the feedback for R at position1 would be a dash (because it\'s present but not in the correct position). And if the secret word has R at position1, then we get a check.\n\nSo either way, we get information about the position of R.\n\nAlternatively, we could put R at position4 or 5.\n\nFor example, if we put R at position4: \n  - Pattern: _ _ A R _\n  - Words: ""STARL"" (not common), ""CHARM"" (has C and we excluded C) -> not allowed, ""PARTY"": P A R T Y -> but then the third letter is R? No: P(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A. So for R at position4: \n  - [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]\n  - Without C, N, E.\n\nWords: ""LARVA"": L A R V A -> but the third letter is R? No: L(1), A(2), R(3) -> not A at position3.\n\nActually, the pattern must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we want [letter4] to be R.\n\nSo: [letter1] [letter2] A R [letter5]\n\nExamples: \n  - ""GUARD"": G U A R D -> but U is at position2, A at3, R at4, D at5. This avoids C, N, E. But we haven\'t tried G, U, D.\n  - ""BOARD"": B O A R D -> similar, but O at position2.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.\n\nHowever, ""ROAST"" uses more common letters and might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> but the third letter is A, and then I at4 and R at5? Actually: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). This avoids C, N, E. But we are testing F, L, I.\n\nBut ""ROAST"" is more common and uses very common letters (O, S, T).\n\nWe could also consider ""TRAIL"": T R A I L -> but then the third letter is A? Actually: T(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), L(5). But wait, we are putting R at position2? But we know from the first guess that R is not at position2. So if we put R at position2 again, we know it\'s wrong. That would be a waste because we already know R is not at position2. So we should avoid putting R at position2.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should not put R at position2.\n\nSo ""TRAIL"" is invalid because it puts R at position2.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid position2 for R.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern, we can have R at position1, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, comparing:\n- ""ROAST"": R at1, O at2, A at3, S at4, T at5 -> tests R at1 and also O, S, T.\n- ""GUARD"": G at1, U at2, A at3, R at4, D at5 -> tests R at4 and G, U, D.\n- ""FLAIR"": F at1, L at2, A at3, I at4, R at5 -> tests R at5 and F, L, I.\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we have only one correct letter (A) and one misplaced letter (R), we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n""ROAST"" uses O, S, T which are very common.\n\n""GUARD"" uses G, U, D which are less common.\n\n""FLAIR"" uses F, L, I (L and I are common, F is less common).\n\nSo ""ROAST"" seems best.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""ROAST"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ROARS"" -> but that has two R\'s and two S\'s? And the third letter is A? R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we are using R twice. We don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. If we use two R\'s, then if the secret word has only one R, the feedback for the second R might be x. But that\'s acceptable. However, we are limited by the fact that we have to avoid C, N, E. ""ROARS"" is valid, but it uses S at the end and we might get less information because of duplicate R.\n\nI think ""ROAST"" is better because it has all distinct letters.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ROAST"".\n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has O, S, or T? We will get information about that.\n\nSo the next guess: ""roast""\n\nLet me write it in the required format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C(x): \'C\' is not in the word.\n- R(-): \'R\' is in the word but not in position 2.\n- A(✓): \'A\' is correct and in position 3.\n- N(x): \'N\' is not in the word.\n- E(x): \'E\' is not in the word.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has \'A\' as the third letter (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).\n- \'R\' is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5).\n- Letters \'C\', \'N\', and \'E\' are excluded.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include \'A\' in position 3 and \'R\' in a new position (1, 4, or 5).\n- Avoid \'C\', \'N\', \'E\'.\n- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, O) to maximize information.\n\n""ROAST"" is chosen because:\n- It places \'R\' in position 1 (testing a new position for \'R\').\n- It keeps \'A\' in position 3.\n- It introduces three new common letters: \'O\', \'S\', \'T\'.\n- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundancy.\n- It fits the pattern `R _ A _ _` and avoids excluded letters.\n\n<guess>roast</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → so R is present, but not in position 2
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓) → so the third letter is A
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""roast""
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → we already knew R is present, but now we see it's not in position 1 (because we put it in position 1 and got a dash)
- O: not in word (x) → so O is absent
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓) → confirmed again
- S: not in word (x) → so S is absent
- T: in word but wrong position (-) → so T is present, but not in position 5

So now we know:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. The word contains the letters: R and T (and we know A is in position 3)
3. R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from guess1: not in 2; from guess2: not in 1; and position 3 is A, so R must be in position 4 or 5)
4. T is present but not in position 5 (from guess2: we put T in position 5 and got a dash, so T is in the word but not at the end)
5. Excluded letters: C, N, E, O, S (from both guesses: C, N, E, O, S are not in the word)

We also have to consider that we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.

But note: we know R and T are in the word, so we must include them. Also, we have two positions for R: 4 or 5, and T must be in one of the positions 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is A).

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, N, E, O, S, and also cannot be R (because we tried R in position1 and it was wrong) → so position1 must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Position 2: unknown, cannot be C, N, E, O, S, and also cannot be R (from guess1) → so same as position1.

Position 3: A (fixed)

Position 4: could be R or T or another letter? But we know R must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1,2,4 (but not 5). Also, position4 cannot be any excluded letter.

Position 5: could be R (if R is in 5) or another letter, but not T (because T is not in 5) and not excluded.

We have two letters that must be placed: R and T.

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5 (since 1,2,3 are impossible for R).

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 4 (since 5 is impossible and 3 is A).

But note: if R is in position 4, then T cannot be in position 4. Similarly, if R is in position 5, then T can be in 1,2,4.

Also, the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we know at least two more letters (R and T) and one is A, so we need two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, E, N, O, S. So available letters: all others.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Now, let's consider the two cases for R:

Case 1: R in position 4.
Then the pattern is: _ _ A R _
And T must be in position 1 or 2 (because if T were in position 4, but that's taken by R, and position 5 is open but T cannot be in 5). So T in 1 or 2.

So pattern: T _ A R _  or _ T A R _

But we also have to fill the remaining position (if T is in 1, then position2 and position5 are open; if T is in 2, then position1 and position5 are open).

Case 2: R in position 5.
Then the pattern is: _ _ A _ R
And T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

So pattern: T _ A _ R, or _ T A _ R, or _ _ A T R

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to think of words that fit.

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we want a guess that can test between these cases and use common letters.

We have not used many vowels. The only vowel we have is A (and we know it's in position3). We have excluded E and O. So the remaining vowels are I, U, and sometimes Y.

We should consider including a vowel to get more information.

But we also have to include R and T? Not necessarily in the next guess, but we know they are in the word so we might as well use them to get positional information.

However, we have two letters to place and we don't know where, so we might design a guess that can help us locate both.

Let me list possible words for each case to see what is possible.

First, case 1: R in position 4 -> pattern _ _ A R _

With T in position 1: T _ A R _
Possible words: 
- TYPER? But E is excluded.
- TAPIR? But I is allowed, and P is not excluded. T A P I R -> but wait, position3 is A, so if we have T in1, then position2 must be a letter, then A in3, R in4, and then position5. So for T _ A R _, the word must be T?A R?.

Examples: 
- ""TABOR"" -> but O is excluded.
- ""TAMAR"" -> not a word? 
- ""TAPIR"" -> T(1) A(2) P(3) I(4) R(5) -> but we need A in position3? Here A is in position2, so not matching pattern.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we are saying letter4 is R and letter1 is T? So: T [letter2] A R [letter5]

So words: 
- ""TAROT"" -> T A R O T -> but O is excluded and also the pattern: T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) T(5) -> but we need A in position3? No, this has A in position2. We need the third letter to be A, so it must be: T [consonant?] A R [vowel?]

Examples: 
- ""THAR ?"" -> not a word.
- ""TIARA"" -> T I A R A -> T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. But we have two A's? The feedback for the first guess had A correct in position3, but it didn't say anything about other A's. So it's possible. But we have to check if A is allowed again? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are duplicate letters. So ""tiara"" is a word. But we have excluded letters? T, I, A, R, A. A is allowed (we know it's in), but we have to check if any excluded: I is not excluded, T is in the word, R is in the word. Excluded are C, E, N, O, S. So ""tiara"" is possible? But let's see: T is in position1, but we know T is in the word and not in position5, but in ""tiara"", T is in position1 and also in position5? The feedback for T in guess2 was a dash in position5, meaning T is in the word but not in position5. But if the word is ""tiara"", then T is in position1 and not in position5, which is consistent. However, the dash for T in guess2 was because we put T in position5 and it was wrong, but T is in the word (at position1). So that's fine. But in ""tiara"", the letter at position5 is A, not T. So T is only at position1. So that's okay.

But we have two A's: one at position3 and one at position5. Is that allowed? Yes, Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate A's. It might.

Another word: ""TALAR"" -> T A L A R? But then pattern: T(1) A(2) L(3) A(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, so not.

We need position3 to be A, so the word must be: T [letter2] A R [letter5]. So letter2 and letter5 to be filled.

Possible: 
- ""TIBAR"" ? not a word.
- ""TIGAR"" ? not common.
- ""TIMAR"" ? not a word.
- ""TITAR"" ? no.

""TIARA"" is one: T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5)

Another: ""TAROK"" ? but O excluded.

""TARED"" ? E excluded.

""TARAF"" ? not common, but F is allowed.

But let's not get stuck. We also have the case with T in position2.

Case1: R in position4, T in position2: pattern _ T A R _

So [letter1] T A R [letter5]

Words:
- ""STAR ?"" but S excluded.
- ""UTARA"" ? U T A R A -> U(1) T(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. U is a vowel, not excluded.

""UTARA"" is a place name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually not, so let's stick to common words.

""ALTAR"" -> A L T A R -> but then position1 is A, but we have A in position3? And also, we have A in position1 and position3? Pattern: A(1) L(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, here it's T. Not matching.

We need: [letter1] T A R [letter5]

So:
- ""STA R"" but S excluded.
- ""PTAR?"" no.
- ""MTAR?"" no.

""ATTAR"" -> A T T A R -> A(1) T(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position3 is T, not A. Not matching.

It's hard to find words for this pattern.

Now case 2: R in position5 -> pattern _ _ A _ R

And T in position1,2, or4.

Subcases:

T in position1: T _ A _ R
Words: 
- ""TAPIR"" -> T A P I R -> T(1) A(2) P(3) I(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, here it's P. Not.
- ""TAMER"" -> E excluded.
- ""TASER"" -> S and E excluded.

We need: T [letter2] A [letter4] R

So: 
- ""TEAR ?"" E excluded.
- ""TIAR?"" -> ""TIARA"" we considered, but that has R in position4, not 5. Here we want R in5.

""TIARA"" has R in4, so not.

""TIGAR"" not a word.

""TILAR"" not.

""TONAR"" O excluded.

Not many.

T in position2: _ T A _ R
Pattern: [letter1] T A [letter4] R

Words:
- ""STA R"" S excluded.
- ""UTAHR"" -> U T A H R -> U(1) T(2) A(3) H(4) R(5) -> this could be ""UTAH"" is a state, but ""UTAHR"" is not a word. 
- ""ALTAR"" -> A L T A R -> A(1) L(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A. Not.

We need position3 to be A, so: [letter1] T A [letter4] R

Examples:
- ""STAR ?"" S excluded.
- ""PTAR?"" no.
- ""METAR"" E excluded.
- ""NOTAR"" O excluded.

""ATTAR"" -> A T T A R -> A(1) T(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

Hard to find.

T in position4: _ _ A T R
Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A T R

Words:
- ""MATER"" -> M A T E R -> E excluded.
- ""CATER"" -> C excluded.
- ""HATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""LATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""WATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""PATAR"" not a word.

But we have to avoid E. So:

- ""BA T R"" -> ""BATAR"" not a word.
- ""DATAR"" not common.
- ""FATAR"" not.
- ""HATAR"" not.
- ""LATAR"" not common.
- ""MATAR"" -> M A T A R -> M(1) A(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

We need position3 to be A, so: [letter1] [letter2] A T R

So the word ends with ""ATR"", like:
- ""BATR"" not.
- ""CATR"" not.
- ""DATR"" not.
- ""EATR"" E excluded.
- ""FATR"" not.
- ""GATR"" not.
- ""HATR"" not.
- ""IATR"" not.
- ""JATR"" not.
- ""KATR"" not.
- ""LATR"" not.
- ""MATR"" not.
- ""NATR"" N excluded.
- ""OATR"" O excluded.
- ""PATR"" not a word, but ""PATRY"" not.
- ""RATR"" not.
- ""SATR"" S excluded.
- ""TATR"" not.
- ""UATR"" not.
- ""VATR"" not.
- ""WATR"" not.
- ""XATR"" not.
- ""YATR"" not.
- ""ZATR"" not.

It seems difficult. Maybe ""AATR"" but not a word.

Perhaps I missed a word. What about ""TAWDR"" not.

Another idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters. For example, in case 1 with R in position4 and T in position1, we have ""TIARA"" which works.

Similarly, for other cases.

But in case 2, with R in position5 and T in position4, we have words like ""ALTAR"" but that has A in position1 and T in position3, not A in position3.

We need to have A in position3.

Let me think of common words with A in position3.

For example, ""LEAST"" but S and E excluded.

""PLANT"" but N excluded.

""TRACK"" C excluded.

""GRAND"" but N excluded.

""BRAND"" N excluded.

""CRANE"" we tried, excluded.

""BRAVE"" E excluded.

""FRAME"" E excluded.

""GRACE"" C and E excluded.

""SHADE"" E excluded.

""STALE"" S and E excluded.

With the excluded letters, it's limited.

Available vowels: I, U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know R and T are in the word.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and contain R and T, and avoid C,E,N,O,S.

For example:

- ""TAWAR"" -> T A W A R -> T(1) A(2) W(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is W, not A. Not.

- ""TIARA"" -> T I A R A -> T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. Letters: T, I, A, R, A. A is duplicated. Excluded letters none. R is in position4.

- ""KARAT"" -> K A R A T -> K(1) A(2) R(3) A(4) T(5) -> position3 is R, not A. Not.

- ""PARAD"" -> P A R A D -> P(1) A(2) R(3) A(4) D(5) -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""MARAS"" S excluded.

- ""VARNA"" N excluded.

- ""HARAM"" -> H A R A M -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""BARRA"" -> B A R R A -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""DARAF"" -> D A R A F -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""FARAD"" E? not, but position3 is R.

It seems ""TIARA"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" but we have R in position1 and position5, and A in position2 and4, but position3 is D, not A.

""PAPAL"" -> P A P A L -> position3 is P, not A.

""LABIA"" -> L A B I A -> position3 is B, not A.

""MANIA"" N excluded.

""RABAT"" but we have R in1, A in2, B in3, A in4, T in5 -> position3 is B, not A.

So ""TIARA"" seems a valid word.

But in ""TIARA"", R is in position4, which is one of the options.

Also, T is in position1, which is consistent with the feedback that T is not in position5.

And A is in position3 and also in position5.

Now, are there other words?

What about ""TRAIT"" -> T R A I T -> T(1) R(2) A(3) I(4) T(5) -> but we know R cannot be in position2 (from guess1 feedback). So invalid.

""TRAIL"" -> same issue, R in position2.

""TRIAD"" -> T R I A D -> T(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) D(5) -> position3 is I, not A.

""TRIAL"" -> T R I A L -> position3 is I, not A.

""TAROT"" -> T A R O T -> O excluded and position3 is R, not A.

""TALAR"" -> T A L A R -> position3 is L, not A.

So ""TIARA"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make a guess, and we can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

Since we have limited information, we might guess a word that has R in position4 or 5 and T in a different position, and uses new letters.

For example, we can try to put R in position5 to see if it's there, and T in position1 or 2.

But from above, it's hard to find words with R in position5 and A in position3.

Another word: ""GUARD"" -> G U A R D -> G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> this has R in position4, not 5.

""GUAR"" is not 5 letters.

""JAZAR"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LAVAR"" not common.

Maybe ""VAPOR"" O excluded.

It seems that having R in position4 is more likely given the word list.

Another common word: ""LARVA"" -> L A R V A -> position3 is R, not A.

""PARTA"" -> P A R T A -> position3 is R, not A.

""ARTAL"" -> A R T A L -> position3 is T, not A.

I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess, but let's see if we can find a word with R in position5.

For example, ""SITAR"" -> S I T A R -> S(1) I(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

""GITAR"" not.

""MITRA"" -> M I T R A -> position3 is T, not A.

""VITRA"" not.

So perhaps there are no common words with A in position3 and R in position5.

Therefore, R is likely in position4.

Similarly, T must be in position1 or 2.

In ""TIARA"", we have T in position1 and I in position2.

We could guess ""TIARA"" directly.

But to be safe, we might guess a word that tests the position of T and R with new letters.

For example, we can guess a word with T in position1, a new letter in position2, A in3, R in4, and a new letter in5.

Like ""TIGAR"" not a word, or ""TIBAR"" not.

""TIMAR"" not.

""TIPAR"" not.

""TIVAR"" not.

""TIARA"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another word: ""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> D(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) Y(5) -> this works! And it avoids excluded letters: D, I, A, R, Y. Y is allowed.

""DIARY"" has A in position3, R in position4, T is not in it? But we know T is in the word. ""DIARY"" does not have T, but we know T is in the word from guess2 feedback (T was a dash, so present). So ""DIARY"" cannot be the word because it lacks T.

Similarly, ""DAIRY"" same thing.

""FAIRY"" has no T.

""HAIRY"" no T.

""LAIRY"" no T.

""MAIRY"" not common.

""PAIRY"" not.

So they don't work because they miss T.

We must include T.

Another word: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> N excluded and position3 is I, not A.

""TASTE"" S and E excluded.

""TAROT"" O excluded.

""TARTY"" -> T A R T Y -> T(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) Y(5) -> position3 is R, not A.

Not.

So back to ""TIARA"", which has T and R and A.

But ""TIARA"" has T in position1, I in2, A in3, R in4, A in5.

We can also consider ""ARIAS"" but S excluded and no T.

Or ""CARAT"" C excluded.

So I think ""TIARA"" is a valid guess.

Perhaps ""RATIO"" but O excluded and R in position1, but we know R is not in position1 (from guess2 feedback: R in position1 was dash, so not there).

In guess2, we had ""roast"" with R in1 and got dash, so R not in1.

So for the secret word, R cannot be in1.

In ""TIARA"", R is in4, which is allowed.

Another possibility: ""BRIAR"" -> B R I A R -> B(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is I, not A, and R in position2 which is not allowed.

Not.

So I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if ""TIARA"" is the secret word.

But we don't know, so we are guessing.

We could guess a word that has T in position2 and R in position4, but we couldn't find one.

Or T in position4 and R in position5, but no words.

So I'll go with ""TIARA"".

But in ""TIARA"", the letter A is duplicated. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A's, but it's possible.

Another word: ""TRAIT"" not possible because of R in2.

""TRACT"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""DRAIN"" N excluded.

I think ""TIARA"" is the best bet.

So next guess: ""tiara""

But let's see if there's a word with T in position2 and R in position4.

For example, ""PTAR?"" no.

""UTARA"" not common.

""ITALY"" -> I T A L Y -> I(1) T(2) A(3) L(4) Y(5) -> this has A in position3, T in position2, but no R. But we need R in the word. ""ITALY"" does not have R, but we know R is in the word. So not.

""FATAL"" no R.

""KAPUT"" O? not, and no R.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""TAWDR"" not a word.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  - This reveals:  
    - ""A"" is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
    - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: roast** → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-)  
  - This reveals:  
    - ""A"" is confirmed again at position 3.  
    - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced in position 1 here).  
    - ""T"" is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - ""O"" and ""S"" are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The word must be `_ _ A _ _` (since ""A"" is fixed at position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**:  
  - ""A"" (position 3), ""R"" (somewhere, but not position 1, 2, or 3), and ""T"" (somewhere, but not position 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible positions for ""R""**: Only positions 4 or 5 remain (since positions 1, 2, and 3 are invalid based on feedback).  
- **Possible positions for ""T""**: Positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid, and position 3 is taken by ""A"").  
- **Constraints**:  
  - ""R"" and ""T"" cannot share the same position.  
  - The word must include two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, E, N, O, S).  

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- Given the feedback, ""R"" is likely in position 4 (as position 5 is less common for ""R"" in 5-letter words with ""A"" at position 3, and no common words fit with ""R"" in position 5 under the constraints).  
- ""T"" is likely in position 1 or 2.  
- ""TIARA"" is a strong candidate because:  
  - It tests ""T"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4.  
  - It includes ""I"" (a common vowel not yet tested) and a second ""A"" (duplicate letters are allowed in Wordle).  
  - It fits the pattern `T _ A R _` and avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If correct, it could solve the word. If not, the feedback will clarify the positions of ""T"" and ""R"" and test new letters (""I"" and the duplicate ""A"").  

### Why ""TIARA""?
- Tests key positions:  
  - Position 1: ""T"" (if correct, confirms ""T"" placement; if misplaced, indicates ""T"" is in position 2 or 4).  
  - Position 4: ""R"" (if correct, confirms ""R"" placement; if misplaced, ""R"" must be in position 5).  
  - Position 2: ""I"" (new vowel, tests for presence).  
  - Position 5: ""A"" (tests for duplicate ""A"").  
- Maximizes information: Uses 3 new letters (I, and duplicate A) while leveraging known constraints.  

<guess>tiara</guess>",tiara,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → so R is present, but not in position 2
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓) → so the third letter is A
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

Guess 2: ""roast""
- R: in word but wrong position (-) → we already knew R is present, but now we see it's not in position 1 (because we put it in position 1 and got a dash)
- O: not in word (x) → so O is absent
- A: correct and in position 3 (✓) → confirmed again
- S: not in word (x) → so S is absent
- T: in word but wrong position (-) → so T is present, but not in position 5

So now we know:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. The word contains the letters: R and T (and we know A is in position 3)
3. R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from guess1: not in 2; from guess2: not in 1; and position 3 is A, so R must be in position 4 or 5)
4. T is present but not in position 5 (from guess2: we put T in position 5 and got a dash, so T is in the word but not at the end)
5. Excluded letters: C, N, E, O, S (from both guesses: C, N, E, O, S are not in the word)

We also have to consider that we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S, T. So the remaining letters are from the alphabet without these.

But note: we know R and T are in the word, so we must include them. Also, we have two positions for R: 4 or 5, and T must be in one of the positions 1,2,4 (but not 5, and 3 is A).

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, N, E, O, S, and also cannot be R (because we tried R in position1 and it was wrong) → so position1 must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Position 2: unknown, cannot be C, N, E, O, S, and also cannot be R (from guess1) → so same as position1.

Position 3: A (fixed)

Position 4: could be R or T or another letter? But we know R must be in 4 or 5, and T must be in 1,2,4 (but not 5). Also, position4 cannot be any excluded letter.

Position 5: could be R (if R is in 5) or another letter, but not T (because T is not in 5) and not excluded.

We have two letters that must be placed: R and T.

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5 (since 1,2,3 are impossible for R).

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 4 (since 5 is impossible and 3 is A).

But note: if R is in position 4, then T cannot be in position 4. Similarly, if R is in position 5, then T can be in 1,2,4.

Also, the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we know at least two more letters (R and T) and one is A, so we need two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, E, N, O, S. So available letters: all others.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Now, let's consider the two cases for R:

Case 1: R in position 4.
Then the pattern is: _ _ A R _
And T must be in position 1 or 2 (because if T were in position 4, but that's taken by R, and position 5 is open but T cannot be in 5). So T in 1 or 2.

So pattern: T _ A R _  or _ T A R _

But we also have to fill the remaining position (if T is in 1, then position2 and position5 are open; if T is in 2, then position1 and position5 are open).

Case 2: R in position 5.
Then the pattern is: _ _ A _ R
And T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

So pattern: T _ A _ R, or _ T A _ R, or _ _ A T R

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

We can try to think of words that fit.

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we want a guess that can test between these cases and use common letters.

We have not used many vowels. The only vowel we have is A (and we know it's in position3). We have excluded E and O. So the remaining vowels are I, U, and sometimes Y.

We should consider including a vowel to get more information.

But we also have to include R and T? Not necessarily in the next guess, but we know they are in the word so we might as well use them to get positional information.

However, we have two letters to place and we don't know where, so we might design a guess that can help us locate both.

Let me list possible words for each case to see what is possible.

First, case 1: R in position 4 -> pattern _ _ A R _

With T in position 1: T _ A R _
Possible words: 
- TYPER? But E is excluded.
- TAPIR? But I is allowed, and P is not excluded. T A P I R -> but wait, position3 is A, so if we have T in1, then position2 must be a letter, then A in3, R in4, and then position5. So for T _ A R _, the word must be T?A R?.

Examples: 
- ""TABOR"" -> but O is excluded.
- ""TAMAR"" -> not a word? 
- ""TAPIR"" -> T(1) A(2) P(3) I(4) R(5) -> but we need A in position3? Here A is in position2, so not matching pattern.

We need the third letter to be A, so the word must be: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5] and we are saying letter4 is R and letter1 is T? So: T [letter2] A R [letter5]

So words: 
- ""TAROT"" -> T A R O T -> but O is excluded and also the pattern: T(1) A(2) R(3) O(4) T(5) -> but we need A in position3? No, this has A in position2. We need the third letter to be A, so it must be: T [consonant?] A R [vowel?]

Examples: 
- ""THAR ?"" -> not a word.
- ""TIARA"" -> T I A R A -> T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. But we have two A's? The feedback for the first guess had A correct in position3, but it didn't say anything about other A's. So it's possible. But we have to check if A is allowed again? The feedback doesn't indicate if there are duplicate letters. So ""tiara"" is a word. But we have excluded letters? T, I, A, R, A. A is allowed (we know it's in), but we have to check if any excluded: I is not excluded, T is in the word, R is in the word. Excluded are C, E, N, O, S. So ""tiara"" is possible? But let's see: T is in position1, but we know T is in the word and not in position5, but in ""tiara"", T is in position1 and also in position5? The feedback for T in guess2 was a dash in position5, meaning T is in the word but not in position5. But if the word is ""tiara"", then T is in position1 and not in position5, which is consistent. However, the dash for T in guess2 was because we put T in position5 and it was wrong, but T is in the word (at position1). So that's fine. But in ""tiara"", the letter at position5 is A, not T. So T is only at position1. So that's okay.

But we have two A's: one at position3 and one at position5. Is that allowed? Yes, Wordle allows duplicate letters.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate A's. It might.

Another word: ""TALAR"" -> T A L A R? But then pattern: T(1) A(2) L(3) A(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, so not.

We need position3 to be A, so the word must be: T [letter2] A R [letter5]. So letter2 and letter5 to be filled.

Possible: 
- ""TIBAR"" ? not a word.
- ""TIGAR"" ? not common.
- ""TIMAR"" ? not a word.
- ""TITAR"" ? no.

""TIARA"" is one: T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5)

Another: ""TAROK"" ? but O excluded.

""TARED"" ? E excluded.

""TARAF"" ? not common, but F is allowed.

But let's not get stuck. We also have the case with T in position2.

Case1: R in position4, T in position2: pattern _ T A R _

So [letter1] T A R [letter5]

Words:
- ""STAR ?"" but S excluded.
- ""UTARA"" ? U T A R A -> U(1) T(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. U is a vowel, not excluded.

""UTARA"" is a place name? But Wordle accepts some proper nouns? Usually not, so let's stick to common words.

""ALTAR"" -> A L T A R -> but then position1 is A, but we have A in position3? And also, we have A in position1 and position3? Pattern: A(1) L(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, here it's T. Not matching.

We need: [letter1] T A R [letter5]

So:
- ""STA R"" but S excluded.
- ""PTAR?"" no.
- ""MTAR?"" no.

""ATTAR"" -> A T T A R -> A(1) T(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> but position3 is T, not A. Not matching.

It's hard to find words for this pattern.

Now case 2: R in position5 -> pattern _ _ A _ R

And T in position1,2, or4.

Subcases:

T in position1: T _ A _ R
Words: 
- ""TAPIR"" -> T A P I R -> T(1) A(2) P(3) I(4) R(5) -> but we need position3 to be A, here it's P. Not.
- ""TAMER"" -> E excluded.
- ""TASER"" -> S and E excluded.

We need: T [letter2] A [letter4] R

So: 
- ""TEAR ?"" E excluded.
- ""TIAR?"" -> ""TIARA"" we considered, but that has R in position4, not 5. Here we want R in5.

""TIARA"" has R in4, so not.

""TIGAR"" not a word.

""TILAR"" not.

""TONAR"" O excluded.

Not many.

T in position2: _ T A _ R
Pattern: [letter1] T A [letter4] R

Words:
- ""STA R"" S excluded.
- ""UTAHR"" -> U T A H R -> U(1) T(2) A(3) H(4) R(5) -> this could be ""UTAH"" is a state, but ""UTAHR"" is not a word. 
- ""ALTAR"" -> A L T A R -> A(1) L(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A. Not.

We need position3 to be A, so: [letter1] T A [letter4] R

Examples:
- ""STAR ?"" S excluded.
- ""PTAR?"" no.
- ""METAR"" E excluded.
- ""NOTAR"" O excluded.

""ATTAR"" -> A T T A R -> A(1) T(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

Hard to find.

T in position4: _ _ A T R
Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A T R

Words:
- ""MATER"" -> M A T E R -> E excluded.
- ""CATER"" -> C excluded.
- ""HATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""LATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""WATER"" -> E excluded.
- ""PATAR"" not a word.

But we have to avoid E. So:

- ""BA T R"" -> ""BATAR"" not a word.
- ""DATAR"" not common.
- ""FATAR"" not.
- ""HATAR"" not.
- ""LATAR"" not common.
- ""MATAR"" -> M A T A R -> M(1) A(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

We need position3 to be A, so: [letter1] [letter2] A T R

So the word ends with ""ATR"", like:
- ""BATR"" not.
- ""CATR"" not.
- ""DATR"" not.
- ""EATR"" E excluded.
- ""FATR"" not.
- ""GATR"" not.
- ""HATR"" not.
- ""IATR"" not.
- ""JATR"" not.
- ""KATR"" not.
- ""LATR"" not.
- ""MATR"" not.
- ""NATR"" N excluded.
- ""OATR"" O excluded.
- ""PATR"" not a word, but ""PATRY"" not.
- ""RATR"" not.
- ""SATR"" S excluded.
- ""TATR"" not.
- ""UATR"" not.
- ""VATR"" not.
- ""WATR"" not.
- ""XATR"" not.
- ""YATR"" not.
- ""ZATR"" not.

It seems difficult. Maybe ""AATR"" but not a word.

Perhaps I missed a word. What about ""TAWDR"" not.

Another idea: maybe the word has duplicate letters. For example, in case 1 with R in position4 and T in position1, we have ""TIARA"" which works.

Similarly, for other cases.

But in case 2, with R in position5 and T in position4, we have words like ""ALTAR"" but that has A in position1 and T in position3, not A in position3.

We need to have A in position3.

Let me think of common words with A in position3.

For example, ""LEAST"" but S and E excluded.

""PLANT"" but N excluded.

""TRACK"" C excluded.

""GRAND"" but N excluded.

""BRAND"" N excluded.

""CRANE"" we tried, excluded.

""BRAVE"" E excluded.

""FRAME"" E excluded.

""GRACE"" C and E excluded.

""SHADE"" E excluded.

""STALE"" S and E excluded.

With the excluded letters, it's limited.

Available vowels: I, U, and sometimes Y.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know R and T are in the word.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and contain R and T, and avoid C,E,N,O,S.

For example:

- ""TAWAR"" -> T A W A R -> T(1) A(2) W(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is W, not A. Not.

- ""TIARA"" -> T I A R A -> T(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) A(5) -> this works. Letters: T, I, A, R, A. A is duplicated. Excluded letters none. R is in position4.

- ""KARAT"" -> K A R A T -> K(1) A(2) R(3) A(4) T(5) -> position3 is R, not A. Not.

- ""PARAD"" -> P A R A D -> P(1) A(2) R(3) A(4) D(5) -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""MARAS"" S excluded.

- ""VARNA"" N excluded.

- ""HARAM"" -> H A R A M -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""BARRA"" -> B A R R A -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""DARAF"" -> D A R A F -> position3 is R, not A.

- ""FARAD"" E? not, but position3 is R.

It seems ""TIARA"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""RADAR"" but we have R in position1 and position5, and A in position2 and4, but position3 is D, not A.

""PAPAL"" -> P A P A L -> position3 is P, not A.

""LABIA"" -> L A B I A -> position3 is B, not A.

""MANIA"" N excluded.

""RABAT"" but we have R in1, A in2, B in3, A in4, T in5 -> position3 is B, not A.

So ""TIARA"" seems a valid word.

But in ""TIARA"", R is in position4, which is one of the options.

Also, T is in position1, which is consistent with the feedback that T is not in position5.

And A is in position3 and also in position5.

Now, are there other words?

What about ""TRAIT"" -> T R A I T -> T(1) R(2) A(3) I(4) T(5) -> but we know R cannot be in position2 (from guess1 feedback). So invalid.

""TRAIL"" -> same issue, R in position2.

""TRIAD"" -> T R I A D -> T(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) D(5) -> position3 is I, not A.

""TRIAL"" -> T R I A L -> position3 is I, not A.

""TAROT"" -> T A R O T -> O excluded and position3 is R, not A.

""TALAR"" -> T A L A R -> position3 is L, not A.

So ""TIARA"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make a guess, and we can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities.

Since we have limited information, we might guess a word that has R in position4 or 5 and T in a different position, and uses new letters.

For example, we can try to put R in position5 to see if it's there, and T in position1 or 2.

But from above, it's hard to find words with R in position5 and A in position3.

Another word: ""GUARD"" -> G U A R D -> G(1) U(2) A(3) R(4) D(5) -> this has R in position4, not 5.

""GUAR"" is not 5 letters.

""JAZAR"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LAVAR"" not common.

Maybe ""VAPOR"" O excluded.

It seems that having R in position4 is more likely given the word list.

Another common word: ""LARVA"" -> L A R V A -> position3 is R, not A.

""PARTA"" -> P A R T A -> position3 is R, not A.

""ARTAL"" -> A R T A L -> position3 is T, not A.

I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess, but let's see if we can find a word with R in position5.

For example, ""SITAR"" -> S I T A R -> S(1) I(2) T(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is T, not A.

""GITAR"" not.

""MITRA"" -> M I T R A -> position3 is T, not A.

""VITRA"" not.

So perhaps there are no common words with A in position3 and R in position5.

Therefore, R is likely in position4.

Similarly, T must be in position1 or 2.

In ""TIARA"", we have T in position1 and I in position2.

We could guess ""TIARA"" directly.

But to be safe, we might guess a word that tests the position of T and R with new letters.

For example, we can guess a word with T in position1, a new letter in position2, A in3, R in4, and a new letter in5.

Like ""TIGAR"" not a word, or ""TIBAR"" not.

""TIMAR"" not.

""TIPAR"" not.

""TIVAR"" not.

""TIARA"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another word: ""DIARY"" -> D I A R Y -> D(1) I(2) A(3) R(4) Y(5) -> this works! And it avoids excluded letters: D, I, A, R, Y. Y is allowed.

""DIARY"" has A in position3, R in position4, T is not in it? But we know T is in the word. ""DIARY"" does not have T, but we know T is in the word from guess2 feedback (T was a dash, so present). So ""DIARY"" cannot be the word because it lacks T.

Similarly, ""DAIRY"" same thing.

""FAIRY"" has no T.

""HAIRY"" no T.

""LAIRY"" no T.

""MAIRY"" not common.

""PAIRY"" not.

So they don't work because they miss T.

We must include T.

Another word: ""TAINT"" -> T A I N T -> N excluded and position3 is I, not A.

""TASTE"" S and E excluded.

""TAROT"" O excluded.

""TARTY"" -> T A R T Y -> T(1) A(2) R(3) T(4) Y(5) -> position3 is R, not A.

Not.

So back to ""TIARA"", which has T and R and A.

But ""TIARA"" has T in position1, I in2, A in3, R in4, A in5.

We can also consider ""ARIAS"" but S excluded and no T.

Or ""CARAT"" C excluded.

So I think ""TIARA"" is a valid guess.

Perhaps ""RATIO"" but O excluded and R in position1, but we know R is not in position1 (from guess2 feedback: R in position1 was dash, so not there).

In guess2, we had ""roast"" with R in1 and got dash, so R not in1.

So for the secret word, R cannot be in1.

In ""TIARA"", R is in4, which is allowed.

Another possibility: ""BRIAR"" -> B R I A R -> B(1) R(2) I(3) A(4) R(5) -> position3 is I, not A, and R in position2 which is not allowed.

Not.

So I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if ""TIARA"" is the secret word.

But we don't know, so we are guessing.

We could guess a word that has T in position2 and R in position4, but we couldn't find one.

Or T in position4 and R in position5, but no words.

So I'll go with ""TIARA"".

But in ""TIARA"", the letter A is duplicated. We don't know if the secret word has duplicate A's, but it's possible.

Another word: ""TRAIT"" not possible because of R in2.

""TRACT"" C excluded.

Perhaps ""DRAIN"" N excluded.

I think ""TIARA"" is the best bet.

So next guess: ""tiara""

But let's see if there's a word with T in position2 and R in position4.

For example, ""PTAR?"" no.

""UTARA"" not common.

""ITALY"" -> I T A L Y -> I(1) T(2) A(3) L(4) Y(5) -> this has A in position3, T in position2, but no R. But we need R in the word. ""ITALY"" does not have R, but we know R is in the word. So not.

""FATAL"" no R.

""KAPUT"" O? not, and no R.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""TIARA"" is a good guess.

We can also consider ""TAWDR"" not a word.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  
  - This reveals:  
    - ""A"" is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
    - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.  
    - ""C"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: roast** → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(-)  
  - This reveals:  
    - ""A"" is confirmed again at position 3.  
    - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was misplaced in position 1 here).  
    - ""T"" is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - ""O"" and ""S"" are not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Pattern**: The word must be `_ _ A _ _` (since ""A"" is fixed at position 3).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**:  
  - ""A"" (position 3), ""R"" (somewhere, but not position 1, 2, or 3), and ""T"" (somewhere, but not position 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, N, O, S (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Possible positions for ""R""**: Only positions 4 or 5 remain (since positions 1, 2, and 3 are invalid based on feedback).  
- **Possible positions for ""T""**: Positions 1, 2, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid, and position 3 is taken by ""A"").  
- **Constraints**:  
  - ""R"" and ""T"" cannot share the same position.  
  - The word must include two additional letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, E, N, O, S).  

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- Given the feedback, ""R"" is likely in position 4 (as position 5 is less common for ""R"" in 5-letter words with ""A"" at position 3, and no common words fit with ""R"" in position 5 under the constraints).  
- ""T"" is likely in position 1 or 2.  
- ""TIARA"" is a strong candidate because:  
  - It tests ""T"" in position 1 and ""R"" in position 4.  
  - It includes ""I"" (a common vowel not yet tested) and a second ""A"" (duplicate letters are allowed in Wordle).  
  - It fits the pattern `T _ A R _` and avoids all excluded letters.  
  - If correct, it could solve the word. If not, the feedback will clarify the positions of ""T"" and ""R"" and test new letters (""I"" and the duplicate ""A"").  

### Why ""TIARA""?
- Tests key positions:  
  - Position 1: ""T"" (if correct, confirms ""T"" placement; if misplaced, indicates ""T"" is in position 2 or 4).  
  - Position 4: ""R"" (if correct, confirms ""R"" placement; if misplaced, ""R"" must be in position 5).  
  - Position 2: ""I"" (new vowel, tests for presence).  
  - Position 5: ""A"" (tests for duplicate ""A"").  
- Maximizes information: Uses 3 new letters (I, and duplicate A) while leveraging known constraints.",Guess 3: tiara -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) A(✓) R(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
