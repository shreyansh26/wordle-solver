We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: - -> in the word but wrong position
- A: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so A is the second letter in the secret word)
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since our R was in the second position of ""crane"" but got moved, and we now know position 2 is A). So R is in the word, but somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We should now guess a word that:
- Has A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter R (because we know R is present) but not in the second position (which is taken by A) and not in the fifth (which is E). So R should be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoids using the letters C and N (since they are absent).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

We also know that the word must include R (somewhere in positions 1,3,4). Let's consider common letters.

Possible words: 
- RAISE: R A I S E -> This has A in second, E at fifth. Also includes R at first. But we have to check the feedback for other letters later.
But note: we haven't tried S or I yet. 

We can also think of other words like ""RAZED"", ""RAPED"", ""RARED"", etc., but we must use valid English words.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests other common consonants to gather more information.

However, since we already know A and E are fixed, and R is present, we can focus on placing R and finding the other letters.

But remember: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got a minus, meaning in the secret word R is not at position 2 (which we already know because position 2 is A) and also not at position 1? Wait, not necessarily. The feedback only tells us it's present but not at the guessed position. So R could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to list words matching _ A _ _ E that contain R and avoid C,N.

Some options:
- RANGE: has A in second, E at fifth. But contains N which we know is absent -> invalid.
- RAREE: not common, and double R? Also E at fifth, but second letter A? No, R A R E E -> but that's not 5 distinct? Anyway, R in first and third. But we have no info on double letters? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? Our feedback wouldn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess them.

But note: our feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it showed as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two R's, then we might have more than one R marked? But in this case, we only have one R in the guess and one mark. So we don't know.

We must avoid N and C.

Another word: ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E: 
- Positions: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.
- This meets the pattern and includes R in position 1.

Also, we can try ""RAZE"": but that's 4 letters. Not 5.

""RATED"": T and D are new letters. Pattern: R A T E D -> fifth letter is D, not E -> doesn't meet pattern (must be E at fifth). 

""RAZED"": R A Z E D -> fifth is D -> not E.

It has to end with E. So:

Other options: 
  ""RAPED"" -> R A P E D: fifth letter D -> invalid.

We need fifth letter E.

Valid: 
  ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E
  ""PRASE"" -> P R A S E: but note the pattern is P at first, then R at second? But our pattern must be A at second. In ""PRASE"", the second letter is R -> not A? So no.

We must have second letter A and fifth E.

How about: ""BRAVE""? Let's see: B R A V E -> second letter R? But we need A at second -> no.

Wait, we must have the second position as A and fifth as E.

So: 
  Position 1: ? 
  Position 2: A 
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: ? 
  Position 5: E 

And the word contains R (somewhere in 1,3,4).

Possible words:

- R A ? ? E: e.g., ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E), ""RAMIE"" (R-A-M-I-E), ""RACEY"" (but C is absent -> invalid), ""RARED"" (R-A-R-E-D -> fifth letter D, invalid) etc.

After avoiding C and N, let's try:

- ""RAISE"": R A I S E -> might be a candidate.
- ""RABBE"": not a common word? Invalid.

Maybe we can include other common letters that haven't been tested: like S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1,3,4 but actually position 1 is open? Wait, we don't know position 1. Since R could be in position 1, but it might not.

We also know R is present, but it might not be in the first position.

So another possibility: the R in the secret word is not in position 1? Then the word could have R in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
  ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> but fifth letter E? Yes: G at fourth, E at fifth -> so BARGE: positions B A R G E. 
  This has A at second, E at fifth, and R at third. Also avoids C and N.

Another: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at second, E at fifth? S is at fourth -> P A R S E -> yes, and R at third.

Another: ""TARSE"": not common.

Or ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> similar to BARGE.

And ""MARVE"": not common.

Also ""WARRE"": not common.

So among common words: RAISE, BARGE, PARSE, LARGE, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In RAISE: letters R, A, I, S, E -> we already know A, E, and R. So only I and S are new. And we can see if R is in position 1.

In BARGE: letters B, A, R, G, E -> we know A, R, E, but B and G are new. R is in position 3.

Similarly, PARSE has P, A, R, S, E -> P and S are new.

We also have 5 tries left? Actually, this is our second guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't necessarily include R, but wait: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it? Actually no. We are allowed to guess words without R? But we know R is present, so if we don't include R, we might get feedback that misses that. However, the rules don't require including known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

But we have fixed A at 2 and E at 5, so the pattern is _ A _ _ E.

And we must avoid C and N.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses R at first and then tests I and S. Also, it's a common word.

But note: if the secret word were, say, ""BARGE"", then guessing ""RAISE"" would give us some feedback:

But let's see what feedback we would get if secret word is BARGE and we guess RAISE:

- R: in BARGE? R is in position 3 -> so our guess R at position1: wrong position? So we would get R(-) -> because R is in the word but not at position 1.
- A: correct position -> A(✓)
- I: not in BARGE -> I(x)
- S: not in BARGE -> S(x)
- E: correct position -> E(✓)

But that doesn't help us much? But we don't know the secret word. However, we are trying to gather more letters.

Alternatively, if we guess BARGE:

And the secret word might be something else.

But we don't know. So I think ""RAISE"" is a reasonable guess.

Another idea: we can use a word that has R and other common letters and avoids repeating known letters.

But let me list some other words that fit: LARGE, BARGE, PARSE, FARSE? (invalid), MARSE? (invalid). Also, ""CARLE"" -> C is absent -> invalid. So not many.

Also: ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> but we know A and E. S and T are new. But does it contain R? No, but we know R is present. So if we guess PASTE, it doesn't include R, so we might expect:
- P: unknown
- A: correct ✓
- S: unknown
- T: unknown
- E: correct ✓

And then R would not be in the guess, so we might get a minus for R? Wait, but R is present, so the feedback would show that we are missing R? It does: because R is in the word but not in the guess, so we wouldn't get any indication? Actually, no: the feedback per letter only applies to the letters we guessed. So if we don't guess R, we don't get any feedback about R. But we know from the first guess that there is an R? But we haven't placed it.

To avoid wasting a guess, we should include R.

So back to including R.

Therefore, I choose ""RAISE"". It places R at the first position which we don't know, but we know R is elsewhere if not.

Thus, guess: RAISE.

<guess>raise</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **absent** (x).  
- R is **present but not in position 2** (-), since position 2 is now confirmed as A (✓).  
- A is in the **correct position (2)** (✓).  
- E is in the **correct position (5)** (✓).  

The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? E**, and contains the letter **R** (in positions 1, 3, or 4).   
C and N are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize words matching **? A ? ? E** and including **R** (but not in position 2).  
- Test new common letters (avoid C and N) to gather more information.  
- ""RAISE"" fits:  
  - Ends in E (position 5 ✓).  
  - Second letter A (position 2 ✓).  
  - Includes R (tests position 1).  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **S** for coverage.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities (e.g., BARGE, PARSE, LARGE) while leveraging known constraints.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: - -> in the word but wrong position
- A: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so A is the second letter in the secret word)
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since our R was in the second position of ""crane"" but got moved, and we now know position 2 is A). So R is in the word, but somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We should now guess a word that:
- Has A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter R (because we know R is present) but not in the second position (which is taken by A) and not in the fifth (which is E). So R should be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoids using the letters C and N (since they are absent).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

We also know that the word must include R (somewhere in positions 1,3,4). Let's consider common letters.

Possible words: 
- RAISE: R A I S E -> This has A in second, E at fifth. Also includes R at first. But we have to check the feedback for other letters later.
But note: we haven't tried S or I yet. 

We can also think of other words like ""RAZED"", ""RAPED"", ""RARED"", etc., but we must use valid English words.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests other common consonants to gather more information.

However, since we already know A and E are fixed, and R is present, we can focus on placing R and finding the other letters.

But remember: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got a minus, meaning in the secret word R is not at position 2 (which we already know because position 2 is A) and also not at position 1? Wait, not necessarily. The feedback only tells us it's present but not at the guessed position. So R could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to list words matching _ A _ _ E that contain R and avoid C,N.

Some options:
- RANGE: has A in second, E at fifth. But contains N which we know is absent -> invalid.
- RAREE: not common, and double R? Also E at fifth, but second letter A? No, R A R E E -> but that's not 5 distinct? Anyway, R in first and third. But we have no info on double letters? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? Our feedback wouldn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess them.

But note: our feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it showed as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two R's, then we might have more than one R marked? But in this case, we only have one R in the guess and one mark. So we don't know.

We must avoid N and C.

Another word: ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E: 
- Positions: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.
- This meets the pattern and includes R in position 1.

Also, we can try ""RAZE"": but that's 4 letters. Not 5.

""RATED"": T and D are new letters. Pattern: R A T E D -> fifth letter is D, not E -> doesn't meet pattern (must be E at fifth). 

""RAZED"": R A Z E D -> fifth is D -> not E.

It has to end with E. So:

Other options: 
  ""RAPED"" -> R A P E D: fifth letter D -> invalid.

We need fifth letter E.

Valid: 
  ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E
  ""PRASE"" -> P R A S E: but note the pattern is P at first, then R at second? But our pattern must be A at second. In ""PRASE"", the second letter is R -> not A? So no.

We must have second letter A and fifth E.

How about: ""BRAVE""? Let's see: B R A V E -> second letter R? But we need A at second -> no.

Wait, we must have the second position as A and fifth as E.

So: 
  Position 1: ? 
  Position 2: A 
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: ? 
  Position 5: E 

And the word contains R (somewhere in 1,3,4).

Possible words:

- R A ? ? E: e.g., ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E), ""RAMIE"" (R-A-M-I-E), ""RACEY"" (but C is absent -> invalid), ""RARED"" (R-A-R-E-D -> fifth letter D, invalid) etc.

After avoiding C and N, let's try:

- ""RAISE"": R A I S E -> might be a candidate.
- ""RABBE"": not a common word? Invalid.

Maybe we can include other common letters that haven't been tested: like S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1,3,4 but actually position 1 is open? Wait, we don't know position 1. Since R could be in position 1, but it might not.

We also know R is present, but it might not be in the first position.

So another possibility: the R in the secret word is not in position 1? Then the word could have R in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
  ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> but fifth letter E? Yes: G at fourth, E at fifth -> so BARGE: positions B A R G E. 
  This has A at second, E at fifth, and R at third. Also avoids C and N.

Another: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at second, E at fifth? S is at fourth -> P A R S E -> yes, and R at third.

Another: ""TARSE"": not common.

Or ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> similar to BARGE.

And ""MARVE"": not common.

Also ""WARRE"": not common.

So among common words: RAISE, BARGE, PARSE, LARGE, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In RAISE: letters R, A, I, S, E -> we already know A, E, and R. So only I and S are new. And we can see if R is in position 1.

In BARGE: letters B, A, R, G, E -> we know A, R, E, but B and G are new. R is in position 3.

Similarly, PARSE has P, A, R, S, E -> P and S are new.

We also have 5 tries left? Actually, this is our second guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't necessarily include R, but wait: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it? Actually no. We are allowed to guess words without R? But we know R is present, so if we don't include R, we might get feedback that misses that. However, the rules don't require including known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

But we have fixed A at 2 and E at 5, so the pattern is _ A _ _ E.

And we must avoid C and N.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses R at first and then tests I and S. Also, it's a common word.

But note: if the secret word were, say, ""BARGE"", then guessing ""RAISE"" would give us some feedback:

But let's see what feedback we would get if secret word is BARGE and we guess RAISE:

- R: in BARGE? R is in position 3 -> so our guess R at position1: wrong position? So we would get R(-) -> because R is in the word but not at position 1.
- A: correct position -> A(✓)
- I: not in BARGE -> I(x)
- S: not in BARGE -> S(x)
- E: correct position -> E(✓)

But that doesn't help us much? But we don't know the secret word. However, we are trying to gather more letters.

Alternatively, if we guess BARGE:

And the secret word might be something else.

But we don't know. So I think ""RAISE"" is a reasonable guess.

Another idea: we can use a word that has R and other common letters and avoids repeating known letters.

But let me list some other words that fit: LARGE, BARGE, PARSE, FARSE? (invalid), MARSE? (invalid). Also, ""CARLE"" -> C is absent -> invalid. So not many.

Also: ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> but we know A and E. S and T are new. But does it contain R? No, but we know R is present. So if we guess PASTE, it doesn't include R, so we might expect:
- P: unknown
- A: correct ✓
- S: unknown
- T: unknown
- E: correct ✓

And then R would not be in the guess, so we might get a minus for R? Wait, but R is present, so the feedback would show that we are missing R? It does: because R is in the word but not in the guess, so we wouldn't get any indication? Actually, no: the feedback per letter only applies to the letters we guessed. So if we don't guess R, we don't get any feedback about R. But we know from the first guess that there is an R? But we haven't placed it.

To avoid wasting a guess, we should include R.

So back to including R.

Therefore, I choose ""RAISE"". It places R at the first position which we don't know, but we know R is elsewhere if not.

Thus, guess: RAISE.

<guess>raise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **absent** (x).  
- R is **present but not in position 2** (-), since position 2 is now confirmed as A (✓).  
- A is in the **correct position (2)** (✓).  
- E is in the **correct position (5)** (✓).  

The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? E**, and contains the letter **R** (in positions 1, 3, or 4).   
C and N are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize words matching **? A ? ? E** and including **R** (but not in position 2).  
- Test new common letters (avoid C and N) to gather more information.  
- ""RAISE"" fits:  
  - Ends in E (position 5 ✓).  
  - Second letter A (position 2 ✓).  
  - Includes R (tests position 1).  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **S** for coverage.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities (e.g., BARGE, PARSE, LARGE) while leveraging known constraints.

We are given feedback from the two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, but not in position 2 (-) -> since guessed in position 2, but actually position 2 in secret is A (we know that because A was correct). So R is elsewhere.
  A: correct at position 2 (✓)
  N: absent (x)
  E: correct at position 5 (✓)

So we know: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ E
  R is present but not at position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4)
  Absent letters: C, N

From Guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: present but not at position 1 (-) -> so R is not at position 1. Combined with first guess, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 is A).
  A: present but not at position 2 (-) -> wait, but we already know A is fixed at position 2? How can A be present but wrong position? 
      This is a conflict because we know from the first guess that A is at position 2. So what does this mean?

Let me interpret: 
  In ""raise"", the A is at position 2. But the feedback says A(-), meaning present but not at this position? 
  However, we already have A fixed at position 2 from the first guess. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓? 
  This suggests an issue. Let me reread.

Wait, the secret word has A at position 2. In ""raise"", we have A at position 2, so it must be correct. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓, not (-). 
But the feedback we got is: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓). That says A is present but not at position 2? 
This is impossible because we know position 2 is A and we are guessing position 2 as A.

There might be a misunderstanding? Let me double-check the example. In the example, in guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) ... meaning correctly positioned.

So for a letter that is correctly positioned, we should get ✓. 
Therefore, in ""raise"", since we know position 2 is A, and we put A at position 2, it must be ✓.

But the feedback says A(-). This is inconsistent with the rules.

Alternatively, there might be a typo in the user message? Or an error in my reasoning.

Wait, note: the feedback we got: 
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we know from the first guess that:
- Position 2: A (correct) -> so the secret word has A at position 2.
- Position 5: E (correct) -> secret has E at position 5.

So in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct, so why is it marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position?

This implies that the secret word does not actually have A at position 2? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Unless the secret word changed? But the rules say one secret word.

This seems like a discrepancy. Let me re-read the first feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

Here, A and E are marked correct. So A is at position 2 of the secret word, E at position 5.

So in the second guess, ""raise"":
- Position 1: R -> gets (-), meaning R is present but not at position 1.
- Position 2: A -> should be ✓, but gets (-)? This can't be.

Therefore, I suspect a typo in the feedback. Could it be that the feedback for A is ✓? Let me consider:

Perhaps the feedback format: It says ""A(-)"" but maybe it's a mistake?

Another possibility: maybe the secret word has two A's? For example, maybe the word is like ""TASER"" or ""PARSE""? 

But let's look: First guess: crane -> A and E are correct at positions 2 and 5. So secret: ? A ? ? E.

Second guess: raise -> 
R at position 1 -> marked present but not position 1 -> so R is present but not at 1. 
A at position 2 -> we expected ✓ but got (-). What does this mean? It means the A is present, but not at position 2? But we know that in secret, position 2 is A. So it should be correct.

This is confusing. Unless the secret word has letter A elsewhere, but not at position 2? But the first guess told us A is at position 2.

So I think there's an error. Perhaps in the input, the feedback was miswritten.

Alternatively, let's consider if the secret word has only one A? Then in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct.

I think we have to assume the feedback is as provided, so we must resolve the conflict.

Another thought: Maybe the secret word has the letter A but not at position 2? But the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2, which means the secret has A at position 2.

Therefore, the second feedback saying A(-) at position 2 is impossible. This must be a mistake. I should consider that the A is actually misplaced in the context of the second guess? But no, because the first guess fixed it.

Let me read the first feedback: ""A(✓)"" for crane at position 2, so secret position 2 is A.

Second guess: at position 2, we have A again. So it should be ✓. But it is reported as A(-), which is a minus.

This seems like an error. Perhaps I should proceed with the given feedback and reinterpret.

Given feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: raise -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we have E(✓) in both, so at least position 5 is E.

Now, position 2: we have conflicting information. From guess 1, A is correct at position 2. In guess 2, A is at position 2 but now marked as (-), meaning it is present elsewhere but not at position 2? That would mean the secret does not have A at position 2? But then the first feedback was wrong.

This inconsistency cannot be resolved. Perhaps the secret word has two A's? And the position 2 is A in secret, but the second time we guess A at position 2, but if secret has two A's, it should still be correctly placed? Unless the feedback for duplicate letters is handled specially? But usually, in Wordle-style games, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might show only one correct or something? But typically, if you guess a letter in the correct position, it gets ✓, regardless of duplicates.

But in this case, position 2 must be A. So why in guess 2 we got A(-)? It doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the first guess feedback was misinterpreted. Feedback for ""crane"" said A(✓) at position 2? So we are sure.

The only explanation is that the secret word has changed? Or there is a bug? But per rules, it's the same secret word.

I think I should proceed with what is given: so let's gather what we know:

From guess 1:
  C: x
  R: - → implies R is in the word, not at position 2 (where it was guessed).
  A: ✓ at position 2 → so secret: position 2 is A.
  N: x
  E: ✓ at position 5 → secret: position 5 is E.

So secret pattern: _ A _ _ E
R is in the word but not at position 2, so at position 1, 3, or 4.

From guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: - → R is present but not at position 1? So not at 1.
    Combined with above, R must be at position 3 or 4.
  A: - → but wait, this is the problem. If secret position 2 is A, then our A at position 2 should be ✓. But we got - (“in the word but wrong position”). This means that the letter at position 2 in secret is not A? But from first guess, it is A. Unless the first feedback was wrong? It can’t be.

Another interpretation: feedback for A in guess 2 is (-), which means it is in the word but not at position 2? Which would imply that secret position 2 is not A? But then the first feedback A(✓) would mean something else? That’s impossible.

Let me read the rules: after each guess, feedback tells for each letter:
  ✓: correct letter and correct position.
  -: letter is in the word but not this position.
  x: letter not in the word.

In guess 1, for ""crane"", position 2 (which is R) got a minus, and position ? which is A — wait, let's break down guess 1:

c r a n e
positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

Feedback:
C(1):x, R(2):- that means R is present but not at position 2.
A(3):✓ → secret has A at position 3? Wait a minute! I think I made a critical mistake.

Oh no! In the first guess, the guess ""crane"" has letters at positions:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: N
5: E

Feedback: 
- C(1): x
- R(2): - → means R is in secret but not at position 2
- A(3): ✓ → means A is in secret and at position 3
- N(4): x
- E(5): ✓ → means E is in secret and at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A at position 3 (since A in guess position 3 got ✓)
- E at position 5 (✓)
- R is present but not at position 2 (in fact, not at position 2 of the secret either? But it doesn't tell us the position, only that the guess position 2 is wrong)

So secret pattern: P1 unknown, P2 unknown, P3=A, P4 unknown, P5=E.

This is a big mistake in my earlier reasoning. I incorrectly assumed the positions.

So to summarize:
- From guess 1: 
  - Secret's position 3 is A (because our A at position 3 was ✓)
  - Secret's position 5 is E (✓)
  - R is in the word, but not at the position we guessed it (position 2) -> so secret has R but not at position 2? It could be at position 1,3,4 but position 3 is A, so not position 3. So R must be at position 1 or 4? Or position 4? Let's list positions we know:
      Position 3: A
      Position 5: E
      So possible positions for R: 1, 4

But we can also have R at position 4? And at position 1? It's either or both? We don't know.

- C, N: absent.

Secret pattern: _ _ A _ E

Now, guess 2: ""raise"":
- Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
Feedback:
  R(1):- → R is present, but not at position 1. So secret has R, but not at position 1.
  A(2):- → A is present, but not at position 2. But we know secret has A at position 3, which is not position 2, so this makes sense: A is in the word, but at a different position (which we know is position 3).
  I(3):x → I is absent.
  S(4):- → S is present, but not at position 4.
  E(5):✓ → E is correct at position 5 (as we know).

We already knew E is at position 5, so no new info.

Now, combining:
From guess 1: R is present, not at position 2 (guessed position).
From guess 2: R is present, not at position 1 (guessed). So R cannot be at position 1 or 2. But secret positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> position 3 is A, not available. Position 5 is E, not available. So R must be at position 4? Or there are duplicates? For example, if secret has two R's? But we don't know yet.

Also, S is present but not at position 4.

Also, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, I

Now, secret pattern: positions:
Pos1: unknown
Pos2: unknown
Pos3: A
Pos4: must contain R or S? Or R and S? But we don't know.

We know R is present and not in position 1 or 2. Position 3 is A, position 5 is E. So R must be at position 4? Because position 4 is the only one left? Unless there is another position? Positions available for R: only position 4? Or could there be duplicate letters? For example, if the secret has R at position 4, and also at position 1? But we got R(1):- meaning that position 1 is not R? So no duplicate R at position 1? And feedback for R doesn't reveal duplicates.

But since R(1) was marked present but wrong position, it implies there is at least one R elsewhere. Since positions 1 and 2 are not R per feedbacks, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so R must be at position 4.

Similarly, S is present but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1 or 2.

From guess 1, R was guessed at position 2 and marked -, and also R is at position 4 in secret? Yes.

From guess 2, S is guessed at position 4 and marked -, so S is not at position 4. Since position 3 is A and position 5 is E, S must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, note that in guess 1, we didn't have S, so no conflict.

Summary:
- Secret: letter1: something (S or other)
- letter2: something (or S)
- letter3: A
- letter4: R   (since it must be there; see above)
- letter5: E

Also, present letters: R (at pos4), S (at pos1 or 2), A (pos3), E (pos5)
Absent: C, N, I

From guess 2, A is present and was guessed at position 2 but is actually at position 3, so minus, makes sense.

S is present but not at pos4, so in secret S must be at position 1 or 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ ? A R E, where _ can be S or other? But we know S is present, so either at 1 or 2.

But not necessarily S is at 1 or 2; it could also be that secret has S at a position we haven't guessed, but in the secret positions, only pos1 and pos2 are available for S? Because pos3,4,5 are filled: A at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

Yes: secret: 
  pos1: ?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: A
  pos4: R
  pos5: E

S is in the secret, but not at pos4 (where we guessed S). So S must be at pos1 or pos2? That's the only places.

Now, at pos1: letter, which could be S? Or at pos2: which could be S? But not both? Or could be duplicate S? Possible, but let's see.

So secret pattern: [S?] [S?] A R E

We know S is one of the first two letters? Or could be at pos1 and/or pos2.

We also know that there might be one or two S.

But we should try to find a word that matches: _ _ A R E, with S in the first or second position, and the other position to be filled.

But what are the possibilities?

Common words ending with ""ARE"" but not at the end: the word is ?? ARE -> five letters, so first two letters followed by ""ARE"".

Words: 
- STARE: S T A R E -> then pos1=S, pos2=T, pos3=A, pos4=R, pos5=E -> note S at position 1, T at 2.
- SCARE: but C is absent -> no
- SNARE: N is absent -> no
- SHARE: H unknown -> possible
- SPARE: P unknown -> possible
- STARE: as above
- SWARE: not common

Also: 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> pos1=G, pos2=L, then ARE -> does not have S? Unless S is at pos1? But if secret word is GLARE, it doesn't have S? But we know S is present.

So must have S and R and A and E.

Words with pattern: 
- If S is at pos1: then the word looks like S? ARE → e.g., STARE, SHARE, SPARE, etc.
- If S is at pos2: then the pattern is ? S ARE → e.g., US ARE -> but ""USARE"" is not a word, or ?SARE? -> 5 letter words: maybe ASHRE? no. Common words? 

""USHER"" not fit. Perhaps ""TSARE"": t s a r e? Tsare is a word? I think it's ""tsar"" but tsare? Not common.

Other possibilities: ?SARE: CSARE? C is absent. NSARE? N absent. So not many.

Therefore, it's more likely that S is at position 1: so words like STARE, SHARE, SPARE.

But we need to check with previous feedback.

We also need to avoid C and N and I.

So our next guess:

We can try to be systematic: we want to guess one of the possibilities: STARE, SHARE, SPARE, for example.

But we might also get feedback about other letters.

Let's consider: if we guess ""STARE"":

- S at pos1: secret has S at either pos1 or pos2. If secret has S at pos1, then S should be marked ✓? Otherwise, -?
- How: If secret has S at pos1, then our S at pos1 should be ✓.
- If secret has S at pos2, then our S at pos1 is present but not here? But in ""STARE"", S is at pos1, so if secret has S at pos2, then we get S(-) meaning it's present but not at pos1.

Similarly, T at pos2: unknown.

But in secret, position 2: could be S or other.

We also know that S is present in secret.

But to save guesses, we can guess ""STARE"":

- If the feedback gives S as ✓, then S is at pos1 and we have pattern S T A R E? But T might be wrong.
- Or if S is -, then S is at pos2.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, total 6 tries, we used 2.

But guessing ""STARE"" might resolve.

However, if we guess ""STARE"" and it's not the word, we get more feedback.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses new letters to test more.

For example, avoid repeating letters? But we have to include S? We can skip S? Or are there other constraints?

Another idea: include another common letter.

But to be efficient, let's list what we need to know: position 1 and position 2, one of which is S? Or both?

But since S is present, and not at pos4, and only pos1 and 2 available, then one of those is S? But there could be duplicates? For example, secret word ""SKATE"" doesn’t fit because K not S and T? But no: pattern must be ? ? A R E.

Let's think of words:

Examples::
- ""SPARE"": S P A R E -> if secret is this, then S at pos1.
- ""STARE"": S T A R E
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SWARE"": S W A R E, but WARE at end, valid? Yes.
- Also: ""SCORE"": C absent -> invalid
- ""SNORE"": N absent -> invalid
- ""GLARE"": G L A R E -> but does it have S? No.

""PARSE"": P A R S E -> pattern is P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but we know secret pos3 is A? But that would be position 3? In ""PARSE"", pos3 is R -> but our secret must have A at pos3, and R at pos4. So ""PARSE"" doesn't fit because it has R at pos3? So only words with A at pos3 and R at pos4.

So possible 5-letter words: [letter1][letter2]A R E

With S one of letter1 or letter2.

Now, letter1 and letter2: one is S? Or not necessarily. Actually, S must be at letter1 or letter2 because those are the only positions left.

So the first two letters include S and one other letter.

Common words: 
spare: S at1
stare: S at1
share: S at1
snare: not possible (N)
sward: not ARE pattern.

If S at pos2: 
Then words: ? S A R E -> for example, TSARE? Not common. 
Or DSARE? Not valid.
USARE? Not a word.
So no common words with S at position 2. 

Therefore, S must be at position 1.

So secret word is S _ A R E, with the second letter to be identified.

Common words: SPARE, STARE, SHARE, SWARE, etc.

Now, we know that C, N, I are absent.

So:
spare: P unknown
stare: T unknown
share: H unknown
sware: W unknown
Others: ""scare"" invalid (C), ""snare"" invalid (N).

We can guess ""STARE"": tests T.

But let's see the remaining letters.

Since we have one of the words, we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only unknown at position 2.

So I'll choose ""STARE"" as it is a common word.

Thus, guess.

But if I guess ""STARE"", then:

- If secret is ""SPARE"", then S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) -> T marked x?
- If secret is ""STARE"", then all ✓.

Either way, we get information.

But we have sufficient information if we get the feedback.

So let's guess ""STARE"".

But we need to choose a word that is valid. Assume all above are valid.

So I'll go with ""STARE"".

Feedback for STARE might tell us the second letter.

But in the context, let's do.

Another thought: in guess 2, we are told that S is present but not at pos4. Since we guess S at pos4, but it was not there. But now the secret must have S at pos1 (since common words support that).

Therefore, our next guess: STARE.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C (position 1): **x** → Absent, so eliminate C.
   - R (position 2): **-** → R is in the word but not at position 2.
   - A (position 3): **✓** → A is correct at position 3. Secret must have A at position 3.
   - N (position 4): **x** → Absent, so eliminate N.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → E is correct at position 5. Secret must have E at position 5.
   
   **Secret pattern so far:** `_ _ A _ E`  
   **Known letters:** R is present (but not at position 2), A at position 3, E at position 5.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""raise""):**
   - R (position 1): **-** → R is present but not at position 1.  
     Combined with Guess 1 (R not at position 2), R must be at position 4 (since position 3 is A and position 5 is E).
   - A (position 2): **-** → A is present but not at position 2. This is consistent, as A is fixed at position 3.
   - I (position 3): **x** → Absent, so eliminate I.
   - S (position 4): **-** → S is present but not at position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is now revealed as R, S must be at position 1 or 2.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → Confirms E at position 5.

   **Updated secret pattern:** `_ _ A R E`  
   **Known letters:**  
     - Position 3: A  
     - Position 4: R  
     - Position 5: E  
     - S is present at position 1 or 2.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N, I.

**Inference:**  
The secret word is `[letter1] [letter2] A R E`, where:  
- `letter1` or `letter2` must be S (since S is present and only positions 1 and 2 are open).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include **STARE**, **SHARE**, **SPARE**, or **SWARE**.  
- Given absent letters (C, N, I), **STARE** is a strong candidate: it tests S at position 1 and introduces T at position 2.  

**Next guess:**  
Guess **""stare""** to:  
- Confirm S at position 1 (if ✓, S is correct; if -, S must be at position 2).  
- Test T as a new letter.  

<guess>stare</guess>",stare,"We are given feedback from the two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, but not in position 2 (-) -> since guessed in position 2, but actually position 2 in secret is A (we know that because A was correct). So R is elsewhere.
  A: correct at position 2 (✓)
  N: absent (x)
  E: correct at position 5 (✓)

So we know: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ E
  R is present but not at position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4)
  Absent letters: C, N

From Guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: present but not at position 1 (-) -> so R is not at position 1. Combined with first guess, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 is A).
  A: present but not at position 2 (-) -> wait, but we already know A is fixed at position 2? How can A be present but wrong position? 
      This is a conflict because we know from the first guess that A is at position 2. So what does this mean?

Let me interpret: 
  In ""raise"", the A is at position 2. But the feedback says A(-), meaning present but not at this position? 
  However, we already have A fixed at position 2 from the first guess. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓? 
  This suggests an issue. Let me reread.

Wait, the secret word has A at position 2. In ""raise"", we have A at position 2, so it must be correct. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓, not (-). 
But the feedback we got is: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓). That says A is present but not at position 2? 
This is impossible because we know position 2 is A and we are guessing position 2 as A.

There might be a misunderstanding? Let me double-check the example. In the example, in guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) ... meaning correctly positioned.

So for a letter that is correctly positioned, we should get ✓. 
Therefore, in ""raise"", since we know position 2 is A, and we put A at position 2, it must be ✓.

But the feedback says A(-). This is inconsistent with the rules.

Alternatively, there might be a typo in the user message? Or an error in my reasoning.

Wait, note: the feedback we got: 
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we know from the first guess that:
- Position 2: A (correct) -> so the secret word has A at position 2.
- Position 5: E (correct) -> secret has E at position 5.

So in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct, so why is it marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position?

This implies that the secret word does not actually have A at position 2? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Unless the secret word changed? But the rules say one secret word.

This seems like a discrepancy. Let me re-read the first feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

Here, A and E are marked correct. So A is at position 2 of the secret word, E at position 5.

So in the second guess, ""raise"":
- Position 1: R -> gets (-), meaning R is present but not at position 1.
- Position 2: A -> should be ✓, but gets (-)? This can't be.

Therefore, I suspect a typo in the feedback. Could it be that the feedback for A is ✓? Let me consider:

Perhaps the feedback format: It says ""A(-)"" but maybe it's a mistake?

Another possibility: maybe the secret word has two A's? For example, maybe the word is like ""TASER"" or ""PARSE""? 

But let's look: First guess: crane -> A and E are correct at positions 2 and 5. So secret: ? A ? ? E.

Second guess: raise -> 
R at position 1 -> marked present but not position 1 -> so R is present but not at 1. 
A at position 2 -> we expected ✓ but got (-). What does this mean? It means the A is present, but not at position 2? But we know that in secret, position 2 is A. So it should be correct.

This is confusing. Unless the secret word has letter A elsewhere, but not at position 2? But the first guess told us A is at position 2.

So I think there's an error. Perhaps in the input, the feedback was miswritten.

Alternatively, let's consider if the secret word has only one A? Then in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct.

I think we have to assume the feedback is as provided, so we must resolve the conflict.

Another thought: Maybe the secret word has the letter A but not at position 2? But the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2, which means the secret has A at position 2.

Therefore, the second feedback saying A(-) at position 2 is impossible. This must be a mistake. I should consider that the A is actually misplaced in the context of the second guess? But no, because the first guess fixed it.

Let me read the first feedback: ""A(✓)"" for crane at position 2, so secret position 2 is A.

Second guess: at position 2, we have A again. So it should be ✓. But it is reported as A(-), which is a minus.

This seems like an error. Perhaps I should proceed with the given feedback and reinterpret.

Given feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: raise -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we have E(✓) in both, so at least position 5 is E.

Now, position 2: we have conflicting information. From guess 1, A is correct at position 2. In guess 2, A is at position 2 but now marked as (-), meaning it is present elsewhere but not at position 2? That would mean the secret does not have A at position 2? But then the first feedback was wrong.

This inconsistency cannot be resolved. Perhaps the secret word has two A's? And the position 2 is A in secret, but the second time we guess A at position 2, but if secret has two A's, it should still be correctly placed? Unless the feedback for duplicate letters is handled specially? But usually, in Wordle-style games, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might show only one correct or something? But typically, if you guess a letter in the correct position, it gets ✓, regardless of duplicates.

But in this case, position 2 must be A. So why in guess 2 we got A(-)? It doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the first guess feedback was misinterpreted. Feedback for ""crane"" said A(✓) at position 2? So we are sure.

The only explanation is that the secret word has changed? Or there is a bug? But per rules, it's the same secret word.

I think I should proceed with what is given: so let's gather what we know:

From guess 1:
  C: x
  R: - → implies R is in the word, not at position 2 (where it was guessed).
  A: ✓ at position 2 → so secret: position 2 is A.
  N: x
  E: ✓ at position 5 → secret: position 5 is E.

So secret pattern: _ A _ _ E
R is in the word but not at position 2, so at position 1, 3, or 4.

From guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: - → R is present but not at position 1? So not at 1.
    Combined with above, R must be at position 3 or 4.
  A: - → but wait, this is the problem. If secret position 2 is A, then our A at position 2 should be ✓. But we got - (“in the word but wrong position”). This means that the letter at position 2 in secret is not A? But from first guess, it is A. Unless the first feedback was wrong? It can’t be.

Another interpretation: feedback for A in guess 2 is (-), which means it is in the word but not at position 2? Which would imply that secret position 2 is not A? But then the first feedback A(✓) would mean something else? That’s impossible.

Let me read the rules: after each guess, feedback tells for each letter:
  ✓: correct letter and correct position.
  -: letter is in the word but not this position.
  x: letter not in the word.

In guess 1, for ""crane"", position 2 (which is R) got a minus, and position ? which is A — wait, let's break down guess 1:

c r a n e
positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

Feedback:
C(1):x, R(2):- that means R is present but not at position 2.
A(3):✓ → secret has A at position 3? Wait a minute! I think I made a critical mistake.

Oh no! In the first guess, the guess ""crane"" has letters at positions:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: N
5: E

Feedback: 
- C(1): x
- R(2): - → means R is in secret but not at position 2
- A(3): ✓ → means A is in secret and at position 3
- N(4): x
- E(5): ✓ → means E is in secret and at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A at position 3 (since A in guess position 3 got ✓)
- E at position 5 (✓)
- R is present but not at position 2 (in fact, not at position 2 of the secret either? But it doesn't tell us the position, only that the guess position 2 is wrong)

So secret pattern: P1 unknown, P2 unknown, P3=A, P4 unknown, P5=E.

This is a big mistake in my earlier reasoning. I incorrectly assumed the positions.

So to summarize:
- From guess 1: 
  - Secret's position 3 is A (because our A at position 3 was ✓)
  - Secret's position 5 is E (✓)
  - R is in the word, but not at the position we guessed it (position 2) -> so secret has R but not at position 2? It could be at position 1,3,4 but position 3 is A, so not position 3. So R must be at position 1 or 4? Or position 4? Let's list positions we know:
      Position 3: A
      Position 5: E
      So possible positions for R: 1, 4

But we can also have R at position 4? And at position 1? It's either or both? We don't know.

- C, N: absent.

Secret pattern: _ _ A _ E

Now, guess 2: ""raise"":
- Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
Feedback:
  R(1):- → R is present, but not at position 1. So secret has R, but not at position 1.
  A(2):- → A is present, but not at position 2. But we know secret has A at position 3, which is not position 2, so this makes sense: A is in the word, but at a different position (which we know is position 3).
  I(3):x → I is absent.
  S(4):- → S is present, but not at position 4.
  E(5):✓ → E is correct at position 5 (as we know).

We already knew E is at position 5, so no new info.

Now, combining:
From guess 1: R is present, not at position 2 (guessed position).
From guess 2: R is present, not at position 1 (guessed). So R cannot be at position 1 or 2. But secret positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> position 3 is A, not available. Position 5 is E, not available. So R must be at position 4? Or there are duplicates? For example, if secret has two R's? But we don't know yet.

Also, S is present but not at position 4.

Also, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, I

Now, secret pattern: positions:
Pos1: unknown
Pos2: unknown
Pos3: A
Pos4: must contain R or S? Or R and S? But we don't know.

We know R is present and not in position 1 or 2. Position 3 is A, position 5 is E. So R must be at position 4? Because position 4 is the only one left? Unless there is another position? Positions available for R: only position 4? Or could there be duplicate letters? For example, if the secret has R at position 4, and also at position 1? But we got R(1):- meaning that position 1 is not R? So no duplicate R at position 1? And feedback for R doesn't reveal duplicates.

But since R(1) was marked present but wrong position, it implies there is at least one R elsewhere. Since positions 1 and 2 are not R per feedbacks, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so R must be at position 4.

Similarly, S is present but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1 or 2.

From guess 1, R was guessed at position 2 and marked -, and also R is at position 4 in secret? Yes.

From guess 2, S is guessed at position 4 and marked -, so S is not at position 4. Since position 3 is A and position 5 is E, S must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, note that in guess 1, we didn't have S, so no conflict.

Summary:
- Secret: letter1: something (S or other)
- letter2: something (or S)
- letter3: A
- letter4: R   (since it must be there; see above)
- letter5: E

Also, present letters: R (at pos4), S (at pos1 or 2), A (pos3), E (pos5)
Absent: C, N, I

From guess 2, A is present and was guessed at position 2 but is actually at position 3, so minus, makes sense.

S is present but not at pos4, so in secret S must be at position 1 or 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ ? A R E, where _ can be S or other? But we know S is present, so either at 1 or 2.

But not necessarily S is at 1 or 2; it could also be that secret has S at a position we haven't guessed, but in the secret positions, only pos1 and pos2 are available for S? Because pos3,4,5 are filled: A at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

Yes: secret: 
  pos1: ?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: A
  pos4: R
  pos5: E

S is in the secret, but not at pos4 (where we guessed S). So S must be at pos1 or pos2? That's the only places.

Now, at pos1: letter, which could be S? Or at pos2: which could be S? But not both? Or could be duplicate S? Possible, but let's see.

So secret pattern: [S?] [S?] A R E

We know S is one of the first two letters? Or could be at pos1 and/or pos2.

We also know that there might be one or two S.

But we should try to find a word that matches: _ _ A R E, with S in the first or second position, and the other position to be filled.

But what are the possibilities?

Common words ending with ""ARE"" but not at the end: the word is ?? ARE -> five letters, so first two letters followed by ""ARE"".

Words: 
- STARE: S T A R E -> then pos1=S, pos2=T, pos3=A, pos4=R, pos5=E -> note S at position 1, T at 2.
- SCARE: but C is absent -> no
- SNARE: N is absent -> no
- SHARE: H unknown -> possible
- SPARE: P unknown -> possible
- STARE: as above
- SWARE: not common

Also: 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> pos1=G, pos2=L, then ARE -> does not have S? Unless S is at pos1? But if secret word is GLARE, it doesn't have S? But we know S is present.

So must have S and R and A and E.

Words with pattern: 
- If S is at pos1: then the word looks like S? ARE → e.g., STARE, SHARE, SPARE, etc.
- If S is at pos2: then the pattern is ? S ARE → e.g., US ARE -> but ""USARE"" is not a word, or ?SARE? -> 5 letter words: maybe ASHRE? no. Common words? 

""USHER"" not fit. Perhaps ""TSARE"": t s a r e? Tsare is a word? I think it's ""tsar"" but tsare? Not common.

Other possibilities: ?SARE: CSARE? C is absent. NSARE? N absent. So not many.

Therefore, it's more likely that S is at position 1: so words like STARE, SHARE, SPARE.

But we need to check with previous feedback.

We also need to avoid C and N and I.

So our next guess:

We can try to be systematic: we want to guess one of the possibilities: STARE, SHARE, SPARE, for example.

But we might also get feedback about other letters.

Let's consider: if we guess ""STARE"":

- S at pos1: secret has S at either pos1 or pos2. If secret has S at pos1, then S should be marked ✓? Otherwise, -?
- How: If secret has S at pos1, then our S at pos1 should be ✓.
- If secret has S at pos2, then our S at pos1 is present but not here? But in ""STARE"", S is at pos1, so if secret has S at pos2, then we get S(-) meaning it's present but not at pos1.

Similarly, T at pos2: unknown.

But in secret, position 2: could be S or other.

We also know that S is present in secret.

But to save guesses, we can guess ""STARE"":

- If the feedback gives S as ✓, then S is at pos1 and we have pattern S T A R E? But T might be wrong.
- Or if S is -, then S is at pos2.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, total 6 tries, we used 2.

But guessing ""STARE"" might resolve.

However, if we guess ""STARE"" and it's not the word, we get more feedback.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses new letters to test more.

For example, avoid repeating letters? But we have to include S? We can skip S? Or are there other constraints?

Another idea: include another common letter.

But to be efficient, let's list what we need to know: position 1 and position 2, one of which is S? Or both?

But since S is present, and not at pos4, and only pos1 and 2 available, then one of those is S? But there could be duplicates? For example, secret word ""SKATE"" doesn’t fit because K not S and T? But no: pattern must be ? ? A R E.

Let's think of words:

Examples::
- ""SPARE"": S P A R E -> if secret is this, then S at pos1.
- ""STARE"": S T A R E
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SWARE"": S W A R E, but WARE at end, valid? Yes.
- Also: ""SCORE"": C absent -> invalid
- ""SNORE"": N absent -> invalid
- ""GLARE"": G L A R E -> but does it have S? No.

""PARSE"": P A R S E -> pattern is P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but we know secret pos3 is A? But that would be position 3? In ""PARSE"", pos3 is R -> but our secret must have A at pos3, and R at pos4. So ""PARSE"" doesn't fit because it has R at pos3? So only words with A at pos3 and R at pos4.

So possible 5-letter words: [letter1][letter2]A R E

With S one of letter1 or letter2.

Now, letter1 and letter2: one is S? Or not necessarily. Actually, S must be at letter1 or letter2 because those are the only positions left.

So the first two letters include S and one other letter.

Common words: 
spare: S at1
stare: S at1
share: S at1
snare: not possible (N)
sward: not ARE pattern.

If S at pos2: 
Then words: ? S A R E -> for example, TSARE? Not common. 
Or DSARE? Not valid.
USARE? Not a word.
So no common words with S at position 2. 

Therefore, S must be at position 1.

So secret word is S _ A R E, with the second letter to be identified.

Common words: SPARE, STARE, SHARE, SWARE, etc.

Now, we know that C, N, I are absent.

So:
spare: P unknown
stare: T unknown
share: H unknown
sware: W unknown
Others: ""scare"" invalid (C), ""snare"" invalid (N).

We can guess ""STARE"": tests T.

But let's see the remaining letters.

Since we have one of the words, we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only unknown at position 2.

So I'll choose ""STARE"" as it is a common word.

Thus, guess.

But if I guess ""STARE"", then:

- If secret is ""SPARE"", then S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) -> T marked x?
- If secret is ""STARE"", then all ✓.

Either way, we get information.

But we have sufficient information if we get the feedback.

So let's guess ""STARE"".

But we need to choose a word that is valid. Assume all above are valid.

So I'll go with ""STARE"".

Feedback for STARE might tell us the second letter.

But in the context, let's do.

Another thought: in guess 2, we are told that S is present but not at pos4. Since we guess S at pos4, but it was not there. But now the secret must have S at pos1 (since common words support that).

Therefore, our next guess: STARE.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C (position 1): **x** → Absent, so eliminate C.
   - R (position 2): **-** → R is in the word but not at position 2.
   - A (position 3): **✓** → A is correct at position 3. Secret must have A at position 3.
   - N (position 4): **x** → Absent, so eliminate N.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → E is correct at position 5. Secret must have E at position 5.
   
   **Secret pattern so far:** `_ _ A _ E`  
   **Known letters:** R is present (but not at position 2), A at position 3, E at position 5.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""raise""):**
   - R (position 1): **-** → R is present but not at position 1.  
     Combined with Guess 1 (R not at position 2), R must be at position 4 (since position 3 is A and position 5 is E).
   - A (position 2): **-** → A is present but not at position 2. This is consistent, as A is fixed at position 3.
   - I (position 3): **x** → Absent, so eliminate I.
   - S (position 4): **-** → S is present but not at position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is now revealed as R, S must be at position 1 or 2.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → Confirms E at position 5.

   **Updated secret pattern:** `_ _ A R E`  
   **Known letters:**  
     - Position 3: A  
     - Position 4: R  
     - Position 5: E  
     - S is present at position 1 or 2.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N, I.

**Inference:**  
The secret word is `[letter1] [letter2] A R E`, where:  
- `letter1` or `letter2` must be S (since S is present and only positions 1 and 2 are open).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include **STARE**, **SHARE**, **SPARE**, or **SWARE**.  
- Given absent letters (C, N, I), **STARE** is a strong candidate: it tests S at position 1 and introduces T at position 2.  

**Next guess:**  
Guess **""stare""** to:  
- Confirm S at position 1 (if ✓, S is correct; if -, S must be at position 2).  
- Test T as a new letter.",Guess 3: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,share,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: - -> in the word but wrong position
- A: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so A is the second letter in the secret word)
- N: x -> not in the word
- E: ✓ -> correct letter and position (so E is the fifth letter in the secret word)

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is _ A _ _ E.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the first position (since our R was in the second position of ""crane"" but got moved, and we now know position 2 is A). So R is in the word, but somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Letters C and N are not in the word.

We should now guess a word that:
- Has A as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- Includes the letter R (because we know R is present) but not in the second position (which is taken by A) and not in the fifth (which is E). So R should be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoids using the letters C and N (since they are absent).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ A _ _ E.

We also know that the word must include R (somewhere in positions 1,3,4). Let's consider common letters.

Possible words: 
- RAISE: R A I S E -> This has A in second, E at fifth. Also includes R at first. But we have to check the feedback for other letters later.
But note: we haven't tried S or I yet. 

We can also think of other words like ""RAZED"", ""RAPED"", ""RARED"", etc., but we must use valid English words.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests other common consonants to gather more information.

However, since we already know A and E are fixed, and R is present, we can focus on placing R and finding the other letters.

But remember: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got a minus, meaning in the secret word R is not at position 2 (which we already know because position 2 is A) and also not at position 1? Wait, not necessarily. The feedback only tells us it's present but not at the guessed position. So R could be at position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to list words matching _ A _ _ E that contain R and avoid C,N.

Some options:
- RANGE: has A in second, E at fifth. But contains N which we know is absent -> invalid.
- RAREE: not common, and double R? Also E at fifth, but second letter A? No, R A R E E -> but that's not 5 distinct? Anyway, R in first and third. But we have no info on double letters? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? Our feedback wouldn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess them.

But note: our feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it showed as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two R's, then we might have more than one R marked? But in this case, we only have one R in the guess and one mark. So we don't know.

We must avoid N and C.

Another word: ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E: 
- Positions: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.
- This meets the pattern and includes R in position 1.

Also, we can try ""RAZE"": but that's 4 letters. Not 5.

""RATED"": T and D are new letters. Pattern: R A T E D -> fifth letter is D, not E -> doesn't meet pattern (must be E at fifth). 

""RAZED"": R A Z E D -> fifth is D -> not E.

It has to end with E. So:

Other options: 
  ""RAPED"" -> R A P E D: fifth letter D -> invalid.

We need fifth letter E.

Valid: 
  ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E
  ""PRASE"" -> P R A S E: but note the pattern is P at first, then R at second? But our pattern must be A at second. In ""PRASE"", the second letter is R -> not A? So no.

We must have second letter A and fifth E.

How about: ""BRAVE""? Let's see: B R A V E -> second letter R? But we need A at second -> no.

Wait, we must have the second position as A and fifth as E.

So: 
  Position 1: ? 
  Position 2: A 
  Position 3: ? 
  Position 4: ? 
  Position 5: E 

And the word contains R (somewhere in 1,3,4).

Possible words:

- R A ? ? E: e.g., ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E), ""RAMIE"" (R-A-M-I-E), ""RACEY"" (but C is absent -> invalid), ""RARED"" (R-A-R-E-D -> fifth letter D, invalid) etc.

After avoiding C and N, let's try:

- ""RAISE"": R A I S E -> might be a candidate.
- ""RABBE"": not a common word? Invalid.

Maybe we can include other common letters that haven't been tested: like S, T, L, etc.

But note: we have two positions to fill: 1,3,4 but actually position 1 is open? Wait, we don't know position 1. Since R could be in position 1, but it might not.

We also know R is present, but it might not be in the first position.

So another possibility: the R in the secret word is not in position 1? Then the word could have R in position 3 or 4.

For example: 
  ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> but fifth letter E? Yes: G at fourth, E at fifth -> so BARGE: positions B A R G E. 
  This has A at second, E at fifth, and R at third. Also avoids C and N.

Another: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at second, E at fifth? S is at fourth -> P A R S E -> yes, and R at third.

Another: ""TARSE"": not common.

Or ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> similar to BARGE.

And ""MARVE"": not common.

Also ""WARRE"": not common.

So among common words: RAISE, BARGE, PARSE, LARGE, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In RAISE: letters R, A, I, S, E -> we already know A, E, and R. So only I and S are new. And we can see if R is in position 1.

In BARGE: letters B, A, R, G, E -> we know A, R, E, but B and G are new. R is in position 3.

Similarly, PARSE has P, A, R, S, E -> P and S are new.

We also have 5 tries left? Actually, this is our second guess.

But to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't necessarily include R, but wait: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it? Actually no. We are allowed to guess words without R? But we know R is present, so if we don't include R, we might get feedback that misses that. However, the rules don't require including known letters, but it's efficient to do so.

But we have fixed A at 2 and E at 5, so the pattern is _ A _ _ E.

And we must avoid C and N.

I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses R at first and then tests I and S. Also, it's a common word.

But note: if the secret word were, say, ""BARGE"", then guessing ""RAISE"" would give us some feedback:

But let's see what feedback we would get if secret word is BARGE and we guess RAISE:

- R: in BARGE? R is in position 3 -> so our guess R at position1: wrong position? So we would get R(-) -> because R is in the word but not at position 1.
- A: correct position -> A(✓)
- I: not in BARGE -> I(x)
- S: not in BARGE -> S(x)
- E: correct position -> E(✓)

But that doesn't help us much? But we don't know the secret word. However, we are trying to gather more letters.

Alternatively, if we guess BARGE:

And the secret word might be something else.

But we don't know. So I think ""RAISE"" is a reasonable guess.

Another idea: we can use a word that has R and other common letters and avoids repeating known letters.

But let me list some other words that fit: LARGE, BARGE, PARSE, FARSE? (invalid), MARSE? (invalid). Also, ""CARLE"" -> C is absent -> invalid. So not many.

Also: ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> but we know A and E. S and T are new. But does it contain R? No, but we know R is present. So if we guess PASTE, it doesn't include R, so we might expect:
- P: unknown
- A: correct ✓
- S: unknown
- T: unknown
- E: correct ✓

And then R would not be in the guess, so we might get a minus for R? Wait, but R is present, so the feedback would show that we are missing R? It does: because R is in the word but not in the guess, so we wouldn't get any indication? Actually, no: the feedback per letter only applies to the letters we guessed. So if we don't guess R, we don't get any feedback about R. But we know from the first guess that there is an R? But we haven't placed it.

To avoid wasting a guess, we should include R.

So back to including R.

Therefore, I choose ""RAISE"". It places R at the first position which we don't know, but we know R is elsewhere if not.

Thus, guess: RAISE.

<guess>raise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **absent** (x).  
- R is **present but not in position 2** (-), since position 2 is now confirmed as A (✓).  
- A is in the **correct position (2)** (✓).  
- E is in the **correct position (5)** (✓).  

The secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? E**, and contains the letter **R** (in positions 1, 3, or 4).   
C and N are eliminated.  

For the second guess:  
- Prioritize words matching **? A ? ? E** and including **R** (but not in position 2).  
- Test new common letters (avoid C and N) to gather more information.  
- ""RAISE"" fits:  
  - Ends in E (position 5 ✓).  
  - Second letter A (position 2 ✓).  
  - Includes R (tests position 1).  
  - Introduces new letters **I** and **S** for coverage.  

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities (e.g., BARGE, PARSE, LARGE) while leveraging known constraints.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the two guesses:

From Guess 1 (""crane""): 
  C: absent (x)
  R: present, but not in position 2 (-) -> since guessed in position 2, but actually position 2 in secret is A (we know that because A was correct). So R is elsewhere.
  A: correct at position 2 (✓)
  N: absent (x)
  E: correct at position 5 (✓)

So we know: 
  Secret word pattern: _ A _ _ E
  R is present but not at position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4)
  Absent letters: C, N

From Guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: present but not at position 1 (-) -> so R is not at position 1. Combined with first guess, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 is A).
  A: present but not at position 2 (-) -> wait, but we already know A is fixed at position 2? How can A be present but wrong position? 
      This is a conflict because we know from the first guess that A is at position 2. So what does this mean?

Let me interpret: 
  In ""raise"", the A is at position 2. But the feedback says A(-), meaning present but not at this position? 
  However, we already have A fixed at position 2 from the first guess. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓? 
  This suggests an issue. Let me reread.

Wait, the secret word has A at position 2. In ""raise"", we have A at position 2, so it must be correct. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓, not (-). 
But the feedback we got is: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓). That says A is present but not at position 2? 
This is impossible because we know position 2 is A and we are guessing position 2 as A.

There might be a misunderstanding? Let me double-check the example. In the example, in guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) ... meaning correctly positioned.

So for a letter that is correctly positioned, we should get ✓. 
Therefore, in ""raise"", since we know position 2 is A, and we put A at position 2, it must be ✓.

But the feedback says A(-). This is inconsistent with the rules.

Alternatively, there might be a typo in the user message? Or an error in my reasoning.

Wait, note: the feedback we got: 
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we know from the first guess that:
- Position 2: A (correct) -> so the secret word has A at position 2.
- Position 5: E (correct) -> secret has E at position 5.

So in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct, so why is it marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position?

This implies that the secret word does not actually have A at position 2? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Unless the secret word changed? But the rules say one secret word.

This seems like a discrepancy. Let me re-read the first feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

Here, A and E are marked correct. So A is at position 2 of the secret word, E at position 5.

So in the second guess, ""raise"":
- Position 1: R -> gets (-), meaning R is present but not at position 1.
- Position 2: A -> should be ✓, but gets (-)? This can't be.

Therefore, I suspect a typo in the feedback. Could it be that the feedback for A is ✓? Let me consider:

Perhaps the feedback format: It says ""A(-)"" but maybe it's a mistake?

Another possibility: maybe the secret word has two A's? For example, maybe the word is like ""TASER"" or ""PARSE""? 

But let's look: First guess: crane -> A and E are correct at positions 2 and 5. So secret: ? A ? ? E.

Second guess: raise -> 
R at position 1 -> marked present but not position 1 -> so R is present but not at 1. 
A at position 2 -> we expected ✓ but got (-). What does this mean? It means the A is present, but not at position 2? But we know that in secret, position 2 is A. So it should be correct.

This is confusing. Unless the secret word has letter A elsewhere, but not at position 2? But the first guess told us A is at position 2.

So I think there's an error. Perhaps in the input, the feedback was miswritten.

Alternatively, let's consider if the secret word has only one A? Then in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct.

I think we have to assume the feedback is as provided, so we must resolve the conflict.

Another thought: Maybe the secret word has the letter A but not at position 2? But the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2, which means the secret has A at position 2.

Therefore, the second feedback saying A(-) at position 2 is impossible. This must be a mistake. I should consider that the A is actually misplaced in the context of the second guess? But no, because the first guess fixed it.

Let me read the first feedback: ""A(✓)"" for crane at position 2, so secret position 2 is A.

Second guess: at position 2, we have A again. So it should be ✓. But it is reported as A(-), which is a minus.

This seems like an error. Perhaps I should proceed with the given feedback and reinterpret.

Given feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: raise -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)

But we have E(✓) in both, so at least position 5 is E.

Now, position 2: we have conflicting information. From guess 1, A is correct at position 2. In guess 2, A is at position 2 but now marked as (-), meaning it is present elsewhere but not at position 2? That would mean the secret does not have A at position 2? But then the first feedback was wrong.

This inconsistency cannot be resolved. Perhaps the secret word has two A's? And the position 2 is A in secret, but the second time we guess A at position 2, but if secret has two A's, it should still be correctly placed? Unless the feedback for duplicate letters is handled specially? But usually, in Wordle-style games, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might show only one correct or something? But typically, if you guess a letter in the correct position, it gets ✓, regardless of duplicates.

But in this case, position 2 must be A. So why in guess 2 we got A(-)? It doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the first guess feedback was misinterpreted. Feedback for ""crane"" said A(✓) at position 2? So we are sure.

The only explanation is that the secret word has changed? Or there is a bug? But per rules, it's the same secret word.

I think I should proceed with what is given: so let's gather what we know:

From guess 1:
  C: x
  R: - → implies R is in the word, not at position 2 (where it was guessed).
  A: ✓ at position 2 → so secret: position 2 is A.
  N: x
  E: ✓ at position 5 → secret: position 5 is E.

So secret pattern: _ A _ _ E
R is in the word but not at position 2, so at position 1, 3, or 4.

From guess 2 (""raise""):
  R: - → R is present but not at position 1? So not at 1.
    Combined with above, R must be at position 3 or 4.
  A: - → but wait, this is the problem. If secret position 2 is A, then our A at position 2 should be ✓. But we got - (“in the word but wrong position”). This means that the letter at position 2 in secret is not A? But from first guess, it is A. Unless the first feedback was wrong? It can’t be.

Another interpretation: feedback for A in guess 2 is (-), which means it is in the word but not at position 2? Which would imply that secret position 2 is not A? But then the first feedback A(✓) would mean something else? That’s impossible.

Let me read the rules: after each guess, feedback tells for each letter:
  ✓: correct letter and correct position.
  -: letter is in the word but not this position.
  x: letter not in the word.

In guess 1, for ""crane"", position 2 (which is R) got a minus, and position ? which is A — wait, let's break down guess 1:

c r a n e
positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E

Feedback:
C(1):x, R(2):- that means R is present but not at position 2.
A(3):✓ → secret has A at position 3? Wait a minute! I think I made a critical mistake.

Oh no! In the first guess, the guess ""crane"" has letters at positions:
1: C
2: R
3: A
4: N
5: E

Feedback: 
- C(1): x
- R(2): - → means R is in secret but not at position 2
- A(3): ✓ → means A is in secret and at position 3
- N(4): x
- E(5): ✓ → means E is in secret and at position 5

Therefore, the secret word has:
- A at position 3 (since A in guess position 3 got ✓)
- E at position 5 (✓)
- R is present but not at position 2 (in fact, not at position 2 of the secret either? But it doesn't tell us the position, only that the guess position 2 is wrong)

So secret pattern: P1 unknown, P2 unknown, P3=A, P4 unknown, P5=E.

This is a big mistake in my earlier reasoning. I incorrectly assumed the positions.

So to summarize:
- From guess 1: 
  - Secret's position 3 is A (because our A at position 3 was ✓)
  - Secret's position 5 is E (✓)
  - R is in the word, but not at the position we guessed it (position 2) -> so secret has R but not at position 2? It could be at position 1,3,4 but position 3 is A, so not position 3. So R must be at position 1 or 4? Or position 4? Let's list positions we know:
      Position 3: A
      Position 5: E
      So possible positions for R: 1, 4

But we can also have R at position 4? And at position 1? It's either or both? We don't know.

- C, N: absent.

Secret pattern: _ _ A _ E

Now, guess 2: ""raise"":
- Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E
Feedback:
  R(1):- → R is present, but not at position 1. So secret has R, but not at position 1.
  A(2):- → A is present, but not at position 2. But we know secret has A at position 3, which is not position 2, so this makes sense: A is in the word, but at a different position (which we know is position 3).
  I(3):x → I is absent.
  S(4):- → S is present, but not at position 4.
  E(5):✓ → E is correct at position 5 (as we know).

We already knew E is at position 5, so no new info.

Now, combining:
From guess 1: R is present, not at position 2 (guessed position).
From guess 2: R is present, not at position 1 (guessed). So R cannot be at position 1 or 2. But secret positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> position 3 is A, not available. Position 5 is E, not available. So R must be at position 4? Or there are duplicates? For example, if secret has two R's? But we don't know yet.

Also, S is present but not at position 4.

Also, we know:
- Absent letters: C, N, I

Now, secret pattern: positions:
Pos1: unknown
Pos2: unknown
Pos3: A
Pos4: must contain R or S? Or R and S? But we don't know.

We know R is present and not in position 1 or 2. Position 3 is A, position 5 is E. So R must be at position 4? Because position 4 is the only one left? Unless there is another position? Positions available for R: only position 4? Or could there be duplicate letters? For example, if the secret has R at position 4, and also at position 1? But we got R(1):- meaning that position 1 is not R? So no duplicate R at position 1? And feedback for R doesn't reveal duplicates.

But since R(1) was marked present but wrong position, it implies there is at least one R elsewhere. Since positions 1 and 2 are not R per feedbacks, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so R must be at position 4.

Similarly, S is present but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1 or 2.

From guess 1, R was guessed at position 2 and marked -, and also R is at position 4 in secret? Yes.

From guess 2, S is guessed at position 4 and marked -, so S is not at position 4. Since position 3 is A and position 5 is E, S must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, note that in guess 1, we didn't have S, so no conflict.

Summary:
- Secret: letter1: something (S or other)
- letter2: something (or S)
- letter3: A
- letter4: R   (since it must be there; see above)
- letter5: E

Also, present letters: R (at pos4), S (at pos1 or 2), A (pos3), E (pos5)
Absent: C, N, I

From guess 2, A is present and was guessed at position 2 but is actually at position 3, so minus, makes sense.

S is present but not at pos4, so in secret S must be at position 1 or 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits: _ ? A R E, where _ can be S or other? But we know S is present, so either at 1 or 2.

But not necessarily S is at 1 or 2; it could also be that secret has S at a position we haven't guessed, but in the secret positions, only pos1 and pos2 are available for S? Because pos3,4,5 are filled: A at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

Yes: secret: 
  pos1: ?
  pos2: ?
  pos3: A
  pos4: R
  pos5: E

S is in the secret, but not at pos4 (where we guessed S). So S must be at pos1 or pos2? That's the only places.

Now, at pos1: letter, which could be S? Or at pos2: which could be S? But not both? Or could be duplicate S? Possible, but let's see.

So secret pattern: [S?] [S?] A R E

We know S is one of the first two letters? Or could be at pos1 and/or pos2.

We also know that there might be one or two S.

But we should try to find a word that matches: _ _ A R E, with S in the first or second position, and the other position to be filled.

But what are the possibilities?

Common words ending with ""ARE"" but not at the end: the word is ?? ARE -> five letters, so first two letters followed by ""ARE"".

Words: 
- STARE: S T A R E -> then pos1=S, pos2=T, pos3=A, pos4=R, pos5=E -> note S at position 1, T at 2.
- SCARE: but C is absent -> no
- SNARE: N is absent -> no
- SHARE: H unknown -> possible
- SPARE: P unknown -> possible
- STARE: as above
- SWARE: not common

Also: 
- GLARE: G L A R E -> pos1=G, pos2=L, then ARE -> does not have S? Unless S is at pos1? But if secret word is GLARE, it doesn't have S? But we know S is present.

So must have S and R and A and E.

Words with pattern: 
- If S is at pos1: then the word looks like S? ARE → e.g., STARE, SHARE, SPARE, etc.
- If S is at pos2: then the pattern is ? S ARE → e.g., US ARE -> but ""USARE"" is not a word, or ?SARE? -> 5 letter words: maybe ASHRE? no. Common words? 

""USHER"" not fit. Perhaps ""TSARE"": t s a r e? Tsare is a word? I think it's ""tsar"" but tsare? Not common.

Other possibilities: ?SARE: CSARE? C is absent. NSARE? N absent. So not many.

Therefore, it's more likely that S is at position 1: so words like STARE, SHARE, SPARE.

But we need to check with previous feedback.

We also need to avoid C and N and I.

So our next guess:

We can try to be systematic: we want to guess one of the possibilities: STARE, SHARE, SPARE, for example.

But we might also get feedback about other letters.

Let's consider: if we guess ""STARE"":

- S at pos1: secret has S at either pos1 or pos2. If secret has S at pos1, then S should be marked ✓? Otherwise, -?
- How: If secret has S at pos1, then our S at pos1 should be ✓.
- If secret has S at pos2, then our S at pos1 is present but not here? But in ""STARE"", S is at pos1, so if secret has S at pos2, then we get S(-) meaning it's present but not at pos1.

Similarly, T at pos2: unknown.

But in secret, position 2: could be S or other.

We also know that S is present in secret.

But to save guesses, we can guess ""STARE"":

- If the feedback gives S as ✓, then S is at pos1 and we have pattern S T A R E? But T might be wrong.
- Or if S is -, then S is at pos2.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, total 6 tries, we used 2.

But guessing ""STARE"" might resolve.

However, if we guess ""STARE"" and it's not the word, we get more feedback.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses new letters to test more.

For example, avoid repeating letters? But we have to include S? We can skip S? Or are there other constraints?

Another idea: include another common letter.

But to be efficient, let's list what we need to know: position 1 and position 2, one of which is S? Or both?

But since S is present, and not at pos4, and only pos1 and 2 available, then one of those is S? But there could be duplicates? For example, secret word ""SKATE"" doesn’t fit because K not S and T? But no: pattern must be ? ? A R E.

Let's think of words:

Examples::
- ""SPARE"": S P A R E -> if secret is this, then S at pos1.
- ""STARE"": S T A R E
- ""SHARE"": S H A R E
- ""SWARE"": S W A R E, but WARE at end, valid? Yes.
- Also: ""SCORE"": C absent -> invalid
- ""SNORE"": N absent -> invalid
- ""GLARE"": G L A R E -> but does it have S? No.

""PARSE"": P A R S E -> pattern is P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but we know secret pos3 is A? But that would be position 3? In ""PARSE"", pos3 is R -> but our secret must have A at pos3, and R at pos4. So ""PARSE"" doesn't fit because it has R at pos3? So only words with A at pos3 and R at pos4.

So possible 5-letter words: [letter1][letter2]A R E

With S one of letter1 or letter2.

Now, letter1 and letter2: one is S? Or not necessarily. Actually, S must be at letter1 or letter2 because those are the only positions left.

So the first two letters include S and one other letter.

Common words: 
spare: S at1
stare: S at1
share: S at1
snare: not possible (N)
sward: not ARE pattern.

If S at pos2: 
Then words: ? S A R E -> for example, TSARE? Not common. 
Or DSARE? Not valid.
USARE? Not a word.
So no common words with S at position 2. 

Therefore, S must be at position 1.

So secret word is S _ A R E, with the second letter to be identified.

Common words: SPARE, STARE, SHARE, SWARE, etc.

Now, we know that C, N, I are absent.

So:
spare: P unknown
stare: T unknown
share: H unknown
sware: W unknown
Others: ""scare"" invalid (C), ""snare"" invalid (N).

We can guess ""STARE"": tests T.

But let's see the remaining letters.

Since we have one of the words, we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only unknown at position 2.

So I'll choose ""STARE"" as it is a common word.

Thus, guess.

But if I guess ""STARE"", then:

- If secret is ""SPARE"", then S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) -> T marked x?
- If secret is ""STARE"", then all ✓.

Either way, we get information.

But we have sufficient information if we get the feedback.

So let's guess ""STARE"".

But we need to choose a word that is valid. Assume all above are valid.

So I'll go with ""STARE"".

Feedback for STARE might tell us the second letter.

But in the context, let's do.

Another thought: in guess 2, we are told that S is present but not at pos4. Since we guess S at pos4, but it was not there. But now the secret must have S at pos1 (since common words support that).

Therefore, our next guess: STARE.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**
   - C (position 1): **x** → Absent, so eliminate C.
   - R (position 2): **-** → R is in the word but not at position 2.
   - A (position 3): **✓** → A is correct at position 3. Secret must have A at position 3.
   - N (position 4): **x** → Absent, so eliminate N.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → E is correct at position 5. Secret must have E at position 5.
   
   **Secret pattern so far:** `_ _ A _ E`  
   **Known letters:** R is present (but not at position 2), A at position 3, E at position 5.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""raise""):**
   - R (position 1): **-** → R is present but not at position 1.  
     Combined with Guess 1 (R not at position 2), R must be at position 4 (since position 3 is A and position 5 is E).
   - A (position 2): **-** → A is present but not at position 2. This is consistent, as A is fixed at position 3.
   - I (position 3): **x** → Absent, so eliminate I.
   - S (position 4): **-** → S is present but not at position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is now revealed as R, S must be at position 1 or 2.
   - E (position 5): **✓** → Confirms E at position 5.

   **Updated secret pattern:** `_ _ A R E`  
   **Known letters:**  
     - Position 3: A  
     - Position 4: R  
     - Position 5: E  
     - S is present at position 1 or 2.  
   **Absent letters:** C, N, I.

**Inference:**  
The secret word is `[letter1] [letter2] A R E`, where:  
- `letter1` or `letter2` must be S (since S is present and only positions 1 and 2 are open).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include **STARE**, **SHARE**, **SPARE**, or **SWARE**.  
- Given absent letters (C, N, I), **STARE** is a strong candidate: it tests S at position 1 and introduces T at position 2.  

**Next guess:**  
Guess **""stare""** to:  
- Confirm S at position 1 (if ✓, S is correct; if -, S must be at position 2).  
- Test T as a new letter.

Wait, not necessarily. The feedback only tells us it\'s present but not at the guessed position. So R could be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me try to list words matching _ A _ _ E that contain R and avoid C,N.\n\nSome options:\n- RANGE: has A in second, E at fifth.

But we have no info on double letters? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? Our feedback wouldn\'t tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess them.\n\nBut note: our feedback for ""crane"" had only one R and it showed as present (but wrong position). If the secret word had two R\'s, then we might have more than one R marked? But in this case, we only have one R in the guess and one mark. So we don\'t know.\n\nWe must avoid N and C.\n\nAnother word: ""RAISE"" -> R A I S E: \n- Positions: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n- This meets the pattern and includes R in position 1.\n\nAlso, we can try ""RAZE"": but that\'s 4 letters.

Let\'s see: B R A V E -> second letter R? But we need A at second -> no.\n\nWait, we must have the second position as A and fifth as E.\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: ? \n  Position 2: A \n  Position 3: ? \n  Position 4: ? \n  Position 5: E \n\nAnd the word contains R (somewhere in 1,3,4).\n\nPossible words:\n\n- R A ? ? E: e.g., ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E), ""RAMIE"" (R-A-M-I-E), ""RACEY"" (but C is absent -> invalid), ""RARED"" (R-A-R-E-D -> fifth letter D, invalid) etc.\n\nAfter avoiding C and N, let\'s try:\n\n- ""RAISE"": R A I S E -> might be a candidate.\n- ""RABBE"": not a common word? Invalid.\n\nMaybe we can include other common letters that haven\'t been tested: like S, T, L, etc.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to fill: 1,3,4 but actually position 1 is open? Wait, we don\'t know position 1. Since R could be in position 1, but it might not.\n\nWe also know R is present, but it might not be in the first position.\n\nSo another possibility: the R in the secret word is not in position 1? Then the word could have R in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example: \n  ""BARGE"": B A R G E -> but fifth letter E? Yes: G at fourth, E at fifth -> so BARGE: positions B A R G E. \n  This has A at second, E at fifth, and R at third. Also avoids C and N.\n\nAnother: ""PARSE"": P A R S E -> A at second, E at fifth? S is at fourth -> P A R S E -> yes, and R at third.\n\nAnother: ""TARSE"": not common.\n\nOr ""LARGE"": L A R G E -> similar to BARGE.\n\nAnd ""MARVE"": not common.\n\nAlso ""WARRE"": not common.\n\nSo among common words: RAISE, BARGE, PARSE, LARGE, etc.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn RAISE: letters R, A, I, S, E -> we already know A, E, and R. So only I and S are new. And we can see if R is in position 1.\n\nIn BARGE: letters B, A, R, G, E -> we know A, R, E, but B and G are new. R is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, PARSE has P, A, R, S, E -> P and S are new.\n\nWe also have 5 tries left? Actually, this is our second guess.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t necessarily include R, but wait: we know R must be in the word, so we should include it? Actually no. We are allowed to guess words without R? But we know R is present, so if we don\'t include R, we might get feedback that misses that. However, the rules don\'t require including known letters, but it\'s efficient to do so.\n\nBut we have fixed A at 2 and E at 5, so the pattern is _ A _ _ E.\n\nAnd we must avoid C and N.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses R at first and then tests I and S. Also, it\'s a common word.\n\nBut note: if the secret word were, say, ""BARGE"", then guessing ""RAISE"" would give us some feedback:\n\nBut let\'s see what feedback we would get if secret word is BARGE and we guess RAISE:\n\n- R: in BARGE? R is in position 3 -> so our guess R at position1: wrong position? So we would get R(-) -> because R is in the word but not at position 1.\n- A: correct position -> A(✓)\n- I: not in BARGE -> I(x)\n- S: not in BARGE -> S(x)\n- E: correct position -> E(✓)\n\nBut that doesn\'t help us much? But we don\'t know the secret word. However, we are trying to gather more letters.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess BARGE:\n\nAnd the secret word might be something else.\n\nBut we don\'t know. So I think ""RAISE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that has R and other common letters and avoids repeating known letters.\n\nBut let me list some other words that fit: LARGE, BARGE, PARSE, FARSE? (invalid), MARSE? (invalid). Also, ""CARLE"" -> C is absent -> invalid. So not many.\n\nAlso: ""PASTE"": P A S T E -> but we know A and E. S and T are new. But does it contain R? No, but we know R is present. So if we guess PASTE, it doesn\'t include R, so we might expect:\n- P: unknown\n- A: correct ✓\n- S: unknown\n- T: unknown\n- E: correct ✓\n\nAnd then R would not be in the guess, so we might get a minus for R? Wait, but R is present, so the feedback would show that we are missing R? It does: because R is in the word but not in the guess, so we wouldn\'t get any indication? Actually, no: the feedback per letter only applies to the letters we guessed. So if we don\'t guess R, we don\'t get any feedback about R. But we know from the first guess that there is an R? But we haven\'t placed it.\n\nTo avoid wasting a guess, we should include R.\n\nSo back to including R.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""RAISE"". It places R at the first position which we don\'t know, but we know R is elsewhere if not.\n\nThus, guess: RAISE.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and N are **absent** (x).  \n- R is **present but not in position 2** (-), since position 2 is now confirmed as A (✓).  \n- A is in the **correct position (2)** (✓).  \n- E is in the **correct position (5)** (✓).  \n\nThe secret word has the pattern: **? A ? ? E**, and contains the letter **R** (in positions 1, 3, or 4).   \nC and N are eliminated.  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Prioritize words matching **? A ? ? E** and including **R** (but not in position 2).  \n- Test new common letters (avoid C and N) to gather more information.  \n- ""RAISE"" fits:  \n  - Ends in E (position 5 ✓).  \n  - Second letter A (position 2 ✓).  \n  - Includes R (tests position 1).  \n  - Introduces new letters **I** and **S** for coverage.  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possibilities (e.g., BARGE, PARSE, LARGE) while leveraging known constraints.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""): \n  C: absent (x)\n  R: present, but not in position 2 (-) -> since guessed in position 2, but actually position 2 in secret is A (we know that because A was correct).

Combined with first guess, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 2 is A).\n  A: present but not at position 2 (-) -> wait, but we already know A is fixed at position 2? How can A be present but wrong position? \n      This is a conflict because we know from the first guess that A is at position 2. So what does this mean?\n\nLet me interpret: \n  In ""raise"", the A is at position 2. But the feedback says A(-), meaning present but not at this position? \n  However, we already have A fixed at position 2 from the first guess. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓? \n  This suggests an issue. Let me reread.\n\nWait, the secret word has A at position 2. In ""raise"", we have A at position 2, so it must be correct. Therefore, the feedback for A should be ✓, not (-). \nBut the feedback we got is: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓). That says A is present but not at position 2? \nThis is impossible because we know position 2 is A and we are guessing position 2 as A.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding? Let me double-check the example. In the example, in guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) ... meaning correctly positioned.\n\nSo for a letter that is correctly positioned, we should get ✓. \nTherefore, in ""raise"", since we know position 2 is A, and we put A at position 2, it must be ✓.\n\nBut the feedback says A(-). This is inconsistent with the rules.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a typo in the user message? Or an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, note: the feedback we got: \nGuess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\n\nBut we know from the first guess that:\n- Position 2: A (correct) -> so the secret word has A at position 2.\n- Position 5: E (correct) -> secret has E at position 5.\n\nSo in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct, so why is it marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position?\n\nThis implies that the secret word does not actually have A at position 2? But that contradicts the first feedback.\n\nUnless the secret word changed? But the rules say one secret word.\n\nThis seems like a discrepancy. Let me re-read the first feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n\nHere, A and E are marked correct. So A is at position 2 of the secret word, E at position 5.\n\nSo in the second guess, ""raise"":\n- Position 1: R -> gets (-), meaning R is present but not at position 1.\n- Position 2: A -> should be ✓, but gets (-)? This can\'t be.\n\nTherefore, I suspect a typo in the feedback. Could it be that the feedback for A is ✓? Let me consider:\n\nPerhaps the feedback format: It says ""A(-)"" but maybe it\'s a mistake?\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the secret word has two A\'s? For example, maybe the word is like ""TASER"" or ""PARSE""? \n\nBut let\'s look: First guess: crane -> A and E are correct at positions 2 and 5. So secret: ? A ? ? E.\n\nSecond guess: raise -> \nR at position 1 -> marked present but not position 1 -> so R is present but not at 1. \nA at position 2 -> we expected ✓ but got (-). What does this mean? It means the A is present, but not at position 2? But we know that in secret, position 2 is A. So it should be correct.\n\nThis is confusing. Unless the secret word has letter A elsewhere, but not at position 2? But the first guess told us A is at position 2.\n\nSo I think there\'s an error. Perhaps in the input, the feedback was miswritten.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider if the secret word has only one A? Then in the second guess, when we put A at position 2, it should be correct.\n\nI think we have to assume the feedback is as provided, so we must resolve the conflict.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the secret word has the letter A but not at position 2? But the first feedback said A(✓) at position 2, which means the secret has A at position 2.\n\nTherefore, the second feedback saying A(-) at position 2 is impossible. This must be a mistake. I should consider that the A is actually misplaced in the context of the second guess? But no, because the first guess fixed it.\n\nLet me read the first feedback: ""A(✓)"" for crane at position 2, so secret position 2 is A.\n\nSecond guess: at position 2, we have A again. So it should be ✓. But it is reported as A(-), which is a minus.\n\nThis seems like an error. Perhaps I should proceed with the given feedback and reinterpret.\n\nGiven feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: raise -> R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\n\nBut we have E(✓) in both, so at least position 5 is E.\n\nNow, position 2: we have conflicting information. From guess 1, A is correct at position 2. In guess 2, A is at position 2 but now marked as (-), meaning it is present elsewhere but not at position 2? That would mean the secret does not have A at position 2? But then the first feedback was wrong.\n\nThis inconsistency cannot be resolved. Perhaps the secret word has two A\'s? And the position 2 is A in secret, but the second time we guess A at position 2, but if secret has two A\'s, it should still be correctly placed? Unless the feedback for duplicate letters is handled specially? But usually, in Wordle-style games, if a letter is repeated, the feedback might show only one correct or something? But typically, if you guess a letter in the correct position, it gets ✓, regardless of duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, position 2 must be A. So why in guess 2 we got A(-)? It doesn\'t make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: the first guess feedback was misinterpreted. Feedback for ""crane"" said A(✓) at position 2? So we are sure.\n\nThe only explanation is that the secret word has changed? Or there is a bug? But per rules, it\'s the same secret word.\n\nI think I should proceed with what is given: so let\'s gather what we know:\n\nFrom guess 1:\n  C: x\n  R: - → implies R is in the word, not at position 2 (where it was guessed).\n  A: ✓ at position 2 → so secret: position 2 is A.\n  N: x\n  E: ✓ at position 5 → secret: position 5 is E.\n\nSo secret pattern: _ A _ _ E\nR is in the word but not at position 2, so at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFrom guess 2 (""raise""):\n  R: - → R is present but not at position 1? So not at 1.\n    Combined with above, R must be at position 3 or 4.\n  A: - → but wait, this is the problem. If secret position 2 is A, then our A at position 2 should be ✓. But we got - (“in the word but wrong position”). This means that the letter at position 2 in secret is not A? But from first guess, it is A. Unless the first feedback was wrong? It can’t be.\n\nAnother interpretation: feedback for A in guess 2 is (-), which means it is in the word but not at position 2? Which would imply that secret position 2 is not A? But then the first feedback A(✓) would mean something else? That’s impossible.\n\nLet me read the rules: after each guess, feedback tells for each letter:\n  ✓: correct letter and correct position.\n  -: letter is in the word but not this position.\n  x: letter not in the word.\n\nIn guess 1, for ""crane"", position 2 (which is R) got a minus, and position ? which is A — wait, let\'s break down guess 1:\n\nc r a n e\npositions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E\n\nFeedback:\nC(1):x, R(2):- that means R is present but not at position 2.\nA(3):✓ → secret has A at position 3? Wait a minute! I think I made a critical mistake.\n\nOh no! In the first guess, the guess ""crane"" has letters at positions:\n1: C\n2: R\n3: A\n4: N\n5: E\n\nFeedback: \n- C(1): x\n- R(2): - → means R is in secret but not at position 2\n- A(3): ✓ → means A is in secret and at position 3\n- N(4): x\n- E(5): ✓ → means E is in secret and at position 5\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- A at position 3 (since A in guess position 3 got ✓)\n- E at position 5 (✓)\n- R is present but not at position 2 (in fact, not at position 2 of the secret either? But it doesn\'t tell us the position, only that the guess position 2 is wrong)\n\nSo secret pattern: P1 unknown, P2 unknown, P3=A, P4 unknown, P5=E.\n\nThis is a big mistake in my earlier reasoning. I incorrectly assumed the positions.\n\nSo to summarize:\n- From guess 1: \n  - Secret\'s position 3 is A (because our A at position 3 was ✓)\n  - Secret\'s position 5 is E (✓)\n  - R is in the word, but not at the position we guessed it (position 2) -> so secret has R but not at position 2? It could be at position 1,3,4 but position 3 is A, so not position 3. So R must be at position 1 or 4? Or position 4? Let\'s list positions we know:\n      Position 3: A\n      Position 5: E\n      So possible positions for R: 1, 4\n\nBut we can also have R at position 4? And at position 1? It\'s either or both? We don\'t know.\n\n- C, N: absent.\n\nSecret pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nNow, guess 2: ""raise"":\n- Positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E\nFeedback:\n  R(1):- → R is present, but not at position 1. So secret has R, but not at position 1.\n  A(2):- → A is present, but not at position 2. But we know secret has A at position 3, which is not position 2, so this makes sense: A is in the word, but at a different position (which we know is position 3).\n  I(3):x → I is absent.\n  S(4):- → S is present, but not at position 4.\n  E(5):✓ → E is correct at position 5 (as we know).\n\nWe already knew E is at position 5, so no new info.\n\nNow, combining:\nFrom guess 1: R is present, not at position 2 (guessed position).\nFrom guess 2: R is present, not at position 1 (guessed). So R cannot be at position 1 or 2. But secret positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> position 3 is A, not available. Position 5 is E, not available. So R must be at position 4? Or there are duplicates? For example, if secret has two R\'s? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nAlso, S is present but not at position 4.\n\nAlso, we know:\n- Absent letters: C, N, I\n\nNow, secret pattern: positions:\nPos1: unknown\nPos2: unknown\nPos3: A\nPos4: must contain R or S? Or R and S? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe know R is present and not in position 1 or 2. Position 3 is A, position 5 is E. So R must be at position 4? Because position 4 is the only one left? Unless there is another position? Positions available for R: only position 4? Or could there be duplicate letters? For example, if the secret has R at position 4, and also at position 1? But we got R(1):- meaning that position 1 is not R? So no duplicate R at position 1? And feedback for R doesn\'t reveal duplicates.\n\nBut since R(1) was marked present but wrong position, it implies there is at least one R elsewhere. Since positions 1 and 2 are not R per feedbacks, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so R must be at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S is present but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1 or 2.\n\nFrom guess 1, R was guessed at position 2 and marked -, and also R is at position 4 in secret? Yes.\n\nFrom guess 2, S is guessed at position 4 and marked -, so S is not at position 4. Since position 3 is A and position 5 is E, S must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, note that in guess 1, we didn\'t have S, so no conflict.\n\nSummary:\n- Secret: letter1: something (S or other)\n- letter2: something (or S)\n- letter3: A\n- letter4: R   (since it must be there; see above)\n- letter5: E\n\nAlso, present letters: R (at pos4), S (at pos1 or 2), A (pos3), E (pos5)\nAbsent: C, N, I\n\nFrom guess 2, A is present and was guessed at position 2 but is actually at position 3, so minus, makes sense.\n\nS is present but not at pos4, so in secret S must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits: _ ? A R E, where _ can be S or other? But we know S is present, so either at 1 or 2.\n\nBut not necessarily S is at 1 or 2; it could also be that secret has S at a position we haven\'t guessed, but in the secret positions, only pos1 and pos2 are available for S? Because pos3,4,5 are filled: A at 3, R at 4, E at 5.\n\nYes: secret: \n  pos1: ?\n  pos2: ?\n  pos3: A\n  pos4: R\n  pos5: E\n\nS is in the secret, but not at pos4 (where we guessed S). So S must be at pos1 or pos2? That\'s the only places.\n\nNow, at pos1: letter, which could be S? Or at pos2: which could be S? But not both? Or could be duplicate S? Possible, but let\'s see.\n\nSo secret pattern: [S?] [S?] A R E\n\nWe know S is one of the first two letters? Or could be at pos1 and/or pos2.\n\nWe also know that there might be one or two S.\n\nBut we should try to find a word that matches: _ _ A R E, with S in the first or second position, and the other position to be filled.\n\nBut what are the possibilities?\n\nCommon words ending with ""ARE"" but not at the end: the word is ?? ARE -> five letters, so first two letters followed by ""ARE"".\n\nWords: \n- STARE: S T A R E -> then pos1=S, pos2=T, pos3=A, pos4=R, pos5=E -> note S at position 1, T at 2.\n- SCARE: but C is absent -> no\n- SNARE: N is absent -> no\n- SHARE: H unknown -> possible\n- SPARE: P unknown -> possible\n- STARE: as above\n- SWARE: not common\n\nAlso: \n- GLARE: G L A R E -> pos1=G, pos2=L, then ARE -> does not have S? Unless S is at pos1? But if secret word is GLARE, it doesn\'t have S? But we know S is present.\n\nSo must have S and R and A and E.\n\nWords with pattern: \n- If S is at pos1: then the word looks like S? ARE → e.g., STARE, SHARE, SPARE, etc.\n- If S is at pos2: then the pattern is ? S ARE → e.g., US ARE -> but ""USARE"" is not a word, or ?SARE? -> 5 letter words: maybe ASHRE? no. Common words? \n\n""USHER"" not fit. Perhaps ""TSARE"": t s a r e? Tsare is a word? I think it\'s ""tsar"" but tsare? Not common.\n\nOther possibilities: ?SARE: CSARE? C is absent. NSARE? N absent. So not many.\n\nTherefore, it\'s more likely that S is at position 1: so words like STARE, SHARE, SPARE.\n\nBut we need to check with previous feedback.\n\nWe also need to avoid C and N and I.\n\nSo our next guess:\n\nWe can try to be systematic: we want to guess one of the possibilities: STARE, SHARE, SPARE, for example.\n\nBut we might also get feedback about other letters.\n\nLet\'s consider: if we guess ""STARE"":\n\n- S at pos1: secret has S at either pos1 or pos2. If secret has S at pos1, then S should be marked ✓? Otherwise, -?\n- How: If secret has S at pos1, then our S at pos1 should be ✓.\n- If secret has S at pos2, then our S at pos1 is present but not here? But in ""STARE"", S is at pos1, so if secret has S at pos2, then we get S(-) meaning it\'s present but not at pos1.\n\nSimilarly, T at pos2: unknown.\n\nBut in secret, position 2: could be S or other.\n\nWe also know that S is present in secret.\n\nBut to save guesses, we can guess ""STARE"":\n\n- If the feedback gives S as ✓, then S is at pos1 and we have pattern S T A R E? But T might be wrong.\n- Or if S is -, then S is at pos2.\n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, total 6 tries, we used 2.\n\nBut guessing ""STARE"" might resolve.\n\nHowever, if we guess ""STARE"" and it\'s not the word, we get more feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses new letters to test more.\n\nFor example, avoid repeating letters? But we have to include S? We can skip S? Or are there other constraints?\n\nAnother idea: include another common letter.\n\nBut to be efficient, let\'s list what we need to know: position 1 and position 2, one of which is S? Or both?\n\nBut since S is present, and not at pos4, and only pos1 and 2 available, then one of those is S? But there could be duplicates? For example, secret word ""SKATE"" doesn’t fit because K not S and T? But no: pattern must be ? ? A R E.\n\nLet\'s think of words:\n\nExamples::\n- ""SPARE"": S P A R E -> if secret is this, then S at pos1.\n- ""STARE"": S T A R E\n- ""SHARE"": S H A R E\n- ""SWARE"": S W A R E, but WARE at end, valid? Yes.\n- Also: ""SCORE"": C absent -> invalid\n- ""SNORE"": N absent -> invalid\n- ""GLARE"": G L A R E -> but does it have S? No.\n\n""PARSE"": P A R S E -> pattern is P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but we know secret pos3 is A? But that would be position 3? In ""PARSE"", pos3 is R -> but our secret must have A at pos3, and R at pos4. So ""PARSE"" doesn\'t fit because it has R at pos3? So only words with A at pos3 and R at pos4.\n\nSo possible 5-letter words: [letter1][letter2]A R E\n\nWith S one of letter1 or letter2.\n\nNow, letter1 and letter2: one is S? Or not necessarily. Actually, S must be at letter1 or letter2 because those are the only positions left.\n\nSo the first two letters include S and one other letter.\n\nCommon words: \nspare: S at1\nstare: S at1\nshare: S at1\nsnare: not possible (N)\nsward: not ARE pattern.\n\nIf S at pos2: \nThen words: ? S A R E -> for example, TSARE? Not common. \nOr DSARE? Not valid.\nUSARE? Not a word.\nSo no common words with S at position 2. \n\nTherefore, S must be at position 1.\n\nSo secret word is S _ A R E, with the second letter to be identified.\n\nCommon words: SPARE, STARE, SHARE, SWARE, etc.\n\nNow, we know that C, N, I are absent.\n\nSo:\nspare: P unknown\nstare: T unknown\nshare: H unknown\nsware: W unknown\nOthers: ""scare"" invalid (C), ""snare"" invalid (N).\n\nWe can guess ""STARE"": tests T.\n\nBut let\'s see the remaining letters.\n\nSince we have one of the words, we can guess one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can pick a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only unknown at position 2.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""STARE"" as it is a common word.\n\nThus, guess.\n\nBut if I guess ""STARE"", then:\n\n- If secret is ""SPARE"", then S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) -> T marked x?\n- If secret is ""STARE"", then all ✓.\n\nEither way, we get information.\n\nBut we have sufficient information if we get the feedback.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""STARE"".\n\nBut we need to choose a word that is valid. Assume all above are valid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STARE"".\n\nFeedback for STARE might tell us the second letter.\n\nBut in the context, let\'s do.\n\nAnother thought: in guess 2, we are told that S is present but not at pos4. Since we guess S at pos4, but it was not there. But now the secret must have S at pos1 (since common words support that).\n\nTherefore, our next guess: STARE.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (""crane""):**\n   - C (position 1): **x** → Absent, so eliminate C.\n   - R (position 2): **-** → R is in the word but not at position 2.\n   - A (position 3): **✓** → A is correct at position 3. Secret must have A at position 3.\n   - N (position 4): **x** → Absent, so eliminate N.\n   - E (position 5): **✓** → E is correct at position 5. Secret must have E at position 5.\n   \n   **Secret pattern so far:** `_ _ A _ E`  \n   **Known letters:** R is present (but not at position 2), A at position 3, E at position 5.  \n   **Absent letters:** C, N.\n\n2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (""raise""):**\n   - R (position 1): **-** → R is present but not at position 1.  \n     Combined with Guess 1 (R not at position 2), R must be at position 4 (since position 3 is A and position 5 is E).\n   - A (position 2): **-** → A is present but not at position 2. This is consistent, as A is fixed at position 3.\n   - I (position 3): **x** → Absent, so eliminate I.\n   - S (position 4): **-** → S is present but not at position 4. Since positions 3 and 5 are fixed, and position 4 is now revealed as R, S must be at position 1 or 2.\n   - E (position 5): **✓** → Confirms E at position 5.\n\n   **Updated secret pattern:** `_ _ A R E`  \n   **Known letters:**  \n     - Position 3: A  \n     - Position 4: R  \n     - Position 5: E  \n     - S is present at position 1 or 2.  \n   **Absent letters:** C, N, I.\n\n**Inference:**  \nThe secret word is `[letter1] [letter2] A R E`, where:  \n- `letter1` or `letter2` must be S (since S is present and only positions 1 and 2 are open).  \n- Common English words fitting this pattern include **STARE**, **SHARE**, **SPARE**, or **SWARE**.  \n- Given absent letters (C, N, I), **STARE** is a strong candidate: it tests S at position 1 and introduces T at position 2.  \n\n**Next guess:**  \nGuess **""stare""** to:  \n- Confirm S at position 1 (if ✓, S is correct; if -, S must be at position 2).  \n- Test T as a new letter.\n\n<guess>stare</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess ""stare"":
- S(✓) at position 1: correct, so secret has S at position 1.
- T(x) at position 2: T is absent from the secret word.
- A(✓) at position 3: correct (already known).
- R(✓) at position 4: correct (we deduced R at position 4 from previous feedback, now confirmed).
- E(✓) at position 5: correct (already known).

So now we know:
- Secret word: S _ A R E, with the second letter missing.
- T is absent (so we eliminate T).
- We already know C, N, I are absent.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: S ? A R E, where the second letter is not C, N, I, T (and also not S, A, R, E because they are already placed, but we don't know about duplicates? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, then a letter (not C, N, I, T), then A, R, E.

Common words:
- SHARE: H is not eliminated.
- SPARE: P is not eliminated.
- SWARE: W is not eliminated.
- SCARE: C is absent -> invalid.
- SNARE: N is absent -> invalid.
- STARE: we just guessed, and T is absent -> invalid.

So possible words: SHARE, SPARE, SWARE, etc.

We have to choose one. Since we have only one position to determine, we can try SHARE.

But note: we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

We can also consider that we might have duplicates? But no feedback suggested duplicates so far.

So let's list the possibilities and pick one that tests a common letter.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes other common letters to eliminate more, but we only have one unknown letter. So we can directly guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""SHARE"" because H is a common letter.

If it's not SHARE, then we can try SPARE next.

But we can also think: we have not tested H, P, W, etc.

But since we are down to one letter, we can guess.

So guess: SHARE.

But let's see the pattern: S H A R E.

If we guess SHARE, and the secret is SPARE, then we get:
- S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) -> H absent, so we know it's not H, then next guess SPARE.

Similarly, if secret is SHARE, we win.

So it's efficient.

Thus, I'll guess ""SHARE"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C (x), R (-), A (✓), N (x), E (✓)  
  → Revealed: A at position 3, E at position 5, R present (not at position 2), C/N absent.

- **Guess 2 (""raise"")**:  
  - R (-), A (-), I (x), S (-), E (✓)  
  → Revealed: R at position 4 (since not at 1 or 2, and positions 3/5 fixed), S present (not at position 4), I absent.

- **Guess 3 (""stare"")**:  
  - S (✓), T (x), A (✓), R (✓), E (✓)  
  → Revealed: S at position 1, T absent. Confirmed A/R/E positions (3/4/5).

**Current knowledge**:  
- **Secret pattern**: `S _ A R E` (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 4=R, 5=E).  
- **Missing**: Only position 2 is unknown.  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, I, T.  
- **Possible words**: Position 2 must be a letter not absent and not S/A/R/E (unless duplicates, but no evidence). Common options:  
  - **SHARE** (H at position 2)  
  - **SPARE** (P at position 2)  
  - **SWARE** (W at position 2)  

**Strategy for Guess 4**:  
- Test **""share""** to check H at position 2.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, H is absent, narrowing to SPARE/SWARE for subsequent guesses.  

<guess>share</guess>",share,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""stare"":
- S(✓) at position 1: correct, so secret has S at position 1.
- T(x) at position 2: T is absent from the secret word.
- A(✓) at position 3: correct (already known).
- R(✓) at position 4: correct (we deduced R at position 4 from previous feedback, now confirmed).
- E(✓) at position 5: correct (already known).
