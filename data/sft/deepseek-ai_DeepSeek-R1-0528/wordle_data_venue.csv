We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5: E)
- Contains N, but not in the 4th position (so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5. Since position 4 was wrong, N can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N cannot be there. So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Actually, the feedback for N is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 4th position. It could be in any other position except 4. But position 5 is taken by E, so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? However, note that the feedback doesn't say that the position is the only one, but we know E is at position 5, so N cannot be at 5. So yes, N is in one of the first three positions.

Also, we must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We also know that the word contains N and E (with E at the end).

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word ending with E (since E is fixed at the end) and that includes N (but not at the 4th position) and avoids C, R, A.

But note: the feedback for E was a check, so we know the last letter is E. So our next guess must have E at the end.

We also know that N is in the word but not at position 4. So in our next guess, we can try to put N in a different position (like 1, 2, or 3) to test.

But we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions, and without C, R, A.

Also, we want to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, etc.

We can try to form a word that has:
- Position 5: E
- Includes N (in position 1, 2, or 3)
- Does not include C, R, A.

Possible words:

Option: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E. But note: N is at position 4. But we know from feedback that N is not at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in ""crane"" (where N was at position 4) it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in our next guess, and if the secret word has N at position 4, we would get a check? But we know it's not at position 4. So we should avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? It would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So better to put N in a new position.

So in ""SPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

We want N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try:

- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> N at position 2? Actually: S (1), N (2), I (3), D (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. This is acceptable.

But we don't know if S, I, D are in the word.

Another option: ""INANE"": I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But the word has two N's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one N? Actually, the secret word might have two N's? We don't know. But we know A is not in the word, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

Another: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> N at position 2. This is good.

But we don't know about U, I, T.

Another: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> N at position 1. This is good.

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

We can also consider: ""TOUPE"" -> T, O, U, P, E. But this doesn't have N? We must include N? Actually, no: we are not forced to include N in the second guess? But we know the word has N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about where N is. Also, we can use the guess to test other letters.

But including N would help us find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid N for now and test other letters? But we know the word has N, so we should try to find its position.

So I think it's better to include N in the guess.

Let me list some words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3 and without C, R, A.

Possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N(1), O, I, S, E -> positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. This is good because we test N at position 1 and also test O, I, S.

- ""SNIPE"": S(1), N(2), I, P, E -> N at position 2. Tests S, N, I, P.

- ""UNITE"": U(1), N(2), I, T, E -> N at position 2. Tests U, N, I, T.

- ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""DANCE"": D, A, N, C, E -> has A and C, invalid.

- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it ends with D? No, ""LINED"" is L-I-N-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

So ""LINED"" is not valid for ending.

""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4. We want to avoid position 4 for N? Because we know it's not there in the secret word. So if we put N at position 4, we know it will be a '-' at best? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and the secret word has N at a different position, we will get a '-' again. But we already know it's not at 4, so we don't gain new information. So better to put N at a position we haven't tested (1,2,3).

So ""PHONE"" has N at 4, so not ideal.

Similarly, ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> N at 4, same issue.

So avoid position 4 for N.

Now, let's choose between ""NOISE"", ""SNIPE"", ""UNITE"", etc.

We also want to cover new letters that are common.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, P, etc.

In ""NOISE"": we test N, O, I, S, and E (which we know). So new letters: O, I, S.

In ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> new: S, I, P.

In ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> new: U, I, T.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and N at position 1.

But note: we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 1. So if we put N at position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, we can try ""UNITE"" to test N at position 2.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" because it tests multiple common letters.

So guess: ""NOISE""

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it at position 1? We don't know.
- Position 2: O -> new
- Position 3: I -> new
- Position 4: S -> new
- Position 5: E -> we know it's correct.

This will give us information about N's position and also about O, I, S.

So I think it's a good guess.

But note: we must make sure that ""NOISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

But wait: what if the secret word has two E's? We only know one E at the end. But it might have another E? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at the end) and one N (with a minus). But the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But ""NOISE"" has distinct letters, so that's fine.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in a different position to test.

But I think ""NOISE"" is fine.

Another option: ""TOISE"" is not a word.

Or ""SHINE"" but N at 4, which we avoid.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that has N at position 3? For example, ""POINT"" doesn't end with E. ""JOINT"" same. ""ANISE"" has A, which is invalid. ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E and has two N's? And not ending with E.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N at position 4. Again, position 4.

""ALINE"" has A, invalid.

So ""NOISE"" seems good.

Therefore, we guess ""NOISE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, R, and A are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- It must include N, but not in position 4 (so N should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new positions).
- It should avoid C, R, and A.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., S, O, I, T, U).

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places N in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Includes new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), and S (position 4).
- Avoids C, R, and A.

This guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of O, I, and S.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5: E)
- Contains N, but not in the 4th position (so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5. Since position 4 was wrong, N can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N cannot be there. So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Actually, the feedback for N is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 4th position. It could be in any other position except 4. But position 5 is taken by E, so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? However, note that the feedback doesn't say that the position is the only one, but we know E is at position 5, so N cannot be at 5. So yes, N is in one of the first three positions.

Also, we must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We also know that the word contains N and E (with E at the end).

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word ending with E (since E is fixed at the end) and that includes N (but not at the 4th position) and avoids C, R, A.

But note: the feedback for E was a check, so we know the last letter is E. So our next guess must have E at the end.

We also know that N is in the word but not at position 4. So in our next guess, we can try to put N in a different position (like 1, 2, or 3) to test.

But we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions, and without C, R, A.

Also, we want to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, etc.

We can try to form a word that has:
- Position 5: E
- Includes N (in position 1, 2, or 3)
- Does not include C, R, A.

Possible words:

Option: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E. But note: N is at position 4. But we know from feedback that N is not at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in ""crane"" (where N was at position 4) it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in our next guess, and if the secret word has N at position 4, we would get a check? But we know it's not at position 4. So we should avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? It would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So better to put N in a new position.

So in ""SPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

We want N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try:

- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> N at position 2? Actually: S (1), N (2), I (3), D (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. This is acceptable.

But we don't know if S, I, D are in the word.

Another option: ""INANE"": I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But the word has two N's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one N? Actually, the secret word might have two N's? We don't know. But we know A is not in the word, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

Another: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> N at position 2. This is good.

But we don't know about U, I, T.

Another: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> N at position 1. This is good.

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

We can also consider: ""TOUPE"" -> T, O, U, P, E. But this doesn't have N? We must include N? Actually, no: we are not forced to include N in the second guess? But we know the word has N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about where N is. Also, we can use the guess to test other letters.

But including N would help us find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid N for now and test other letters? But we know the word has N, so we should try to find its position.

So I think it's better to include N in the guess.

Let me list some words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3 and without C, R, A.

Possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N(1), O, I, S, E -> positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. This is good because we test N at position 1 and also test O, I, S.

- ""SNIPE"": S(1), N(2), I, P, E -> N at position 2. Tests S, N, I, P.

- ""UNITE"": U(1), N(2), I, T, E -> N at position 2. Tests U, N, I, T.

- ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""DANCE"": D, A, N, C, E -> has A and C, invalid.

- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it ends with D? No, ""LINED"" is L-I-N-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

So ""LINED"" is not valid for ending.

""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4. We want to avoid position 4 for N? Because we know it's not there in the secret word. So if we put N at position 4, we know it will be a '-' at best? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and the secret word has N at a different position, we will get a '-' again. But we already know it's not at 4, so we don't gain new information. So better to put N at a position we haven't tested (1,2,3).

So ""PHONE"" has N at 4, so not ideal.

Similarly, ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> N at 4, same issue.

So avoid position 4 for N.

Now, let's choose between ""NOISE"", ""SNIPE"", ""UNITE"", etc.

We also want to cover new letters that are common.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, P, etc.

In ""NOISE"": we test N, O, I, S, and E (which we know). So new letters: O, I, S.

In ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> new: S, I, P.

In ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> new: U, I, T.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and N at position 1.

But note: we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 1. So if we put N at position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, we can try ""UNITE"" to test N at position 2.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" because it tests multiple common letters.

So guess: ""NOISE""

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it at position 1? We don't know.
- Position 2: O -> new
- Position 3: I -> new
- Position 4: S -> new
- Position 5: E -> we know it's correct.

This will give us information about N's position and also about O, I, S.

So I think it's a good guess.

But note: we must make sure that ""NOISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

But wait: what if the secret word has two E's? We only know one E at the end. But it might have another E? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at the end) and one N (with a minus). But the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But ""NOISE"" has distinct letters, so that's fine.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in a different position to test.

But I think ""NOISE"" is fine.

Another option: ""TOISE"" is not a word.

Or ""SHINE"" but N at 4, which we avoid.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that has N at position 3? For example, ""POINT"" doesn't end with E. ""JOINT"" same. ""ANISE"" has A, which is invalid. ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E and has two N's? And not ending with E.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N at position 4. Again, position 4.

""ALINE"" has A, invalid.

So ""NOISE"" seems good.

Therefore, we guess ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, R, and A are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- It must include N, but not in position 4 (so N should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new positions).
- It should avoid C, R, and A.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., S, O, I, T, U).

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places N in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Includes new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), and S (position 4).
- Avoids C, R, and A.

This guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of O, I, and S.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)

- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

What we know so far:
- The word has E in position 5.
- The word contains N, but not in position 1 (from ""noise"") and not in position 4 (from ""crane""). So N must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 5 is E and taken).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains N in either position 2 or 3 (to test the remaining positions).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

Additionally, we should try to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, etc.

Since N must be in position 2 or 3, we can try both possibilities in different guesses, but we can only do one at a time.

Let's consider:

Option 1: Put N in position 2.
The word pattern: _ N _ _ E

Option 2: Put N in position 3.
The word pattern: _ _ N _ E

We need to fill the other positions with new letters (avoiding the excluded ones).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We can use: B, D, E (but E is at the end, and we don't know if there's another E), F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters.

Let's try to form words for each case.

First, if we put N in position 2: _ N _ _ E

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but I is excluded (from guess 2, I is not in the word). Invalid.
- ""UNITE"": same as above, has I and we know I is not in the word.
- ""UNDUE"": U, N, D, U, E -> has U at position 1 and 4? But we can use U. However, it has duplicate U? And position 3 is D, position 4 is U. But we don't know about U and D. But the word has duplicate U? Also, we need to check if valid. But note: we have to avoid I, which we are. But let's see: U is not excluded yet. However, the word ""undue"" is valid. But we have two U's? The feedback might be tricky if the word has only one U. But we don't know.

But we are trying to test N at position 2 and also test new letters.

Another word: ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but position 5 is E, so it would be U, N, M, E, T? That's not ending with E? ""UNMET"" is U-N-M-E-T, so position 4 is E and position 5 is T. But we need position 5 to be E. So invalid.

We need the last letter to be E, so position 5 is fixed.

So for _ N _ _ E, the fourth position must be a letter that can form a word ending with E.

Examples:
- ""ANKLE"": but A is excluded.
- ""ANGLE"": A excluded.
- ""UNCLE"": C excluded.
- ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
- ""UNDEE"": D, E, E? ""UNDEE"" is not a common word. Not valid.

Perhaps ""UNSEE"": but S is excluded and also not a word? ""unsee"" is a word, but S is excluded.

Another: ""INURE"": I excluded.

This is difficult. Let's try with N in position 3: _ _ N _ E

Pattern: position 1, 2, 3=N, 4, 5=E

Possible words:
- ""TUNED"": T, U, N, E, D -> but position 5 is D, not E. We need position 5 to be E, so this is invalid.
- ""TUNES"": T, U, N, E, S -> but S is excluded. Also, position 5 is S, not E? ""TUNES"" is T-U-N-E-S, so position 5 is S. We need position 5 to be E. So no.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E. Therefore, for pattern _ _ N _ E, the fourth letter must be such that the word ends with E, meaning the fourth letter and E form the end.

Examples of words ending with E: 
- ...NE: like ""LANE"" but that's 4 letters. 5 letters: ""PLANE"" but A excluded.

""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but O is excluded.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TRINE"": T, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.

""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> S and I excluded.

This is challenging. We need to avoid C, R, A, O, I, S.

Let me think of words ending with NE? But the pattern is _ _ N _ E, which is actually positions: 1,2,3=N,4,5=E. So the last two letters are ""NE""? No: position 3 is N and position 4 is some letter, position 5 is E. So the word ends with [letter]E, not necessarily NE.

For example, ""DANCE"" is D-A-N-C-E, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E. But A and C are excluded.

""MANGE"": M-A-N-G-E -> A excluded.

""MINCE"": M-I-N-C-E -> I and C excluded.

""LUNGE"": L-U-N-G-E -> this fits: positions 1:L, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. And L, U, G are not excluded.

Is ""lunge"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E -> but no N? We need N at position 3.

""LUNGE"" has N at position 3.

Another: ""BUNJE""? Not a word.

""RUNGE"": R excluded.

""PUNCE"": not common, and C might be excluded? C is excluded.

""TUNGE""? Not a word.

""GUNGE"": G-U-N-G-E -> duplicate G? And ""gunge"" might be a word, but let's see: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. We can test G and U.

But duplicate G might complicate feedback.

""LUNGE"" seems good: L, U, N, G, E.

We haven't used L, U, G.

So this tests:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, but we are testing position 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E (known)

If N is in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know N must be in position 2.

Also, we test L, U, G.

Another option: ""MUNGE"" similar to ""lunge"", but M instead of L.

But L is more common.

We could also consider ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.

Or ""FUNKY"" doesn't end with E.

So ""lunge"" is a candidate.

But what about N in position 2? We haven't found a good word for that.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have N in position 2 or 3 but still includes N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But if we don't include N, we might not find its position, but we can still test other letters. However, we have limited guesses, so it's better to include N to pin down the position.

Since we have two positions left for N (2 or 3), we can choose one to test.

In ""lunge"", we are testing position 3.

If we get a minus for N, then we know N must be in position 2.

If we get a check, then we know it's position 3.

So it's a good test.

Moreover, ""lunge"" uses new letters: L, U, G.

So I think it's a valid guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: _ _ N _ E -> with ""lunge"": L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Perfect.

And no excluded letters.

Therefore, we guess ""lunge"".

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

So the guess is ""lunge"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""noise"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 1. O, I, and S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 5**.
- **N must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, I, S (cannot be used).
- **Goal for the next guess**: 
  - Test N in position 3 (to narrow down its location—if N is not in position 3, it must be in position 2).
  - Include new common letters to gather more information (e.g., L, U, G).
  - Ensure the word ends with E (position 5).

The word ""lunge"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places N in position 3 (testing the remaining positions).
- Uses new common letters: L (position 1), U (position 2), and G (position 4).
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).

This guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of L, U, and G.

<guess>lunge</guess>",lunge,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

What we know so far:
- The word has E in position 5.
- The word contains N, but not in position 1 (from ""noise"") and not in position 4 (from ""crane""). So N must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 5 is E and taken).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains N in either position 2 or 3 (to test the remaining positions).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

Additionally, we should try to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, etc.

Since N must be in position 2 or 3, we can try both possibilities in different guesses, but we can only do one at a time.

Let's consider:

Option 1: Put N in position 2.
The word pattern: _ N _ _ E

Option 2: Put N in position 3.
The word pattern: _ _ N _ E

We need to fill the other positions with new letters (avoiding the excluded ones).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We can use: B, D, E (but E is at the end, and we don't know if there's another E), F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters.

Let's try to form words for each case.

First, if we put N in position 2: _ N _ _ E

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but I is excluded (from guess 2, I is not in the word). Invalid.
- ""UNITE"": same as above, has I and we know I is not in the word.
- ""UNDUE"": U, N, D, U, E -> has U at position 1 and 4? But we can use U. However, it has duplicate U? And position 3 is D, position 4 is U. But we don't know about U and D. But the word has duplicate U? Also, we need to check if valid. But note: we have to avoid I, which we are. But let's see: U is not excluded yet. However, the word ""undue"" is valid. But we have two U's? The feedback might be tricky if the word has only one U. But we don't know.

But we are trying to test N at position 2 and also test new letters.

Another word: ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but position 5 is E, so it would be U, N, M, E, T? That's not ending with E? ""UNMET"" is U-N-M-E-T, so position 4 is E and position 5 is T. But we need position 5 to be E. So invalid.

We need the last letter to be E, so position 5 is fixed.

So for _ N _ _ E, the fourth position must be a letter that can form a word ending with E.

Examples:
- ""ANKLE"": but A is excluded.
- ""ANGLE"": A excluded.
- ""UNCLE"": C excluded.
- ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
- ""UNDEE"": D, E, E? ""UNDEE"" is not a common word. Not valid.

Perhaps ""UNSEE"": but S is excluded and also not a word? ""unsee"" is a word, but S is excluded.

Another: ""INURE"": I excluded.

This is difficult. Let's try with N in position 3: _ _ N _ E

Pattern: position 1, 2, 3=N, 4, 5=E

Possible words:
- ""TUNED"": T, U, N, E, D -> but position 5 is D, not E. We need position 5 to be E, so this is invalid.
- ""TUNES"": T, U, N, E, S -> but S is excluded. Also, position 5 is S, not E? ""TUNES"" is T-U-N-E-S, so position 5 is S. We need position 5 to be E. So no.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E. Therefore, for pattern _ _ N _ E, the fourth letter must be such that the word ends with E, meaning the fourth letter and E form the end.

Examples of words ending with E: 
- ...NE: like ""LANE"" but that's 4 letters. 5 letters: ""PLANE"" but A excluded.

""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but O is excluded.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TRINE"": T, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.

""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> S and I excluded.

This is challenging. We need to avoid C, R, A, O, I, S.

Let me think of words ending with NE? But the pattern is _ _ N _ E, which is actually positions: 1,2,3=N,4,5=E. So the last two letters are ""NE""? No: position 3 is N and position 4 is some letter, position 5 is E. So the word ends with [letter]E, not necessarily NE.

For example, ""DANCE"" is D-A-N-C-E, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E. But A and C are excluded.

""MANGE"": M-A-N-G-E -> A excluded.

""MINCE"": M-I-N-C-E -> I and C excluded.

""LUNGE"": L-U-N-G-E -> this fits: positions 1:L, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. And L, U, G are not excluded.

Is ""lunge"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E -> but no N? We need N at position 3.

""LUNGE"" has N at position 3.

Another: ""BUNJE""? Not a word.

""RUNGE"": R excluded.

""PUNCE"": not common, and C might be excluded? C is excluded.

""TUNGE""? Not a word.

""GUNGE"": G-U-N-G-E -> duplicate G? And ""gunge"" might be a word, but let's see: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. We can test G and U.

But duplicate G might complicate feedback.

""LUNGE"" seems good: L, U, N, G, E.

We haven't used L, U, G.

So this tests:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, but we are testing position 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E (known)

If N is in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know N must be in position 2.

Also, we test L, U, G.

Another option: ""MUNGE"" similar to ""lunge"", but M instead of L.

But L is more common.

We could also consider ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.

Or ""FUNKY"" doesn't end with E.

So ""lunge"" is a candidate.

In ""lunge"", we are testing position 3.

If we get a minus for N, then we know N must be in position 2.

If we get a check, then we know it's position 3.

So it's a good test.

Moreover, ""lunge"" uses new letters: L, U, G.

So I think it's a valid guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: _ _ N _ E -> with ""lunge"": L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Perfect.

And no excluded letters.

Therefore, we guess ""lunge"".

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

So the guess is ""lunge"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, and A are absent.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was in the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong spot).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5: E)
- Contains N, but not in the 4th position (so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, positions 1, 2, or 3? But note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1,2,3,4,5. Since position 4 was wrong, N can be in 1,2,3, or 5? But position 5 is E, so N cannot be there. So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Actually, the feedback for N is '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 4th position. It could be in any other position except 4. But position 5 is taken by E, so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? However, note that the feedback doesn't say that the position is the only one, but we know E is at position 5, so N cannot be at 5. So yes, N is in one of the first three positions.

Also, we must avoid using C, R, A in our next guess.

We also know that the word contains N and E (with E at the end).

Now, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word ending with E (since E is fixed at the end) and that includes N (but not at the 4th position) and avoids C, R, A.

But note: the feedback for E was a check, so we know the last letter is E. So our next guess must have E at the end.

We also know that N is in the word but not at position 4. So in our next guess, we can try to put N in a different position (like 1, 2, or 3) to test.

But we have to avoid C, R, A.

Let's think of words that end with E and have an N in one of the first three positions, and without C, R, A.

Also, we want to cover more common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, etc.

We can try to form a word that has:
- Position 5: E
- Includes N (in position 1, 2, or 3)
- Does not include C, R, A.

Possible words:

Option: ""SPINE"" -> S, P, I, N, E. But note: N is at position 4. But we know from feedback that N is not at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in ""crane"" (where N was at position 4) it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in our next guess, and if the secret word has N at position 4, we would get a check? But we know it's not at position 4. So we should avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test other positions.

But note: we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? It would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So better to put N in a new position.

So in ""SPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

We want N in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try:

- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> N at position 2? Actually: S (1), N (2), I (3), D (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. This is acceptable.

But we don't know if S, I, D are in the word.

Another option: ""INANE"": I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N's? But the word has two N's? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one N? Actually, the secret word might have two N's? We don't know. But we know A is not in the word, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.

Another: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> N at position 2. This is good.

But we don't know about U, I, T.

Another: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> N at position 1. This is good.

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

We can also consider: ""TOUPE"" -> T, O, U, P, E. But this doesn't have N? We must include N? Actually, no: we are not forced to include N in the second guess? But we know the word has N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about where N is. Also, we can use the guess to test other letters.

But including N would help us find its position.

Alternatively, we can avoid N for now and test other letters? But we know the word has N, so we should try to find its position.

So I think it's better to include N in the guess.

Let me list some words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3 and without C, R, A.

Possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N(1), O, I, S, E -> positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. This is good because we test N at position 1 and also test O, I, S.

- ""SNIPE"": S(1), N(2), I, P, E -> N at position 2. Tests S, N, I, P.

- ""UNITE"": U(1), N(2), I, T, E -> N at position 2. Tests U, N, I, T.

- ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""DANCE"": D, A, N, C, E -> has A and C, invalid.

- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but doesn't end with E? Wait, it ends with D? No, ""LINED"" is L-I-N-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. We need the last letter to be E.

We need the word to end with E.

So ""LINED"" is not valid for ending.

""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Another: ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4. We want to avoid position 4 for N? Because we know it's not there in the secret word. So if we put N at position 4, we know it will be a '-' at best? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and the secret word has N at a different position, we will get a '-' again. But we already know it's not at 4, so we don't gain new information. So better to put N at a position we haven't tested (1,2,3).

So ""PHONE"" has N at 4, so not ideal.

Similarly, ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> N at 4, same issue.

So avoid position 4 for N.

Now, let's choose between ""NOISE"", ""SNIPE"", ""UNITE"", etc.

We also want to cover new letters that are common.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, P, etc.

In ""NOISE"": we test N, O, I, S, and E (which we know). So new letters: O, I, S.

In ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> new: S, I, P.

In ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> new: U, I, T.

I think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and N at position 1.

But note: we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4, but we don't know about position 1. So if we put N at position 1, we might get a check or a minus.

Similarly, we can try ""UNITE"" to test N at position 2.

But let's choose one.

I'll go with ""NOISE"" because it tests multiple common letters.

So guess: ""NOISE""

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it at position 1? We don't know.
- Position 2: O -> new
- Position 3: I -> new
- Position 4: S -> new
- Position 5: E -> we know it's correct.

This will give us information about N's position and also about O, I, S.

So I think it's a good guess.

But note: we must make sure that ""NOISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

So my second guess is ""NOISE"".

But wait: what if the secret word has two E's? We only know one E at the end. But it might have another E? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at the end) and one N (with a minus). But the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But ""NOISE"" has distinct letters, so that's fine.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has N in a different position to test.

But I think ""NOISE"" is fine.

Another option: ""TOISE"" is not a word.

Or ""SHINE"" but N at 4, which we avoid.

So I'll go with ""NOISE"".

But let me see if there's a word that has N at position 3? For example, ""POINT"" doesn't end with E. ""JOINT"" same. ""ANISE"" has A, which is invalid. ""ENNUI"" doesn't end with E and has two N's? And not ending with E.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N at position 4. Again, position 4.

""ALINE"" has A, invalid.

So ""NOISE"" seems good.

Therefore, we guess ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- C, R, and A are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- It must include N, but not in position 4 (so N should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new positions).
- It should avoid C, R, and A.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., S, O, I, T, U).

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places N in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Includes new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), and S (position 4).
- Avoids C, R, and A.

This guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of O, I, and S.

- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

What we know so far:
- The word has E in position 5.
- The word contains N, but not in position 1 (from ""noise"") and not in position 4 (from ""crane""). So N must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 5 is E and taken).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains N in either position 2 or 3 (to test the remaining positions).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

Additionally, we should try to include new common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried: T, L, U, D, P, M, G, B, etc.

Since N must be in position 2 or 3, we can try both possibilities in different guesses, but we can only do one at a time.

Let's consider:

Option 1: Put N in position 2.
The word pattern: _ N _ _ E

Option 2: Put N in position 3.
The word pattern: _ _ N _ E

We need to fill the other positions with new letters (avoiding the excluded ones).

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I, S.

We can use: B, D, E (but E is at the end, and we don't know if there's another E), F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters.

Let's try to form words for each case.

First, if we put N in position 2: _ N _ _ E

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but I is excluded (from guess 2, I is not in the word). Invalid.
- ""UNITE"": same as above, has I and we know I is not in the word.
- ""UNDUE"": U, N, D, U, E -> has U at position 1 and 4? But we can use U. However, it has duplicate U? And position 3 is D, position 4 is U. But we don't know about U and D. But the word has duplicate U? Also, we need to check if valid. But note: we have to avoid I, which we are. But let's see: U is not excluded yet. However, the word ""undue"" is valid. But we have two U's? The feedback might be tricky if the word has only one U. But we don't know.

But we are trying to test N at position 2 and also test new letters.

Another word: ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but position 5 is E, so it would be U, N, M, E, T? That's not ending with E? ""UNMET"" is U-N-M-E-T, so position 4 is E and position 5 is T. But we need position 5 to be E. So invalid.

We need the last letter to be E, so position 5 is fixed.

So for _ N _ _ E, the fourth position must be a letter that can form a word ending with E.

Examples:
- ""ANKLE"": but A is excluded.
- ""ANGLE"": A excluded.
- ""UNCLE"": C excluded.
- ""UNTIE"": I excluded.
- ""UNDEE"": D, E, E? ""UNDEE"" is not a common word. Not valid.

Perhaps ""UNSEE"": but S is excluded and also not a word? ""unsee"" is a word, but S is excluded.

Another: ""INURE"": I excluded.

This is difficult. Let's try with N in position 3: _ _ N _ E

Pattern: position 1, 2, 3=N, 4, 5=E

Possible words:
- ""TUNED"": T, U, N, E, D -> but position 5 is D, not E. We need position 5 to be E, so this is invalid.
- ""TUNES"": T, U, N, E, S -> but S is excluded. Also, position 5 is S, not E? ""TUNES"" is T-U-N-E-S, so position 5 is S. We need position 5 to be E. So no.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter must be E. Therefore, for pattern _ _ N _ E, the fourth letter must be such that the word ends with E, meaning the fourth letter and E form the end.

Examples of words ending with E: 
- ...NE: like ""LANE"" but that's 4 letters. 5 letters: ""PLANE"" but A excluded.

""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> but O is excluded.

""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TRINE"": T, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.

""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""TWINE"": T, W, I, N, E -> I excluded.

""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> S and I excluded.

This is challenging. We need to avoid C, R, A, O, I, S.

Let me think of words ending with NE? But the pattern is _ _ N _ E, which is actually positions: 1,2,3=N,4,5=E. So the last two letters are ""NE""? No: position 3 is N and position 4 is some letter, position 5 is E. So the word ends with [letter]E, not necessarily NE.

For example, ""DANCE"" is D-A-N-C-E, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E. But A and C are excluded.

""MANGE"": M-A-N-G-E -> A excluded.

""MINCE"": M-I-N-C-E -> I and C excluded.

""LUNGE"": L-U-N-G-E -> this fits: positions 1:L, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. And L, U, G are not excluded.

Is ""lunge"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E -> but no N? We need N at position 3.

""LUNGE"" has N at position 3.

Another: ""BUNJE""? Not a word.

""RUNGE"": R excluded.

""PUNCE"": not common, and C might be excluded? C is excluded.

""TUNGE""? Not a word.

""GUNGE"": G-U-N-G-E -> duplicate G? And ""gunge"" might be a word, but let's see: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. We can test G and U.

But duplicate G might complicate feedback.

""LUNGE"" seems good: L, U, N, G, E.

We haven't used L, U, G.

So this tests:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, but we are testing position 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E (known)

If N is in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know N must be in position 2.

Also, we test L, U, G.

Another option: ""MUNGE"" similar to ""lunge"", but M instead of L.

But L is more common.

We could also consider ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.

Or ""FUNKY"" doesn't end with E.

So ""lunge"" is a candidate.

But what about N in position 2? We haven't found a good word for that.

Perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have N in position 2 or 3 but still includes N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.

But if we don't include N, we might not find its position, but we can still test other letters. However, we have limited guesses, so it's better to include N to pin down the position.

Since we have two positions left for N (2 or 3), we can choose one to test.

In ""lunge"", we are testing position 3.

If we get a minus for N, then we know N must be in position 2.

If we get a check, then we know it's position 3.

So it's a good test.

Moreover, ""lunge"" uses new letters: L, U, G.

So I think it's a valid guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: _ _ N _ E -> with ""lunge"": L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Perfect.

And no excluded letters.

Therefore, we guess ""lunge"".

But note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.

So the guess is ""lunge"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, and A are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""noise"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 1. O, I, and S are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 5**.
- **N must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 3.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, I, S (cannot be used).
- **Goal for the next guess**: 
  - Test N in position 3 (to narrow down its location—if N is not in position 3, it must be in position 2).
  - Include new common letters to gather more information (e.g., L, U, G).
  - Ensure the word ends with E (position 5).

The word ""lunge"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places N in position 3 (testing the remaining positions).
- Uses new common letters: L (position 1), U (position 2), and G (position 4).
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).

This guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of L, U, and G.

So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? Actually, the feedback for N is \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 4th position. It could be in any other position except 4. But position 5 is taken by E, so N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? However, note that the feedback doesn\'t say that the position is the only one, but we know E is at position 5, so N cannot be at 5.

But note: N is at position 4. But we know from feedback that N is not at position 4 in the secret word? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in ""crane"" (where N was at position 4) it was wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So if we put N at position 4 in our next guess, and if the secret word has N at position 4, we would get a check? But we know it\'s not at position 4. So we should avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess? Actually, we can put it elsewhere to test other positions.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to put N at position 4 again? It would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not there. So better to put N in a new position.\n\nSo in ""SPINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.\n\nWe want N in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- ""SNIDE"": S, N, I, D, E -> N at position 2? Actually: S (1), N (2), I (3), D (4), E (5). So N is at position 2. This is acceptable.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, I, D are in the word.\n\nAnother option: ""INANE"": I, N, A, N, E -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and also has two N\'s? But the word has two N\'s? The feedback for ""crane"" had only one N? Actually, the secret word might have two N\'s? We don\'t know. But we know A is not in the word, so ""INANE"" is invalid because of A.\n\nAnother: ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> N at position 2. This is good.\n\nBut we don\'t know about U, I, T.\n\nAnother: ""NOISE"": N, O, I, S, E -> N at position 1. This is good.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.\n\nWe can also consider: ""TOUPE"" -> T, O, U, P, E. But this doesn\'t have N? We must include N? Actually, no: we are not forced to include N in the second guess? But we know the word has N, so if we don\'t include N, we might not get information about where N is. Also, we can use the guess to test other letters.\n\nBut including N would help us find its position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid N for now and test other letters? But we know the word has N, so we should try to find its position.\n\nSo I think it\'s better to include N in the guess.\n\nLet me list some words ending with E that have N in position 1, 2, or 3 and without C, R, A.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""NOISE"": N(1), O, I, S, E -> positions: 1:N, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E. This is good because we test N at position 1 and also test O, I, S.\n\n- ""SNIPE"": S(1), N(2), I, P, E -> N at position 2. Tests S, N, I, P.\n\n- ""UNITE"": U(1), N(2), I, T, E -> N at position 2. Tests U, N, I, T.\n\n- ""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n- ""DANCE"": D, A, N, C, E -> has A and C, invalid.\n\n- ""LINED"": L, I, N, E, D -> but doesn\'t end with E? Wait, it ends with D? No, ""LINED"" is L-I-N-E-D, so the last letter is D, not E. We need the last letter to be E.\n\nWe need the word to end with E.\n\nSo ""LINED"" is not valid for ending.\n\n""LINE"" is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nAnother: ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> N at position 4. We want to avoid position 4 for N? Because we know it\'s not there in the secret word. So if we put N at position 4, we know it will be a \'-\' at best? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and the secret word has N at a different position, we will get a \'-\' again. But we already know it\'s not at 4, so we don\'t gain new information. So better to put N at a position we haven\'t tested (1,2,3).\n\nSo ""PHONE"" has N at 4, so not ideal.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> N at 4, same issue.\n\nSo avoid position 4 for N.\n\nNow, let\'s choose between ""NOISE"", ""SNIPE"", ""UNITE"", etc.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters that are common.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, P, etc.\n\nIn ""NOISE"": we test N, O, I, S, and E (which we know). So new letters: O, I, S.\n\nIn ""SNIPE"": S, N, I, P, E -> new: S, I, P.\n\nIn ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> new: U, I, T.\n\nI think ""NOISE"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and N at position 1.\n\nBut note: we know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4, but we don\'t know about position 1. So if we put N at position 1, we might get a check or a minus.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""UNITE"" to test N at position 2.\n\nBut let\'s choose one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""NOISE"" because it tests multiple common letters.\n\nSo guess: ""NOISE""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- Position 1: N -> we know N is in the word, but is it at position 1? We don\'t know.\n- Position 2: O -> new\n- Position 3: I -> new\n- Position 4: S -> new\n- Position 5: E -> we know it\'s correct.\n\nThis will give us information about N\'s position and also about O, I, S.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nBut note: we must make sure that ""NOISE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\nSo my second guess is ""NOISE"".\n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has two E\'s? We only know one E at the end. But it might have another E? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at the end) and one N (with a minus). But the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut ""NOISE"" has distinct letters, so that\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has N in a different position to test.\n\nBut I think ""NOISE"" is fine.\n\nAnother option: ""TOISE"" is not a word.\n\nOr ""SHINE"" but N at 4, which we avoid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""NOISE"".\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that has N at position 3? For example, ""POINT"" doesn\'t end with E. ""JOINT"" same. ""ANISE"" has A, which is invalid. ""ENNUI"" doesn\'t end with E and has two N\'s? And not ending with E.\n\n""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N at position 4. Again, position 4.\n\n""ALINE"" has A, invalid.\n\nSo ""NOISE"" seems good.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""NOISE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the correct position (position 5).\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- C, R, and A are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (position 5).\n- It must include N, but not in position 4 (so N should be placed in position 1, 2, or 3 to test new positions).\n- It should avoid C, R, and A.\n- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., S, O, I, T, U).\n\nThe word ""noise"" fits these criteria:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Places N in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Includes new common letters: O (position 2), I (position 3), and S (position 4).\n- Avoids C, R, and A.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of O, I, and S.\n\n<guess>noise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""noise""\n- N: - (in the word, but not in position 1)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The word has E in position 5.\n- The word contains N, but not in position 1 (from ""noise"") and not in position 4 (from ""crane"").

We need to avoid C, R, A, O, I, S.\n\nLet me think of words ending with NE? But the pattern is _ _ N _ E, which is actually positions: 1,2,3=N,4,5=E. So the last two letters are ""NE""? No: position 3 is N and position 4 is some letter, position 5 is E. So the word ends with [letter]E, not necessarily NE.\n\nFor example, ""DANCE"" is D-A-N-C-E, so positions: 1:D, 2:A, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E. But A and C are excluded.\n\n""MANGE"": M-A-N-G-E -> A excluded.\n\n""MINCE"": M-I-N-C-E -> I and C excluded.\n\n""LUNGE"": L-U-N-G-E -> this fits: positions 1:L, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. And L, U, G are not excluded.\n\nIs ""lunge"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLUME"": P-L-U-M-E -> but no N? We need N at position 3.\n\n""LUNGE"" has N at position 3.\n\nAnother: ""BUNJE""? Not a word.\n\n""RUNGE"": R excluded.\n\n""PUNCE"": not common, and C might be excluded? C is excluded.\n\n""TUNGE""? Not a word.\n\n""GUNGE"": G-U-N-G-E -> duplicate G? And ""gunge"" might be a word, but let\'s see: positions 1:G, 2:U, 3:N, 4:G, 5:E. We can test G and U.\n\nBut duplicate G might complicate feedback.\n\n""LUNGE"" seems good: L, U, N, G, E.\n\nWe haven\'t used L, U, G.\n\nSo this tests:\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: N (we know N is in the word, but we are testing position 3)\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: E (known)\n\nIf N is in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know N must be in position 2.\n\nAlso, we test L, U, G.\n\nAnother option: ""MUNGE"" similar to ""lunge"", but M instead of L.\n\nBut L is more common.\n\nWe could also consider ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.\n\nOr ""FUNKY"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\nSo ""lunge"" is a candidate.\n\nBut what about N in position 2? We haven\'t found a good word for that.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that doesn\'t have N in position 2 or 3 but still includes N? But we know N is in the word, so we should include it to get position information.\n\nBut if we don\'t include N, we might not find its position, but we can still test other letters. However, we have limited guesses, so it\'s better to include N to pin down the position.\n\nSince we have two positions left for N (2 or 3), we can choose one to test.\n\nIn ""lunge"", we are testing position 3.\n\nIf we get a minus for N, then we know N must be in position 2.\n\nIf we get a check, then we know it\'s position 3.\n\nSo it\'s a good test.\n\nMoreover, ""lunge"" uses new letters: L, U, G.\n\nSo I think it\'s a valid guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: _ _ N _ E -> with ""lunge"": L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Perfect.\n\nAnd no excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""lunge"".\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, which is fixed.\n\nSo the guess is ""lunge"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, and A are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""noise"")**: E is correct and in position 5. N is in the word but not in position 1. O, I, and S are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E is fixed at position 5**.\n- **N must be in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 (from ""noise"") or 4 (from ""crane""). Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 3.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, O, I, S (cannot be used).\n- **Goal for the next guess**: \n  - Test N in position 3 (to narrow down its location—if N is not in position 3, it must be in position 2).\n  - Include new common letters to gather more information (e.g., L, U, G).\n  - Ensure the word ends with E (position 5).\n\nThe word ""lunge"" fits these criteria:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Places N in position 3 (testing the remaining positions).\n- Uses new common letters: L (position 1), U (position 2), and G (position 4).\n- Avoids all excluded letters (C, R, A, O, I, S).\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of N and test for the presence of L, U, and G.\n\n<guess>lunge</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: lunge -> FEEDBACK: L(x) U(-) N(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- N: - (present, wrong position; not position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is E)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (present, wrong position; not position 1)
- O: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- S: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

Guess 3: ""lunge""
- L: x (absent)
- U: - (present, wrong position; so U is in the word but not position 2)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is N)
- G: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So now we know:
- Position 3 is N.
- Position 5 is E.
- U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""lunge"").
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

Also, from the first guess, we know N was not in position 4 (which we now know is position 3, so that's consistent). From the second guess, N was not in position 1, which is also consistent since it's in position 3.

Now, the word so far: _ _ N _ E

We know U is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 3 and 5 are taken, U must be in position 1 or 4.

We have used 3 guesses and have 3 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Includes U, but not in position 2 (so in position 1 or 4).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

We should also test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The remaining positions are 1, 2, and 4.

We know U is in one of 1 or 4, so we can try to place U in one of these to test.

Also, position 2 is still unknown.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, D, P, M, B, Y, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Let's consider the two cases for U:

Case 1: U in position 1 -> U _ N _ E
Case 2: U in position 4 -> _ _ N U E

We can choose a word that tests one of these cases.

First, let's try to find words for Case 1: U in position 1.

Pattern: U ? N ? E

We need to fill position 2 and 4 with letters not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G

Available: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but I is excluded (from guess 2). Invalid.
- ""UNSEE"": U, N, S, E, E -> S excluded and duplicate E? Also not a valid word? ""unsee"" might be a word, but S is excluded.
- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but position 5 is T, not E. We need position 5 to be E. So invalid.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> I excluded.
- ""UNDUE"": U, N, D, U, E -> duplicate U? And position 5 is E? ""UNDUE"" is U-N-D-U-E, so positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:D, 4:U, 5:E. But position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be N. In this word, position 3 is D, not N. We cannot change position 3 because it's fixed as N.

We must keep position 3 as N and position 5 as E.

So for U in position 1: U _ N _ E

So position 2 and 4 to fill.

Examples:
- ""UPTIE"": U, P, T, I, E -> I excluded.
- ""UMPTE""? Not a word.
- ""UMBLE"": U, M, B, L, E -> L excluded.
- ""UNBED"": U, N, B, E, D -> position 3 is B? No, pattern: position 1:U, 2:N? But we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 cannot be N. In this pattern, position 2 is the second letter, and position 3 is N. So for ""U _ N _ E"", the second letter is position 2, and then position 3 is N.

So for example, ""UPNEE""? Not a word.

""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> R and A excluded, and doesn't end with E.

This is tough. Let's try Case 2: U in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N U E

So positions: 1, 2, 3=N, 4=U, 5=E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G

Available: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- ""TUNUE""? Not a word.
- ""TENUE"": T, E, N, U, E -> position 2 is E? But we have E at position 5, and also position 2 is E? But the word has two E's? ""TENUE"" is T-E-N-U-E, so positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E. This is valid. But we know E is at position 5, but is there another E? Possibly. We haven't ruled out multiple E's. Also, we are testing position 2 as E, which might be correct or not.

But in this word, we have E at position 2 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 2 might be E or not.

But we are allowed to have duplicate letters.

Also, we are testing T and the possibility of E at position 2.

But we also have U at position 4.

Another word: ""MENU"": not 5 letters.

""DENUE""? Not common.

""PENUE""? Not a word.

""VENUE"": V, E, N, U, E -> same as ""tenue"" but with V. ""Venue"" is a word: V-E-N-U-E.

Similarly, ""venue"" has positions: 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E.

We can use this.

Another: ""MENUE""? Not standard, but ""menue"" might be archaic. ""Venue"" is better.

""BENCH"": doesn't end with E and has C.

So ""venue"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to check if E at position 2 is possible. We don't know yet.

Another word: ""TUNED"": T, U, N, E, D -> but position 4 is E and position 5 is D? Not E at end. Invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> no N, and not the pattern.

So back to ""venue"": V, E, N, U, E.

This fits the pattern: position 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E.

We are testing:
- V at position 1
- E at position 2 (which might be present or not, but we know E is at 5, so if E is also at 2, we'll get feedback)
- U at position 4 (we know U is present, so we are testing its position)

But we already know U is present, and we are putting it at position 4. If U is at position 4 in the secret word, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know it must be at position 1.

Also, we test V.

But we are using E at position 2, which might be risky because if the word doesn't have E at position 2, we might get a minus, but we don't know if there is another E.

We have to consider that the secret word might have only one E (at position 5) or more.

In the first guess, we had E at position 5 correct, and no other E was indicated. But in ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and no other E, so if there was another E, it might have been shown? Not necessarily, because in ""crane"", the other positions didn't have E, so it wouldn't show. But we don't know if there is an E elsewhere.

Similarly, in ""noise"" and ""lunge"", we had E only at position 5.

So it's possible that there is only one E.

But in ""venue"", we are putting E at position 2, which might not be in the word.

But that's okay because we are testing.

Another word: ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.

""FUNKY"" no.

Perhaps ""PUNCE"" not word.

Another possibility: ""HUNKE""? Not word.

""MINUET"" is 6 letters.

Perhaps we can try a word without assuming U at position 4.

But we need to test U's position.

Another word for pattern _ _ N U E: ""THNUE""? Not word.

""WHNUE""? No.

So ""venue"" seems acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with U in position 1.

Earlier I struggled, but let's try again.

Pattern: U ? N ? E

Position 2: must be a letter, position 4: must be a letter.

Words: ""UPTIE"" has I.

""UMBRE"" not word.

""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> but position 3 is B, not N. We need position 3 to be N.

So ""U?N?E"" — what words have this?

""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> position 3 is W, not N? Pattern: 1:U, 2:N, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 cannot be N. In this, position 2 is N, but we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 is different.

For ""U _ N _ E"", the second letter (position 2) is some letter, and position 3 is N.

So for example, ""UZBEK"" not ending with E.

""UDDER"" not.

""ULNAE"": U, L, N, A, E -> L and A excluded.

""URAEI""? Not word.

This is difficult. Maybe there are no common words with U at position 1, N at position 3, E at position 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

So perhaps Case 2 is better.

Another word for Case 2: _ _ N U E

""VENUE"" is one.

""DENIM"" not ending with E.

""PENNA"" not.

""JUNTA"" not.

""KNULE""? Not.

So ""venue"" seems the best option.

But in ""venue"", we have E at position 2. If the secret word does not have E at position 2, we will get a minus for that position, but we can still get information.

We also test V and the position of U.

Moreover, we know U is present, so if we put it at position 4 and it's correct, we get a check; if not, we know it must be at position 1.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""venue"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""venue"", then we get all correct.

But it might not be.

For example, if U is not at position 4, we get U as minus, and then we know U is at position 1.

Also, we learn about V and E at position 2.

So it's informative.

Another word: ""TENUE"" as I thought earlier, which is similar but with T.

""Tenue"" is a word, meaning bearing or posture, but less common than ""venue"". But both are valid.

I think ""venue"" is fine.

So we'll go with ""venue"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
     - C, R, A are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (""noise"")**:
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
     - O, I, S are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (""lunge"")**:
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (✓).
     - U is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
     - L and G are absent (x).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 3 is N (from ""lunge"" ✓).
     - Position 5 is E (consistent across all guesses).
   - **Confirmed Present Letters**:
     - N (position 3) and E (position 5) are confirmed.
     - U is in the word but not in position 2 (must be in position 1 or 4).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (cannot be used).
   - **Remaining Positions**: 1, 2, and 4 need to be solved.
   - **Constraints for Next Guess**:
     - Must end with E (position 5).
     - Must include N at position 3.
     - Must include U (in position 1 or 4).
     - Avoid absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.
     - Test new common letters to gather information (e.g., T, D, V, M, P).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Test U's Position**: U must be in position 1 or 4. We can prioritize testing U in position 4 to potentially confirm its location, as position 1 can be tested later if needed.
   - **Cover New Letters**: Use untried common letters like V, E (for position 2), T, or D to maximize information. Since E is already confirmed at position 5, testing E in position 2 could reveal if there is a second E.
   - **Word Selection**: After evaluating possible words, ""venue"" fits:
     - Pattern: _ _ N U E (positions: 1, 2, 3=N, 4=U, 5=E).
     - Tests U in position 4 (if U is not here, it must be in position 1).
     - Tests V (new letter) in position 1.
     - Tests E in position 2 (to check for a second E).
     - Avoids all absent letters.

4. **Why ""venue""?**:
   - If U is in position 4, we get a ✓ for U and narrow down the word structure.
   - If U is not in position 4 (but we know it must be in position 1), we get a (-) for U and can adjust in the next guess.
   - Feedback on V and the position 2 letter (E) will help identify the remaining letters.
   - This guess efficiently uses the constraints and tests high-likelihood scenarios.

<guess>venue</guess>",venue,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- N: - (present, wrong position; not position 4)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is E)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (present, wrong position; not position 1)
- O: x (absent)
- I: x (absent)
- S: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

Guess 3: ""lunge""
- L: x (absent)
- U: - (present, wrong position; so U is in the word but not position 2)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is N)
- G: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So now we know:
- Position 3 is N.
- Position 5 is E.
- U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""lunge"").
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

Also, from the first guess, we know N was not in position 4 (which we now know is position 3, so that's consistent). From the second guess, N was not in position 1, which is also consistent since it's in position 3.

Now, the word so far: _ _ N _ E

We know U is in the word but not in position 2. Since positions 3 and 5 are taken, U must be in position 1 or 4.

We have used 3 guesses and have 3 left.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has N in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Includes U, but not in position 2 (so in position 1 or 4).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.

We should also test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The remaining positions are 1, 2, and 4.

We know U is in one of 1 or 4, so we can try to place U in one of these to test.

Also, position 2 is still unknown.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, D, P, M, B, Y, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Let's consider the two cases for U:

Case 1: U in position 1 -> U _ N _ E
Case 2: U in position 4 -> _ _ N U E

We can choose a word that tests one of these cases.

First, let's try to find words for Case 1: U in position 1.

Pattern: U ? N ? E

We need to fill position 2 and 4 with letters not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G

Available: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"": U, N, T, I, E -> but I is excluded (from guess 2). Invalid.
- ""UNSEE"": U, N, S, E, E -> S excluded and duplicate E? Also not a valid word? ""unsee"" might be a word, but S is excluded.
- ""UNMET"": U, N, M, E, T -> but position 5 is T, not E. We need position 5 to be E. So invalid.
- ""UNITE"": U, N, I, T, E -> I excluded.
- ""UNDUE"": U, N, D, U, E -> duplicate U? And position 5 is E? ""UNDUE"" is U-N-D-U-E, so positions: 1:U, 2:N, 3:D, 4:U, 5:E. But position 3 is D, but we need position 3 to be N. In this word, position 3 is D, not N. We cannot change position 3 because it's fixed as N.

We must keep position 3 as N and position 5 as E.

So for U in position 1: U _ N _ E

So position 2 and 4 to fill.

Examples:
- ""UPTIE"": U, P, T, I, E -> I excluded.
- ""UMPTE""? Not a word.
- ""UMBLE"": U, M, B, L, E -> L excluded.
- ""UNBED"": U, N, B, E, D -> position 3 is B? No, pattern: position 1:U, 2:N? But we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 cannot be N. In this pattern, position 2 is the second letter, and position 3 is N. So for ""U _ N _ E"", the second letter is position 2, and then position 3 is N.

So for example, ""UPNEE""? Not a word.

""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> R and A excluded, and doesn't end with E.

This is tough. Let's try Case 2: U in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N U E

So positions: 1, 2, 3=N, 4=U, 5=E

We need to fill positions 1 and 2 with letters not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,O,I,S,L,G

Available: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- ""TUNUE""? Not a word.
- ""TENUE"": T, E, N, U, E -> position 2 is E? But we have E at position 5, and also position 2 is E? But the word has two E's? ""TENUE"" is T-E-N-U-E, so positions: 1:T, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E. This is valid. But we know E is at position 5, but is there another E? Possibly. We haven't ruled out multiple E's. Also, we are testing position 2 as E, which might be correct or not.

But in this word, we have E at position 2 and 5. We know position 5 is E, but position 2 might be E or not.

But we are allowed to have duplicate letters.

Also, we are testing T and the possibility of E at position 2.

But we also have U at position 4.

Another word: ""MENU"": not 5 letters.

""DENUE""? Not common.

""PENUE""? Not a word.

""VENUE"": V, E, N, U, E -> same as ""tenue"" but with V. ""Venue"" is a word: V-E-N-U-E.

Similarly, ""venue"" has positions: 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E.

We can use this.

Another: ""MENUE""? Not standard, but ""menue"" might be archaic. ""Venue"" is better.

""BENCH"": doesn't end with E and has C.

So ""venue"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to check if E at position 2 is possible. We don't know yet.

Another word: ""TUNED"": T, U, N, E, D -> but position 4 is E and position 5 is D? Not E at end. Invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> no N, and not the pattern.

So back to ""venue"": V, E, N, U, E.

This fits the pattern: position 1:V, 2:E, 3:N, 4:U, 5:E.

We are testing:
- V at position 1
- E at position 2 (which might be present or not, but we know E is at 5, so if E is also at 2, we'll get feedback)
- U at position 4 (we know U is present, so we are testing its position)

But we already know U is present, and we are putting it at position 4. If U is at position 4 in the secret word, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know it must be at position 1.

Also, we test V.

But we are using E at position 2, which might be risky because if the word doesn't have E at position 2, we might get a minus, but we don't know if there is another E.

Not necessarily, because in ""crane"", the other positions didn't have E, so it wouldn't show. But we don't know if there is an E elsewhere.

Similarly, in ""noise"" and ""lunge"", we had E only at position 5.

So it's possible that there is only one E.

But in ""venue"", we are putting E at position 2, which might not be in the word.

But that's okay because we are testing.

Another word: ""DUNCE"" but C excluded.

""FUNKY"" no.

Perhaps ""PUNCE"" not word.

Another possibility: ""HUNKE""? Not word.

""MINUET"" is 6 letters.

Perhaps we can try a word without assuming U at position 4.

But we need to test U's position.

Another word for pattern _ _ N U E: ""THNUE""? Not word.

""WHNUE""? No.

So ""venue"" seems acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with U in position 1.

Earlier I struggled, but let's try again.

Pattern: U ? N ? E

Position 2: must be a letter, position 4: must be a letter.

Words: ""UPTIE"" has I.

""UMBRE"" not word.

""UMBER"": U, M, B, E, R -> but position 3 is B, not N. We need position 3 to be N.

So ""U?N?E"" — what words have this?

""UNWED"": U, N, W, E, D -> position 3 is W, not N? Pattern: 1:U, 2:N, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D. But we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 cannot be N. In this, position 2 is N, but we need position 3 to be N, so position 2 is different.

For ""U _ N _ E"", the second letter (position 2) is some letter, and position 3 is N.

So for example, ""UZBEK"" not ending with E.

""UDDER"" not.

""ULNAE"": U, L, N, A, E -> L and A excluded.

""URAEI""? Not word.

This is difficult. Maybe there are no common words with U at position 1, N at position 3, E at position 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

So perhaps Case 2 is better.

Another word for Case 2: _ _ N U E

""VENUE"" is one.

""DENIM"" not ending with E.

""PENNA"" not.

""JUNTA"" not.

""KNULE""? Not.

So ""venue"" seems the best option.

But in ""venue"", we have E at position 2. If the secret word does not have E at position 2, we will get a minus for that position, but we can still get information.

We also test V and the position of U.

Moreover, we know U is present, so if we put it at position 4 and it's correct, we get a check; if not, we know it must be at position 1.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""venue"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""venue"", then we get all correct.

But it might not be.

For example, if U is not at position 4, we get U as minus, and then we know U is at position 1.

Also, we learn about V and E at position 2.

So it's informative.

Another word: ""TENUE"" as I thought earlier, which is similar but with T.

""Tenue"" is a word, meaning bearing or posture, but less common than ""venue"". But both are valid.

I think ""venue"" is fine.

So we'll go with ""venue"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
     - C, R, A are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (""noise"")**:
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is in the word but not in position 1 (-).
     - O, I, S are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (""lunge"")**:
     - E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
     - N is correct and in position 3 (✓).
     - U is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
     - L and G are absent (x).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 3 is N (from ""lunge"" ✓).
     - Position 5 is E (consistent across all guesses).
   - **Confirmed Present Letters**:
     - N (position 3) and E (position 5) are confirmed.
     - U is in the word but not in position 2 (must be in position 1 or 4).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G (cannot be used).
   - **Remaining Positions**: 1, 2, and 4 need to be solved.
   - **Constraints for Next Guess**:
     - Must end with E (position 5).
     - Must include N at position 3.
     - Must include U (in position 1 or 4).
     - Avoid absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, S, L, G.
     - Test new common letters to gather information (e.g., T, D, V, M, P).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - **Test U's Position**: U must be in position 1 or 4. We can prioritize testing U in position 4 to potentially confirm its location, as position 1 can be tested later if needed.
   - **Cover New Letters**: Use untried common letters like V, E (for position 2), T, or D to maximize information. Since E is already confirmed at position 5, testing E in position 2 could reveal if there is a second E.
   - **Word Selection**: After evaluating possible words, ""venue"" fits:
     - Pattern: _ _ N U E (positions: 1, 2, 3=N, 4=U, 5=E).
     - Tests U in position 4 (if U is not here, it must be in position 1).
     - Tests V (new letter) in position 1.
     - Tests E in position 2 (to check for a second E).
     - Avoids all absent letters.

4. **Why ""venue""?**:
   - If U is in position 4, we get a ✓ for U and narrow down the word structure.
   - If U is not in position 4 (but we know it must be in position 1), we get a (-) for U and can adjust in the next guess.
   - Feedback on V and the position 2 letter (E) will help identify the remaining letters.
   - This guess efficiently uses the constraints and tests high-likelihood scenarios.",Guess 4: venue -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) E(✓) N(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
