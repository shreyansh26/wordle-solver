 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has E as the fifth letter: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, we know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N: 
   Vowels: O, I, U (but we already have E at the end, so we might need another vowel in the beginning or middle)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can try to use a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

 Some common starting letters for 5-letter words ending with E: 
   S, T, B, P, M, etc.

 Let's list some words that end with E and do not contain C, R, A, N:

 Examples:
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (from feedback: A is absent)
   ""POISE"" -> contains O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about O, I, S. Also, note that E is at the end.

 However, we must avoid A, so let's avoid words with A.

 Possible words:
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> ends with E, and no C, R, A, N.
   ""STOVE"" -> but T and O? But note: we don't know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.

 But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.

 Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.

 Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.

 But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.

 Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:

   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.

 However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.

 But let's consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

 We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.

 Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven't tried L and O.

 However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.

 But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).

 Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.

 I'll go with ""SPIKE"".

 So, the next guess: SPIKE

 But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I'll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  

A strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  
- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  
- Maintains E in the 5th position.  

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.

Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N: \n   Vowels: O, I, U (but we already have E at the end, so we might need another vowel in the beginning or middle)\n   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n We can try to use a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels.\n\n Some common starting letters for 5-letter words ending with E: \n   S, T, B, P, M, etc.\n\n Let\'s list some words that end with E and do not contain C, R, A, N:\n\n Examples:\n   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (from feedback: A is absent)\n   ""POISE"" -> contains O, I, S, E -> but we don\'t know about O, I, S. Also, note that E is at the end.\n\n However, we must avoid A, so let\'s avoid words with A.\n\n Possible words:\n   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> ends with E, and no C, R, A, N.\n   ""STOVE"" -> but T and O? But note: we don\'t know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.\n\n But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.\n\n Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don\'t know about S, L, I, M.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.\n\n Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.\n\n But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:\n\n   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E\n   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.\n\n I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.\n\n Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:\n\n   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.\n   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.\n\n However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.\n\n But let\'s consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.\n\n We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.\n\n Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven\'t tried L and O.\n\n However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.\n\n But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).\n\n Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPIKE"".\n\n So, the next guess: SPIKE\n\n But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  \nFor the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I\'ll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  \n- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  \n- Maintains E in the 5th position.  \n\nThis guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.\n\n<guess>spike</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""spike"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again correct in the 5th position (which we already knew). S, P, I, K are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word (C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K) and we know E is in the word and at the end.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at the end)
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K
- Uses new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Note: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it's present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don't know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it's not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it's not in the word, we would get an 'x'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn't say anything about duplicate E. So it's possible that the word has only one E, or more.

But to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it's at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.

We have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.

Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.

Let's think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.
- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.
- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.
- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? 
  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).
  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.

But note: we don't know if they are in the word, but we are testing.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.

""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.

We need words ending with E.

""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.

""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.

Another one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.

""JUMBE"" -> not a word.

""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.

""FUDGE"" is a word.

""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.

Another: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't end with E.

""MOULD"" -> doesn't end with E.

""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". 

""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.

""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn't work.

We must have the fifth letter as E.

So, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E

Examples of words: 
- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.
- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.
- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.

But note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that's fine.

We can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that's not common.

""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don't know about Q, but it's rare.

""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.

But let's stick to more common words.

Another: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.

""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.

So, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.

We have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's see the letters each uses:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L

We have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.

We can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.

""TOGUE"" -> not common.

""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.

""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.

""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.

""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.

""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.

We can also try to include a word that has a 'T' because T is very common. But we don't have a candidate with T? 

What about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don't know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T's and two E's. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E's? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating T.

But we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.

""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.

Similarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.

""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.

So ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.

It uses T, H, Y, M.

Y can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.

So now we have:

- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E

Which one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.

Common letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.

""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.

""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.

Since T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.

So I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THYME"".

So, the next guess: THYME

But let me confirm: 
- T: not in absent list -> allowed
- H: not in absent list -> allowed
- Y: not in absent list -> allowed
- M: not in absent list -> allowed
- E: at the end, allowed.

And the word is valid.

So, <guess>thyme</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).
4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.

### Why this guess?
I chose **THYME** because:
- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.
- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).
- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.

This guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>thyme</guess>",thyme,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""spike"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again correct in the 5th position (which we already knew). S, P, I, K are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.

  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

We need words ending with E.

""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.

- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.
- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.

But note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that's fine.

""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.

But let's stick to more common words.

Another: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.

""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.

So, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.

We have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's see the letters each uses:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L

We have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.

We can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.

""TOGUE"" -> not common.

""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.

""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.

""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.

""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.

""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.

We can also try to include a word that has a 'T' because T is very common. But we don't have a candidate with T? 

What about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don't know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T's and two E's. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed.

Also, we are repeating T.

But we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.

""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.

Similarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.

""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.

So ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.

It uses T, H, Y, M.

Y can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.

So now we have:

- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E

Which one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.

Common letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.

""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.

""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.

Since T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.

So I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THYME"".

So, the next guess: THYME

But let me confirm: 
- T: not in absent list -> allowed

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,dodge,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has E as the fifth letter: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, we know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N: 
   Vowels: O, I, U (but we already have E at the end, so we might need another vowel in the beginning or middle)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can try to use a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

 Some common starting letters for 5-letter words ending with E: 
   S, T, B, P, M, etc.

 Let's list some words that end with E and do not contain C, R, A, N:

 Examples:
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (from feedback: A is absent)
   ""POISE"" -> contains O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about O, I, S. Also, note that E is at the end.

 However, we must avoid A, so let's avoid words with A.

 Possible words:
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> ends with E, and no C, R, A, N.
   ""STOVE"" -> but T and O? But note: we don't know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.

 But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.

 Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.

 Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.

 But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.

 Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:

   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.

 However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.

 But let's consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

 We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.

 Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven't tried L and O.

 However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.

 But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).

 Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.

 I'll go with ""SPIKE"".

 So, the next guess: SPIKE

 But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I'll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  

A strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  
- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  
- Maintains E in the 5th position.  

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.

<guess>spike</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""spike"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again correct in the 5th position (which we already knew). S, P, I, K are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word (C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K) and we know E is in the word and at the end.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at the end)
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K
- Uses new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Note: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it's present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don't know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it's not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it's not in the word, we would get an 'x'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn't say anything about duplicate E. So it's possible that the word has only one E, or more.

But to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it's at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.

We have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.

Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.

Let's think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.
- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.
- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.
- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? 
  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).
  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.

But note: we don't know if they are in the word, but we are testing.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.

""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.

We need words ending with E.

""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.

""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.

Another one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.

""JUMBE"" -> not a word.

""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.

""FUDGE"" is a word.

""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.

Another: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't end with E.

""MOULD"" -> doesn't end with E.

""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". 

""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.

""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn't work.

We must have the fifth letter as E.

So, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E

Examples of words: 
- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.
- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.
- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.

But note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that's fine.

We can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that's not common.

""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don't know about Q, but it's rare.

""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.

But let's stick to more common words.

Another: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.

""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.

So, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.

We have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's see the letters each uses:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L

We have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.

We can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.

""TOGUE"" -> not common.

""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.

""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.

""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.

""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.

""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.

We can also try to include a word that has a 'T' because T is very common. But we don't have a candidate with T? 

What about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don't know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T's and two E's. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E's? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating T.

But we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.

""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.

Similarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.

""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.

So ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.

It uses T, H, Y, M.

Y can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.

So now we have:

- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E

Which one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.

Common letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.

""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.

""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.

Since T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.

So I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THYME"".

So, the next guess: THYME

But let me confirm: 
- T: not in absent list -> allowed
- H: not in absent list -> allowed
- Y: not in absent list -> allowed
- M: not in absent list -> allowed
- E: at the end, allowed.

And the word is valid.

So, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).
4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.

### Why this guess?
I chose **THYME** because:
- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.
- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).
- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.

This guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.

Let\'s list the alphabet:\n\nA to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K\n\nNote: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it\'s present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don\'t know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it\'s not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it\'s not in the word, we would get an \'x\'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn\'t say anything about duplicate E. So it\'s possible that the word has only one E, or more.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it\'s at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.\n\nWe have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.\n\nConsonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.\n- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.\n- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? \n  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).\n  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if they are in the word, but we are testing.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n\n""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.\n\n""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\n""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.\n\n""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n\n""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.\n\nAnother one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.\n\n""JUMBE"" -> not a word.\n\n""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.\n\n""FUDGE"" is a word.\n\n""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.\n\nAnother: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""MOULD"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". \n\n""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.\n\n""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have the fifth letter as E.\n\nSo, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E\n\nExamples of words: \n- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.\n- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.\n- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that\'s fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that\'s not common.\n\n""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don\'t know about Q, but it\'s rare.\n\n""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s stick to more common words.\n\nAnother: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.\n\n""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.\n\nSo, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.\n\nWe have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let\'s see the letters each uses:\n\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G\n- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L\n\nWe have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.\n\n""TOGUE"" -> not common.\n\n""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\nWe can also try to include a word that has a \'T\' because T is very common. But we don\'t have a candidate with T? \n\nWhat about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don\'t know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T\'s and two E\'s. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E\'s? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating T.\n\nBut we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.\n\n""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.\n\nSimilarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.\n\n""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.\n\nSo ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.\n\nIt uses T, H, Y, M.\n\nY can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.\n\nCommon letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.\n\n""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.\n\n""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.\n\n""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.\n\n""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.\n\nSince T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.\n\nSo I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it\'s allowed.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""THYME"".\n\nSo, the next guess: THYME\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- T: not in absent list -> allowed\n- H: not in absent list -> allowed\n- Y: not in absent list -> allowed\n- M: not in absent list -> allowed\n- E: at the end, allowed.\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nSo, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).\n3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).\n4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.\n\n### Why this guess?\nI chose **THYME** because:\n- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.\n- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).\n- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at the end and does not contain C, R, A, N.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows T, H, Y, M are absent.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M.

That's 12 unique absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

And E is present and fixed at the end.

The secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a 5-letter word ending in E using only the remaining letters.

List of remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have to form a word with four letters from this list and end with E.

Possible words:

- We need common letters or feasible combinations.

Ideas:

- Consider words with O, U, L, or G as they might be more common.

Examples:

- ""OZONE"" → O, Z, O, N, E → but N is absent (from guess1) → invalid.
- ""LOUSE"" → L, O, U, S, E → but S is absent → invalid.
- ""DOUSE"" → D, O, U, S, E → S absent → invalid.

Need to avoid absent letters.

What about ""BOOZE""? B, O, O, Z, E → but E at the end? B O O Z E → yes. Check letters: B, O, Z, E → Z is allowed? Yes. But we have O twice? And we need to check if O is in the remaining list: yes.

But is ""BOOZE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → uses B, O, Z.

Another word: ""JOULE"" → J, O, U, L, E → but in guess3, M is absent but J, O, U, L are allowed? Yes. However, we used ""joule"" earlier? It's a valid word.

But let's see the letters: J, O, U, L, E.

Absent letters we have don't include J, O, U, L.

So ""JOULE"" is possible.

Another: ""VOICE"" → V, O, I, C, E → but I and C are absent → no.

""BLOKE"" → B, L, O, K, E → K is absent → no.

""GLOVE"" → G, L, O, V, E → but in previous feedback, S,P,I,K are absent, but G, L, O, V are not in absent list? However, in guess3, H and Y and M are absent, but G, L, O, V are still allowed? Yes.

But wait, ""glove"" was considered earlier? However, we have not been told that G,L,O,V are absent yet.

But from the allowed letters: G, L, O, V are all in the remaining list.

Similarly, ""BULGE"" → B, U, L, G, E → again allowed.

But we need to pick one.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Remaining letters: We have 13 letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to cover four of these.

""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → and E. This tests J, O, U, L.

""VOLE"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

""VODKA"" → not ending in E.

""VOLVE"" → not a word.

""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → all allowed.

""GOLEM"" → not ending in E.

""WHOLE"" → W, H, O, L, E → but H is absent? From guess3, H(x) so absent. So ""WHOLE"" has H which is absent → cannot use.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" has H? Absent.

Words without H.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → tests B, O, Z.

But we have two O's? So only three distinct new letters.

""FOGEY"" → F, O, G, E, Y → but Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) so absent. Cannot use.

""DOUBT"" → no E.

""OUNCE"" → O, U, N, C, E → N and C are absent → no.

""OZONE"" again has N.

What about ""QUOTE""? Q, U, O, T, E → but T is absent? From guess3, T(x) → absent. Cannot use.

""BEVUE"" → not common.

""BLUME"" → not standard.

Let's list feasible words:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E → or ""vogue"" ends with E? V O G U E? But ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Actually, ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Standard spelling V-O-G-U-E? In 5 letters? V-O-G-U-E is 5 letters: V, O, G, U, E.

But is U before E? Positions: V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — yes.

Letters: V, O, G, U, E — all in the allowed list? Yes.

So ""VOGUE"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""HOWFF"" → not ending in E.

""WOLVE"" → W, O, L, V, E → is this a word? ""wolve"" is not standard; usually ""wolves"". But ""wolve"" might not be valid.

""WOLVE"" is listed as archaic, but might not be accepted. Better to stick with common words.

""BOXED"" → ends with D, not E.

""FOXED"" → ends with D? F-O-X-E-D? 5 letters? Ends with D? No, we need: ? ? ? ? E.

""FOXED"" is F-O-X-E-D, which is 5 letters ending with D? No: positions: F(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), D(5). So ends with D, not E. Not valid.

""BOXEN"" → but not ending in E.

""JOWED"" → not ending in E.

""QUIFF"" → not E.

Possible words:

- ""JOULE"" (J, O, U, L, E)
- ""GLOVE"" (G, L, O, V, E)
- ""BULGE"" (B, U, L, G, E) — similar to glove, but B instead of O? B U L G E is ""bulge""
- ""VOGUE"" (V, O, G, U, E)
- ""BOOZE"" (B, O, O, Z, E)

Which one to pick? Let's choose one that has more unique letters to test more.

""VOGUE"": letters V, O, G, U → 4 distinct letters.
""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → 4 distinct.
""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → 4 distinct (same as VOGUE? VOGUE has V,O,G,U — G and U are different).

From the list:

- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E

All have 4 distinct letters except ""BOOZE"" has duplicate O.

To maximize, pick one that includes less common letters to potentially eliminate quickly?

But we have limited choices.

I think ""GLOVE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters G, L, O, V.

But O and L are vowels/consonants.

Alternatively, ""JOULE"" has J which is less common; if J is absent, we eliminate it.

But in the context of testing, ""GLOVE"" might be better.

Another word: ""BOUTE"" → not common.

""DOUCE"" → D, O, U, C, E → but C is absent → invalid.

""FOULE"" → F, O, U, L, E → valid? ""foule"" is a word? Not common; usually ""foul"".

""FUGUE"" → F, U, G, U, E → has two U's? F-U-G-U-E → but that's 5? F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — but U repeated.

But allowed? Letters F, U, G → and E. Testable.

""FUGUE"" uses F, U, G.

Similarly, ""DOGE"" is 4 letters.

""LOGUE"" → not common.

I'll go with ""GLOVE"" as a safe option.

But we must avoid H? etc. GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E — all allowed.

So guess ""glove"".

Or ""vogue"" to avoid repetition of concepts? But glove is fine.

Given few options, I think ""GLOVE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a word with W or X or Z.

""WAZOO"" → not ending in E.

""ZEUGL"" → not a word.

""ZOOEA"" → not ending in E.

""ZOUKE"" → not common.

Perhaps ""GLOVE"" is best.

But another thought: in ""thyme"" we guessed M and it was absent, but in ""glove"" we have no M.

So it's fine.

Therefore, I choose ""glove"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  
  - S, P, I, K are absent.  
- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is still in slot 5.  
  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  
2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  
   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  
   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  

### Why ""GLOVE""?  
- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  
- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  
  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  
  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  
- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  

If G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  
- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  
- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").  

<guess>glove</guess>",glove,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at the end and does not contain C, R, A, N.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows T, H, Y, M are absent.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M.

That's 12 unique absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

And E is present and fixed at the end.

The secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a 5-letter word ending in E using only the remaining letters.

List of remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have to form a word with four letters from this list and end with E.

Possible words:

- We need common letters or feasible combinations.

Ideas:

- Consider words with O, U, L, or G as they might be more common.

Examples:

- ""OZONE"" → O, Z, O, N, E → but N is absent (from guess1) → invalid.
- ""LOUSE"" → L, O, U, S, E → but S is absent → invalid.
- ""DOUSE"" → D, O, U, S, E → S absent → invalid.

Need to avoid absent letters.

What about ""BOOZE""? B, O, O, Z, E → but E at the end? B O O Z E → yes. Check letters: B, O, Z, E → Z is allowed? Yes. But we have O twice? And we need to check if O is in the remaining list: yes.

But is ""BOOZE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → uses B, O, Z.

Another word: ""JOULE"" → J, O, U, L, E → but in guess3, M is absent but J, O, U, L are allowed? Yes. However, we used ""joule"" earlier? It's a valid word.

But let's see the letters: J, O, U, L, E.

Absent letters we have don't include J, O, U, L.

So ""JOULE"" is possible.

Another: ""VOICE"" → V, O, I, C, E → but I and C are absent → no.

""BLOKE"" → B, L, O, K, E → K is absent → no.

""GLOVE"" → G, L, O, V, E → but in previous feedback, S,P,I,K are absent, but G, L, O, V are not in absent list? However, in guess3, H and Y and M are absent, but G, L, O, V are still allowed? Yes.

But wait, ""glove"" was considered earlier? However, we have not been told that G,L,O,V are absent yet.

But from the allowed letters: G, L, O, V are all in the remaining list.

Similarly, ""BULGE"" → B, U, L, G, E → again allowed.

But we need to pick one.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Remaining letters: We have 13 letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to cover four of these.

""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → and E. This tests J, O, U, L.

""VOLE"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

""VODKA"" → not ending in E.

""VOLVE"" → not a word.

""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → all allowed.

""GOLEM"" → not ending in E.

""WHOLE"" → W, H, O, L, E → but H is absent? From guess3, H(x) so absent. So ""WHOLE"" has H which is absent → cannot use.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" has H? Absent.

Words without H.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → tests B, O, Z.

But we have two O's? So only three distinct new letters.

""FOGEY"" → F, O, G, E, Y → but Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) so absent. Cannot use.

""DOUBT"" → no E.

""OUNCE"" → O, U, N, C, E → N and C are absent → no.

""OZONE"" again has N.

What about ""QUOTE""? Q, U, O, T, E → but T is absent? From guess3, T(x) → absent. Cannot use.

""BEVUE"" → not common.

""BLUME"" → not standard.

Let's list feasible words:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E → or ""vogue"" ends with E? V O G U E? But ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Actually, ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Standard spelling V-O-G-U-E? In 5 letters? V-O-G-U-E is 5 letters: V, O, G, U, E.

But is U before E? Positions: V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — yes.

Letters: V, O, G, U, E — all in the allowed list? Yes.

So ""VOGUE"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""HOWFF"" → not ending in E.

""WOLVE"" → W, O, L, V, E → is this a word? ""wolve"" is not standard; usually ""wolves"". But ""wolve"" might not be valid.

""WOLVE"" is listed as archaic, but might not be accepted. Better to stick with common words.

""BOXED"" → ends with D, not E.

""FOXED"" → ends with D? F-O-X-E-D? 5 letters? Ends with D? No, we need: ? ? ? ? E.

""FOXED"" is F-O-X-E-D, which is 5 letters ending with D? No: positions: F(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), D(5). So ends with D, not E. Not valid.

""BOXEN"" → but not ending in E.

""JOWED"" → not ending in E.

""QUIFF"" → not E.

Possible words:

- ""JOULE"" (J, O, U, L, E)
- ""GLOVE"" (G, L, O, V, E)
- ""BULGE"" (B, U, L, G, E) — similar to glove, but B instead of O? B U L G E is ""bulge""
- ""VOGUE"" (V, O, G, U, E)
- ""BOOZE"" (B, O, O, Z, E)

Which one to pick? Let's choose one that has more unique letters to test more.

""VOGUE"": letters V, O, G, U → 4 distinct letters.
""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → 4 distinct.
""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → 4 distinct (same as VOGUE? VOGUE has V,O,G,U — G and U are different).

From the list:

- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E

All have 4 distinct letters except ""BOOZE"" has duplicate O.

To maximize, pick one that includes less common letters to potentially eliminate quickly?

But we have limited choices.

I think ""GLOVE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters G, L, O, V.

But O and L are vowels/consonants.

Alternatively, ""JOULE"" has J which is less common; if J is absent, we eliminate it.

But in the context of testing, ""GLOVE"" might be better.

Another word: ""BOUTE"" → not common.

""DOUCE"" → D, O, U, C, E → but C is absent → invalid.

""FOULE"" → F, O, U, L, E → valid? ""foule"" is a word? Not common; usually ""foul"".

""FUGUE"" → F, U, G, U, E → has two U's? F-U-G-U-E → but that's 5? F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — but U repeated.

But allowed? Letters F, U, G → and E. Testable.

""FUGUE"" uses F, U, G.

Similarly, ""DOGE"" is 4 letters.

""LOGUE"" → not common.

I'll go with ""GLOVE"" as a safe option.

But we must avoid H? etc. GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E — all allowed.

So guess ""glove"".

Or ""vogue"" to avoid repetition of concepts? But glove is fine.

Given few options, I think ""GLOVE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a word with W or X or Z.

""WAZOO"" → not ending in E.

""ZEUGL"" → not a word.

""ZOOEA"" → not ending in E.

""ZOUKE"" → not common.

Perhaps ""GLOVE"" is best.

But another thought: in ""thyme"" we guessed M and it was absent, but in ""glove"" we have no M.

So it's fine.

Therefore, I choose ""glove"".

<guess>glove</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  
  - S, P, I, K are absent.  
- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is still in slot 5.  
  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  
2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  
   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  
   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  

### Why ""GLOVE""?  
- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  
- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  
  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  
  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  
- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  

If G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  
- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  
- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").",Guess 4: glove -> FEEDBACK: G(-) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has E as the fifth letter: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, we know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N: 
   Vowels: O, I, U (but we already have E at the end, so we might need another vowel in the beginning or middle)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can try to use a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

 Some common starting letters for 5-letter words ending with E: 
   S, T, B, P, M, etc.

 Let's list some words that end with E and do not contain C, R, A, N:

 Examples:
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (from feedback: A is absent)
   ""POISE"" -> contains O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about O, I, S. Also, note that E is at the end.

 However, we must avoid A, so let's avoid words with A.

 Possible words:
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> ends with E, and no C, R, A, N.
   ""STOVE"" -> but T and O? But note: we don't know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.

 But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.

 Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.

 Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.

 But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.

 Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:

   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.

 However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.

 But let's consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

 We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.

 Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven't tried L and O.

 However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.

 But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).

 Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.

 I'll go with ""SPIKE"".

 So, the next guess: SPIKE

 But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I'll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  

A strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  
- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  
- Maintains E in the 5th position.  

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.

<guess>spike</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""spike"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again correct in the 5th position (which we already knew). S, P, I, K are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word (C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K) and we know E is in the word and at the end.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at the end)
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K
- Uses new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Note: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it's present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don't know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it's not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it's not in the word, we would get an 'x'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn't say anything about duplicate E. So it's possible that the word has only one E, or more.

But to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it's at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.

We have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.

Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.

Let's think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.
- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.
- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.
- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? 
  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).
  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.

But note: we don't know if they are in the word, but we are testing.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.

""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.

We need words ending with E.

""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.

""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.

Another one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.

""JUMBE"" -> not a word.

""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.

""FUDGE"" is a word.

""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.

Another: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't end with E.

""MOULD"" -> doesn't end with E.

""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". 

""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.

""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn't work.

We must have the fifth letter as E.

So, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E

Examples of words: 
- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.
- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.
- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.

But note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that's fine.

We can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that's not common.

""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don't know about Q, but it's rare.

""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.

But let's stick to more common words.

Another: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.

""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.

So, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.

We have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's see the letters each uses:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L

We have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.

We can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.

""TOGUE"" -> not common.

""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.

""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.

""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.

""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.

""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.

We can also try to include a word that has a 'T' because T is very common. But we don't have a candidate with T? 

What about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don't know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T's and two E's. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E's? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating T.

But we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.

""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.

Similarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.

""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.

So ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.

It uses T, H, Y, M.

Y can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.

So now we have:

- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E

Which one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.

Common letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.

""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.

""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.

Since T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.

So I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THYME"".

So, the next guess: THYME

But let me confirm: 
- T: not in absent list -> allowed
- H: not in absent list -> allowed
- Y: not in absent list -> allowed
- M: not in absent list -> allowed
- E: at the end, allowed.

And the word is valid.

So, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).
4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.

### Why this guess?
I chose **THYME** because:
- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.
- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).
- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.

This guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at the end and does not contain C, R, A, N.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows T, H, Y, M are absent.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M.

That's 12 unique absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

And E is present and fixed at the end.

The secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a 5-letter word ending in E using only the remaining letters.

List of remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have to form a word with four letters from this list and end with E.

Possible words:

- We need common letters or feasible combinations.

Ideas:

- Consider words with O, U, L, or G as they might be more common.

Examples:

- ""OZONE"" → O, Z, O, N, E → but N is absent (from guess1) → invalid.
- ""LOUSE"" → L, O, U, S, E → but S is absent → invalid.
- ""DOUSE"" → D, O, U, S, E → S absent → invalid.

Need to avoid absent letters.

What about ""BOOZE""? B, O, O, Z, E → but E at the end? B O O Z E → yes. Check letters: B, O, Z, E → Z is allowed? Yes. But we have O twice? And we need to check if O is in the remaining list: yes.

But is ""BOOZE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → uses B, O, Z.

Another word: ""JOULE"" → J, O, U, L, E → but in guess3, M is absent but J, O, U, L are allowed? Yes. However, we used ""joule"" earlier? It's a valid word.

But let's see the letters: J, O, U, L, E.

Absent letters we have don't include J, O, U, L.

So ""JOULE"" is possible.

Another: ""VOICE"" → V, O, I, C, E → but I and C are absent → no.

""BLOKE"" → B, L, O, K, E → K is absent → no.

""GLOVE"" → G, L, O, V, E → but in previous feedback, S,P,I,K are absent, but G, L, O, V are not in absent list? However, in guess3, H and Y and M are absent, but G, L, O, V are still allowed? Yes.

But wait, ""glove"" was considered earlier? However, we have not been told that G,L,O,V are absent yet.

But from the allowed letters: G, L, O, V are all in the remaining list.

Similarly, ""BULGE"" → B, U, L, G, E → again allowed.

But we need to pick one.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Remaining letters: We have 13 letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to cover four of these.

""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → and E. This tests J, O, U, L.

""VOLE"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

""VODKA"" → not ending in E.

""VOLVE"" → not a word.

""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → all allowed.

""GOLEM"" → not ending in E.

""WHOLE"" → W, H, O, L, E → but H is absent? From guess3, H(x) so absent. So ""WHOLE"" has H which is absent → cannot use.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" has H? Absent.

Words without H.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → tests B, O, Z.

But we have two O's? So only three distinct new letters.

""FOGEY"" → F, O, G, E, Y → but Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) so absent. Cannot use.

""DOUBT"" → no E.

""OUNCE"" → O, U, N, C, E → N and C are absent → no.

""OZONE"" again has N.

What about ""QUOTE""? Q, U, O, T, E → but T is absent? From guess3, T(x) → absent. Cannot use.

""BEVUE"" → not common.

""BLUME"" → not standard.

Let's list feasible words:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E → or ""vogue"" ends with E? V O G U E? But ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Actually, ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Standard spelling V-O-G-U-E? In 5 letters? V-O-G-U-E is 5 letters: V, O, G, U, E.

But is U before E? Positions: V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — yes.

Letters: V, O, G, U, E — all in the allowed list? Yes.

So ""VOGUE"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""HOWFF"" → not ending in E.

""WOLVE"" → W, O, L, V, E → is this a word? ""wolve"" is not standard; usually ""wolves"". But ""wolve"" might not be valid.

""WOLVE"" is listed as archaic, but might not be accepted. Better to stick with common words.

""BOXED"" → ends with D, not E.

""FOXED"" → ends with D? F-O-X-E-D? 5 letters? Ends with D? No, we need: ? ? ? ? E.

""FOXED"" is F-O-X-E-D, which is 5 letters ending with D? No: positions: F(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), D(5). So ends with D, not E. Not valid.

""BOXEN"" → but not ending in E.

""JOWED"" → not ending in E.

""QUIFF"" → not E.

Possible words:

- ""JOULE"" (J, O, U, L, E)
- ""GLOVE"" (G, L, O, V, E)
- ""BULGE"" (B, U, L, G, E) — similar to glove, but B instead of O? B U L G E is ""bulge""
- ""VOGUE"" (V, O, G, U, E)
- ""BOOZE"" (B, O, O, Z, E)

Which one to pick? Let's choose one that has more unique letters to test more.

""VOGUE"": letters V, O, G, U → 4 distinct letters.
""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → 4 distinct.
""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → 4 distinct (same as VOGUE? VOGUE has V,O,G,U — G and U are different).

From the list:

- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E

All have 4 distinct letters except ""BOOZE"" has duplicate O.

To maximize, pick one that includes less common letters to potentially eliminate quickly?

But we have limited choices.

I think ""GLOVE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters G, L, O, V.

But O and L are vowels/consonants.

Alternatively, ""JOULE"" has J which is less common; if J is absent, we eliminate it.

But in the context of testing, ""GLOVE"" might be better.

Another word: ""BOUTE"" → not common.

""DOUCE"" → D, O, U, C, E → but C is absent → invalid.

""FOULE"" → F, O, U, L, E → valid? ""foule"" is a word? Not common; usually ""foul"".

""FUGUE"" → F, U, G, U, E → has two U's? F-U-G-U-E → but that's 5? F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — but U repeated.

But allowed? Letters F, U, G → and E. Testable.

""FUGUE"" uses F, U, G.

Similarly, ""DOGE"" is 4 letters.

""LOGUE"" → not common.

I'll go with ""GLOVE"" as a safe option.

But we must avoid H? etc. GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E — all allowed.

So guess ""glove"".

Or ""vogue"" to avoid repetition of concepts? But glove is fine.

Given few options, I think ""GLOVE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a word with W or X or Z.

""WAZOO"" → not ending in E.

""ZEUGL"" → not a word.

""ZOOEA"" → not ending in E.

""ZOUKE"" → not common.

Perhaps ""GLOVE"" is best.

But another thought: in ""thyme"" we guessed M and it was absent, but in ""glove"" we have no M.

So it's fine.

Therefore, I choose ""glove"".

<guess>glove</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  
  - S, P, I, K are absent.  
- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is still in slot 5.  
  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  
2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  
   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  
   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  

### Why ""GLOVE""?  
- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  
- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  
  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  
  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  
- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  

If G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  
- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  
- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").

But note: we don\'t know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.\n\n But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.\n\n Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don\'t know about S, L, I, M.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.\n\n Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.\n\n But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:\n\n   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E\n   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.\n\n I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.\n\n Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:\n\n   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.\n   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.\n\n However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.\n\n But let\'s consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.\n\n We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.\n\n Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven\'t tried L and O.\n\n However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.\n\n But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).\n\n Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPIKE"".\n\n So, the next guess: SPIKE\n\n But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.\n\n Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  \nFor the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I\'ll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  \n- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  \n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  \n- Maintains E in the 5th position.  \n\nThis guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.\n\n<guess>spike</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nMeaning: E is correct and in the 5th position.

S, P, I, K are absent.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K\n\nTherefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.\n\nWe have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word (C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K) and we know E is in the word and at the end.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (since E is fixed at the end)\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K\n- Uses new letters to get more information.\n\nWhat letters are left? Let\'s list the alphabet:\n\nA to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K\n\nNote: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it\'s present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don\'t know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it\'s not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it\'s not in the word, we would get an \'x\'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn\'t say anything about duplicate E. So it\'s possible that the word has only one E, or more.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it\'s at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.\n\nWe have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.\n\nConsonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.\n- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.\n- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? \n  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).\n  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if they are in the word, but we are testing.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n\n""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.\n\n""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\n""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.\n\n""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n\n""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.\n\nAnother one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.\n\n""JUMBE"" -> not a word.\n\n""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.\n\n""FUDGE"" is a word.\n\n""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.\n\nAnother: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""MOULD"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". \n\n""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.\n\n""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have the fifth letter as E.\n\nSo, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E\n\nExamples of words: \n- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.\n- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.\n- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that\'s fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that\'s not common.\n\n""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don\'t know about Q, but it\'s rare.\n\n""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s stick to more common words.\n\nAnother: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.\n\n""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.\n\nSo, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.\n\nWe have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let\'s see the letters each uses:\n\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G\n- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L\n\nWe have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.\n\n""TOGUE"" -> not common.\n\n""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\nWe can also try to include a word that has a \'T\' because T is very common. But we don\'t have a candidate with T? \n\nWhat about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don\'t know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T\'s and two E\'s. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E\'s? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating T.\n\nBut we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.\n\n""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.\n\nSimilarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.\n\n""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.\n\nSo ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.\n\nIt uses T, H, Y, M.\n\nY can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.\n\nCommon letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.\n\n""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.\n\n""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.\n\n""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.\n\n""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.\n\nSince T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.\n\nSo I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it\'s allowed.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""THYME"".\n\nSo, the next guess: THYME\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- T: not in absent list -> allowed\n- H: not in absent list -> allowed\n- Y: not in absent list -> allowed\n- M: not in absent list -> allowed\n- E: at the end, allowed.\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nSo, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).\n3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).\n4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.\n\n### Why this guess?\nI chose **THYME** because:\n- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.\n- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).\n- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

This reveals:  \n  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  \n  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  \n  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  \n  - S, P, I, K are absent.  \n- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  \n  - E is still in slot 5.  \n  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  \n\n### Key Conclusions:\n1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  \n2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  \n3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n4. **Strategy for next guess**:  \n   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  \n   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  \n   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  \n   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  \n\n### Why ""GLOVE""?  \n- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  \n- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  \n  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  \n  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  \n- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  \n- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  \n\nIf G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  \n- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  \n- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").\n\n<guess>glove</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: glove -> FEEDBACK: G(-) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → T, H, Y, M are absent.
4. ""glove"": G(-), L(x), O(-), V(x), E(✓) → 

Breaking down feedback for ""glove"":
- G(-): G is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since position 1 is wrong, but present elsewhere).
- L(x): L is absent from the secret word.
- O(-): O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3 (and thus must be in a different position).
- V(x): V is absent.
- E(✓): E is correct at position 5 (already known).

So, new information:
- The secret word contains G and O, but neither is in its guessed position (G not at 1, O not at 3).
- L and V are absent → add to absent list.
- The positions for G and O must be among positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by G in ""glove"" but incorrect, so G is not at position 1; similarly, O is not at position 3).

Also, updating absent letters:
Absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Therefore, remaining possible letters (from the alphabet): B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

But note: G and O are confirmed present. So we must include them in the word.

Moreover, we know:
- Position 5 is E.
- The secret word has G and O somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
  - G is not at position 1 (since in ""glove"", G at 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
  - O is not at position 3 (since in ""glove"", O at 3 got ""-"").

Possible positions for G: 2, 3, or 4.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since not 3, and position 5 is E).

We must build a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains G and O (and we don't know the other two letters yet; they must be from the remaining letters).
- Avoids absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Remaining possible letters for other positions: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z. (Note: G and O are already used, so the other two can be any of these, including duplicates? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates.)

We have 2 more letters to choose (for the remaining two positions), from the set above.

The pattern: We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4 to figure out.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be G (because of the feedback from ""glove"").
- Position 3: cannot be O (from ""glove"" feedback).

Also, G must be in one of 2, 3, 4 and O in one of 1, 2, 4.

Possible placements:

Since O cannot be in position 3, and G cannot be in position 1:

Option: let the positions be P1, P2, P3, P4, P5=E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O in position 1. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4.

Case 2: O in position 2. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4? But both O and G could share position? But then that position would have two letters? One position can have only one letter.

Positions are distinct: so O and G must be in different positions.

Therefore:
- If O in P1, then G in P2, P3, or P4.
- If O in P2, then G in P1, P3, or P4 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P3 or P4.
- If O in P4, then G in P1, P2, or P3 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P2 or P3.

Similarly for G.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these and uses letters from the allowed set.

We also want to test new letters to gain information.

Since we know G and O are present, we can focus on arranging them with two other letters.

List possible words that fit:

- Must contain O and G (once each? or more? we don't know, but typically one of each unless frequent).

But possible duplicates? Let's assume one of each for now, as common.

Therefore, we need one more vowel? or consonants.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

We can form words:

Try to think of words that end with E and have O and G:

Examples:

- ""BOGUE"": B O G U E → and positions: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5=E. But is this word valid? ""bogue"" is a word (to cheat at cards or a type of fish). But let's check against constraints:

  - Position 3 is G? But in feedback from ""glove"", G was at position 1 and wrong, but we don't know about position 3 yet. But in this case, G at P3 is fine.

  - Also, O is at P2. Feedback constraint: O cannot be at P3 (from ""glove""), but here it's at P2, so okay.

  - Also, G cannot be at P1: here it's at P3, okay.

  - Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
    - B: allowed? From remaining, yes.
    - O: present (required).
    - G: present (required).
    - U: allowed? Yes (from remaining).
    - E: at end.

  - Absent letters? We don't have any absent letters in this word: B, O, G, U are not in the absent list.

  - So ""BOGUE"" is possible.

- ""GOOEY"": G O O E Y → 
  - But Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) → absent! Cannot use Y.
  - Also, duplicate O? But Y is absent → invalid.

- ""GOUGE"": G O U G E → 
  - This has two G's: positions P1:G, P2:O, P3:U, P4:G, P5:E.
  - But we know from ""glove"" feedback: G cannot be at P1 (since ""glove"" had G at P1 and it was wrong position). So if we put G at P1, that would be invalid? Actually, the secret word might have G at P1? But no: in ""glove"", when G was guessed at P1, it got ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not at P1. Therefore, G cannot be at position 1. So ""GOUGE"" has G at P1 which is forbidden → not possible.

- ""FOGUE"": F O G U E → similar to ""bogue"". Is it a word? Not common; might mean fogue gun? Or fogey? But ""fogue"" isn't standard.

- ""JOUGE"" — not a word.

- ""DOWSE"": D O W S E — S absent → invalid.

- ""JOINT"" — no E.

What other words? 

- ""BOGEY"": B O G E Y — but Y absent → invalid.

- ""DOGIE"": D O G I E — I absent → invalid.

- ""GONAD"" — no E.

- ""BOXED"" — no E at end? Ends with D.

- ""FORUM"" — no E.

Another idea: ""BOUGE"": B O U G E. Is this a word? Bouge? Archaic word for bilge? Or to avoid? Not common but might be accepted.

But similar to ""bogue"".

Alternatively, ""WOUDE"" — not common.

""OWCHE"" — not common.

We have ""BOGUE"" and perhaps ""GLOBE"" — but L is absent: from guess4, L(x) → so absent → cannot use L.

""BOUGH"" — no E.

So feasible words: ""BOGUE"" seems the best so far.

Another: ""OUTGO"" — but no E.

Or ""GOUTY"" — Y absent.

""GOWAN"" — N absent.

With U: ""UGOLD"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""GOURD"" — no E.

Wait, what about ""BOULE""? But L is absent → invalid.

""COURSE"" — C absent and S absent → no.

We might need to consider less common words.

Another possibility: ""GWINE"" — G, W, I, N, E → but I and N absent → no.

""OWING"" — no E.

Possible with Q? ""QUOGE"" — not a word.

Similarly, ""QUOTA"" — no E.

""DODGE"" — D O D G E → but D at position 1 and 3? And we don't know about D? D is allowed? Yes. But ends with E? Positions: D(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 

Check constraints:
- O at P2: allowed? No restriction on O position except it cannot be at P3 (from glove) → but P2 is fine.
- G at P4: allowed? Yes, and G not at P1, so okay.
- Also, letter D: not absent → allowed.

Is ""DODGE"" a valid word? Yes.

Also, feedback from ""glove"" does not prevent D.

Moreover, it has duplicate D? But that's acceptable.

So ""DODGE"": D O D G E.

This fits:
- Positions: P1: D, P2: O, P3: D, P4: G, P5: E.
- Constraints: 
  - O is not at P3 (it's at P2) → good.
  - G is not at P1 (it's at P4) → good.
  - Avoids absent letters: D is allowed, O and G are present, E at end.

The word is ""dodge"".

Note: the fourth letter G? But we don't have a constraint against G at P4.

Similarly, another word: ""BODGE"": B O D G E → similar: B(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).

Also valid: ""bodge"".

But which one? Both are possible.

We need to choose.

Other words: ""FODGE""? F O D G E → also possible? ""fudge"" has U instead? But we have F available.

But ""fod"" is not typical, ""fodge"" might not be common.

""JODEL"" — no E.

So between ""DODGE"", ""BODGE"", and ""BOGUE"".

But ""BOGUE"" has U: B O G U E.

We want to test if U is present? Or D?

Since we have limited guesses left (only two left? we have 6 total, guess4 was done, so guess5 now).

We need to guess correctly or get more information.

But in all cases, we are testing the arrangement.

Also, note that in the secret word, there might be a duplicate? Or simple.

Perhaps ""DODGE"" is more common than ""BOGUE"" or ""BODGE"".

But ""bodge"" is also a word (to do clumsy work).

Given the constraints, let's evaluate:

We know O and G must be in positions other than forbidden.

In ""BOGUE"":
- B at P1, O at P2, G at P3, U at P4, E at P5.

Feedback constraint: 
- In ""glove"", when O was at P3, it was ""-"" meaning not correct position. But in this guess (if secret were BOGUE), O is at P2, so it should be okay? Similarly, G at P3: in the secret word, G could be at P3? We don't know. Previously, G was only tested at P1 (wrong), but P3 hasn't been tested, so possible.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"": 
- D at P1, O at P2, D at P3, G at P4.

Both are plausible.

But we know from ""glove"" that G is present and not at P1. That's all. Similarly, O not at P3.

But in ""BOGUE"", G is at P3: no feedback tells us that P3 cannot be G? Only that O cannot be at P3. So G at P3 is new.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"", G is at P4.

To choose, we might want to test a different position for G? Or use new letters.

Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

In ""BOGUE"": we test B, U, and also G at P3.
In ""DODGE"": we test D, but D appears twice? And we test D and ... but D at P1 and P3.

Also, ""BOGUE"" tests U, while ""DODGE"" does not.

Since U is a vowel, and common, we should test it? Or test D?

We can also consider the possibility of not having U? 

Perhaps choose a word that includes U to test it.

Another word: ""GUCKS"" — no E.

Not easy.

I think ""BOGUE"" is a good bet.

But let me check if there is a word that has O at position 4? Because it's allowed.

For example, ""BUGLE"" — but L absent → invalid.

""DOGUE"" — D O G U E → similar to ""bogue"", but with D → ""dogue"" is a breed? Like dogue de Bordeaux. Might be accepted.

But structure: D O G U E → P1:D, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Now, O is at P2, so not P3, allowed.
G is at P3: not tested before? Possible.

But ""dogue"" might be less common.

Similarly, ""FOGIE"" — I absent → no.

I think ""BOGUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""FORGO"" — no E.

I'll go with ""BOGUE"".

Thus, the next guess is ""BOGUE"".

But let me confirm the arrangement:

Pattern: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Constraints:
- O is not at P3 (here it's at P2) → good.
- G is not at P1 (here it's at P3) → good.
- Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
  - B: not absent → allowed.
  - O: present → good.
  - G: present → good.
  - U: not absent → allowed.
  - E: at P5.

And the word is valid.

So <guess>bogue</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly positioned at slot 5 (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (spike)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and S, P, I, K are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (thyme)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and T, H, Y, M are absent (x).
   - **Guess 4 (glove)**:
     - G is present but not at position 1 (-).
     - L is absent (x).
     - O is present but not at position 3 (-).
     - V is absent (x).
     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Conclusions**:
   - The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
   - **G and O are present** but not in positions 1 and 3, respectively.
     - G must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
     - O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - **New absent letters**: L and V, adding to previous absentees (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M). Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V (14 letters).
   - **Possible remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.
   - Since G and O are confirmed, the secret word has 3 unknown positions (1-4) including G and O, and one additional unknown letter (positions 1-4 must include G, O, and two letters from the remaining set, but duplicates may be possible).

3. **Constraints for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **G and O**, with G not in position 1 and O not in position 3.
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).
   - Avoid all absent letters.
   - Prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., tested B, U, D).

4. **Brainstorm Valid Words**:
   - **""BOGUE""** (B O G U E): 
     - Position 1: B (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P3), U is allowed, E at P5.
     - Tests B and U as new letters.
     - Valid word meaning ""to cheat"" or a type of fish.
   - **""DODGE""** (D O D G E): 
     - Position 1: D (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P4), E at P5.
     - Tests D (duplicate allowed) but less efficient (tests fewer new letters).
     - Valid word meaning ""to avoid.""
   - **""BODGE""** (B O D G E): Similar to ""dodge"" but less common.
   - Other options like ""FOGUE"" or ""JOUGE"" are invalid or rare.

5. **Why ""BOGUE""?**:
   - Efficiently tests **B** and **U** (high-priority consonants/vowel) while satisfying position constraints for G (P3) and O (P2).
   - Covers new ground in the possible letter set (B, U not tested before).
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject positions for B, U, G, O and the unknown letter, reducing possibilities significantly.
   - Word validity confirmed (""bogue"" is in standard dictionaries).

<guess>bogue</guess>",bogue,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → T, H, Y, M are absent.
4. ""glove"": G(-), L(x), O(-), V(x), E(✓) → 

Breaking down feedback for ""glove"":
- G(-): G is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since position 1 is wrong, but present elsewhere).
- L(x): L is absent from the secret word.
- O(-): O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3 (and thus must be in a different position).
- V(x): V is absent.
- E(✓): E is correct at position 5 (already known).

So, new information:
- The secret word contains G and O, but neither is in its guessed position (G not at 1, O not at 3).
- L and V are absent → add to absent list.
- The positions for G and O must be among positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by G in ""glove"" but incorrect, so G is not at position 1; similarly, O is not at position 3).

Also, updating absent letters:
Absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Therefore, remaining possible letters (from the alphabet): B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

But note: G and O are confirmed present. So we must include them in the word.

Moreover, we know:
- Position 5 is E.
- The secret word has G and O somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
  - G is not at position 1 (since in ""glove"", G at 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
  - O is not at position 3 (since in ""glove"", O at 3 got ""-"").

Possible positions for G: 2, 3, or 4.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since not 3, and position 5 is E).

We must build a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains G and O (and we don't know the other two letters yet; they must be from the remaining letters).
- Avoids absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Remaining possible letters for other positions: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z. (Note: G and O are already used, so the other two can be any of these, including duplicates? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates.)

We have 2 more letters to choose (for the remaining two positions), from the set above.

The pattern: We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4 to figure out.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be G (because of the feedback from ""glove"").
- Position 3: cannot be O (from ""glove"" feedback).

Also, G must be in one of 2, 3, 4 and O in one of 1, 2, 4.

Possible placements:

Since O cannot be in position 3, and G cannot be in position 1:

Option: let the positions be P1, P2, P3, P4, P5=E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O in position 1. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4.

Case 2: O in position 2. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4? But both O and G could share position? But then that position would have two letters? One position can have only one letter.

Positions are distinct: so O and G must be in different positions.

Therefore:
- If O in P1, then G in P2, P3, or P4.
- If O in P2, then G in P1, P3, or P4 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P3 or P4.
- If O in P4, then G in P1, P2, or P3 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P2 or P3.

Similarly for G.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these and uses letters from the allowed set.

We also want to test new letters to gain information.

Since we know G and O are present, we can focus on arranging them with two other letters.

List possible words that fit:

- Must contain O and G (once each? or more? we don't know, but typically one of each unless frequent).

But possible duplicates? Let's assume one of each for now, as common.

Therefore, we need one more vowel? or consonants.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

We can form words:

Try to think of words that end with E and have O and G:

Examples:

- ""BOGUE"": B O G U E → and positions: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5=E. But is this word valid? ""bogue"" is a word (to cheat at cards or a type of fish). But let's check against constraints:

  - Position 3 is G? But in feedback from ""glove"", G was at position 1 and wrong, but we don't know about position 3 yet. But in this case, G at P3 is fine.

  - Also, O is at P2. Feedback constraint: O cannot be at P3 (from ""glove""), but here it's at P2, so okay.

  - Also, G cannot be at P1: here it's at P3, okay.

  - Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
    - B: allowed? From remaining, yes.
    - O: present (required).
    - G: present (required).
    - U: allowed? Yes (from remaining).
    - E: at end.

  - Absent letters? We don't have any absent letters in this word: B, O, G, U are not in the absent list.

  - So ""BOGUE"" is possible.

- ""GOOEY"": G O O E Y → 
  - But Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) → absent! Cannot use Y.
  - Also, duplicate O? But Y is absent → invalid.

- ""GOUGE"": G O U G E → 
  - This has two G's: positions P1:G, P2:O, P3:U, P4:G, P5:E.
  - But we know from ""glove"" feedback: G cannot be at P1 (since ""glove"" had G at P1 and it was wrong position). So if we put G at P1, that would be invalid? Actually, the secret word might have G at P1? But no: in ""glove"", when G was guessed at P1, it got ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not at P1. Therefore, G cannot be at position 1. So ""GOUGE"" has G at P1 which is forbidden → not possible.

- ""FOGUE"": F O G U E → similar to ""bogue"". Is it a word? Not common; might mean fogue gun? Or fogey? But ""fogue"" isn't standard.

- ""JOUGE"" — not a word.

- ""DOWSE"": D O W S E — S absent → invalid.

- ""JOINT"" — no E.

What other words? 

- ""BOGEY"": B O G E Y — but Y absent → invalid.

- ""DOGIE"": D O G I E — I absent → invalid.

- ""GONAD"" — no E.

- ""BOXED"" — no E at end? Ends with D.

- ""FORUM"" — no E.

Another idea: ""BOUGE"": B O U G E. Is this a word? Bouge? Archaic word for bilge? Or to avoid? Not common but might be accepted.

But similar to ""bogue"".

Alternatively, ""WOUDE"" — not common.

""OWCHE"" — not common.

We have ""BOGUE"" and perhaps ""GLOBE"" — but L is absent: from guess4, L(x) → so absent → cannot use L.

""BOUGH"" — no E.

So feasible words: ""BOGUE"" seems the best so far.

Another: ""OUTGO"" — but no E.

Or ""GOUTY"" — Y absent.

""GOWAN"" — N absent.

With U: ""UGOLD"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""GOURD"" — no E.

Wait, what about ""BOULE""? But L is absent → invalid.

""COURSE"" — C absent and S absent → no.

We might need to consider less common words.

Another possibility: ""GWINE"" — G, W, I, N, E → but I and N absent → no.

""OWING"" — no E.

Possible with Q? ""QUOGE"" — not a word.

Similarly, ""QUOTA"" — no E.

""DODGE"" — D O D G E → but D at position 1 and 3? And we don't know about D? D is allowed? Yes. But ends with E? Positions: D(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 

Check constraints:
- O at P2: allowed? No restriction on O position except it cannot be at P3 (from glove) → but P2 is fine.
- G at P4: allowed? Yes, and G not at P1, so okay.
- Also, letter D: not absent → allowed.

Is ""DODGE"" a valid word? Yes.

Also, feedback from ""glove"" does not prevent D.

Moreover, it has duplicate D? But that's acceptable.

So ""DODGE"": D O D G E.

This fits:
- Positions: P1: D, P2: O, P3: D, P4: G, P5: E.
- Constraints: 
  - O is not at P3 (it's at P2) → good.
  - G is not at P1 (it's at P4) → good.
  - Avoids absent letters: D is allowed, O and G are present, E at end.

The word is ""dodge"".

Note: the fourth letter G? But we don't have a constraint against G at P4.

Similarly, another word: ""BODGE"": B O D G E → similar: B(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).

Also valid: ""bodge"".

But which one? Both are possible.

We need to choose.

Other words: ""FODGE""? F O D G E → also possible? ""fudge"" has U instead? But we have F available.

But ""fod"" is not typical, ""fodge"" might not be common.

""JODEL"" — no E.

So between ""DODGE"", ""BODGE"", and ""BOGUE"".

But ""BOGUE"" has U: B O G U E.

We want to test if U is present? Or D?

Since we have limited guesses left (only two left? we have 6 total, guess4 was done, so guess5 now).

We need to guess correctly or get more information.

But in all cases, we are testing the arrangement.

Also, note that in the secret word, there might be a duplicate? Or simple.

Perhaps ""DODGE"" is more common than ""BOGUE"" or ""BODGE"".

But ""bodge"" is also a word (to do clumsy work).

Given the constraints, let's evaluate:

We know O and G must be in positions other than forbidden.

In ""BOGUE"":
- B at P1, O at P2, G at P3, U at P4, E at P5.

Feedback constraint: 
- In ""glove"", when O was at P3, it was ""-"" meaning not correct position. But in this guess (if secret were BOGUE), O is at P2, so it should be okay? Similarly, G at P3: in the secret word, G could be at P3? We don't know. Previously, G was only tested at P1 (wrong), but P3 hasn't been tested, so possible.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"": 
- D at P1, O at P2, D at P3, G at P4.

Both are plausible.

But we know from ""glove"" that G is present and not at P1. That's all. Similarly, O not at P3.

But in ""BOGUE"", G is at P3: no feedback tells us that P3 cannot be G? Only that O cannot be at P3. So G at P3 is new.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"", G is at P4.

To choose, we might want to test a different position for G? Or use new letters.

Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

In ""BOGUE"": we test B, U, and also G at P3.
In ""DODGE"": we test D, but D appears twice? And we test D and ... but D at P1 and P3.

Also, ""BOGUE"" tests U, while ""DODGE"" does not.

Since U is a vowel, and common, we should test it? Or test D?

We can also consider the possibility of not having U? 

Perhaps choose a word that includes U to test it.

Another word: ""GUCKS"" — no E.

Not easy.

I think ""BOGUE"" is a good bet.

But let me check if there is a word that has O at position 4? Because it's allowed.

For example, ""BUGLE"" — but L absent → invalid.

""DOGUE"" — D O G U E → similar to ""bogue"", but with D → ""dogue"" is a breed? Like dogue de Bordeaux. Might be accepted.

But structure: D O G U E → P1:D, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Now, O is at P2, so not P3, allowed.
G is at P3: not tested before? Possible.

But ""dogue"" might be less common.

Similarly, ""FOGIE"" — I absent → no.

I think ""BOGUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""FORGO"" — no E.

I'll go with ""BOGUE"".

Thus, the next guess is ""BOGUE"".

But let me confirm the arrangement:

Pattern: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Constraints:
- O is not at P3 (here it's at P2) → good.
- G is not at P1 (here it's at P3) → good.
- Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
  - B: not absent → allowed.
  - O: present → good.
  - G: present → good.
  - U: not absent → allowed.
  - E: at P5.

And the word is valid.

So <guess>bogue</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly positioned at slot 5 (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (spike)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and S, P, I, K are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (thyme)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and T, H, Y, M are absent (x).
   - **Guess 4 (glove)**:
     - G is present but not at position 1 (-).
     - L is absent (x).
     - O is present but not at position 3 (-).
     - V is absent (x).
     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Conclusions**:
   - The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
   - **G and O are present** but not in positions 1 and 3, respectively.
     - G must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
     - O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - **New absent letters**: L and V, adding to previous absentees (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M). Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V (14 letters).
   - **Possible remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.
   - Since G and O are confirmed, the secret word has 3 unknown positions (1-4) including G and O, and one additional unknown letter (positions 1-4 must include G, O, and two letters from the remaining set, but duplicates may be possible).

3. **Constraints for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **G and O**, with G not in position 1 and O not in position 3.
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).
   - Avoid all absent letters.
   - Prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., tested B, U, D).

4. **Brainstorm Valid Words**:
   - **""BOGUE""** (B O G U E): 
     - Position 1: B (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P3), U is allowed, E at P5.
     - Tests B and U as new letters.
     - Valid word meaning ""to cheat"" or a type of fish.
   - **""DODGE""** (D O D G E): 
     - Position 1: D (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P4), E at P5.
     - Tests D (duplicate allowed) but less efficient (tests fewer new letters).
     - Valid word meaning ""to avoid.""
   - **""BODGE""** (B O D G E): Similar to ""dodge"" but less common.
   - Other options like ""FOGUE"" or ""JOUGE"" are invalid or rare.

5. **Why ""BOGUE""?**:
   - Efficiently tests **B** and **U** (high-priority consonants/vowel) while satisfying position constraints for G (P3) and O (P2).
   - Covers new ground in the possible letter set (B, U not tested before).
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject positions for B, U, G, O and the unknown letter, reducing possibilities significantly.
   - Word validity confirmed (""bogue"" is in standard dictionaries).",Guess 5: bogue -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) G(-) U(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has E as the fifth letter: _ _ _ _ E

 Also, we know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. So we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 Since E is fixed at the end, we need to guess the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, A, N: 
   Vowels: O, I, U (but we already have E at the end, so we might need another vowel in the beginning or middle)
   Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We can try to use a word that has a good mix of common consonants and vowels.

 Some common starting letters for 5-letter words ending with E: 
   S, T, B, P, M, etc.

 Let's list some words that end with E and do not contain C, R, A, N:

 Examples:
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (from feedback: A is absent)
   ""POISE"" -> contains O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about O, I, S. Also, note that E is at the end.

 However, we must avoid A, so let's avoid words with A.

 Possible words:
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E -> ends with E, and no C, R, A, N.
   ""STOVE"" -> but T and O? But note: we don't know about T and O, but we must avoid A, C, R, N. However, S and T are common.

 But wait: in the feedback for ""crane"", we have E(✓) at the end, but also note that the first four letters were all absent. So the secret word does not have C, R, A, N anywhere.

 Therefore, we can use any letters except C, R, A, N.

 Let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We can try ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more ground.

 Another good candidate: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E.

 But let me think of more: ""SHINE"", ""STOLE"", etc. But we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Since we have E fixed at the end, we can try:

   ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to include a vowel (like O or I) and common consonants.

 I think ""SPIKE"" is a good choice because it uses S, P, I, K which are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in the word at the end. So we have 21 letters left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has two vowels to help identify vowels? But we already have E, so we might need one more vowel.

 Let me list a few words ending with E without C, R, A, N:

   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> but B, I, O, M are new.
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E -> Y is a vowel sometimes.

 However, I think ""SPIKE"" is a solid choice.

 But let's consider: we have E at the end. The secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

 We can also try ""SOUPE"" but that might not be common.

 Another common word: ""SLOPE"" -> but L and O? But we haven't tried L and O.

 However, we must avoid A, C, R, N. ""SLOPE"" has S, L, O, P, E -> all allowed.

 But I think ""SPIKE"" is good because it has S and P which are very common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STOLE"" or ""SPOLE"" (but ""spole"" is not common).

 Let me check: ""SPIKE"" is a valid word.

 I'll go with ""SPIKE"".

 So, the next guess: SPIKE

 But note: we are not sure if S, P, I, K are in the word. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback on these letters.

 Therefore, our next guess is ""spike"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, and N are absent (x), so they can be excluded from the next guess.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ _ _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids C, R, A, and N. I'll prioritize common letters like S, T, L, O, I, and P to maximize new information.  

A strong candidate is **""SPIKE""** (S, P, I, K, E):  
- Tests new common consonants (S, P, K) and a vowel (I).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).  
- Maintains E in the 5th position.  

This guess should efficiently narrow down possibilities for the first four letters.

Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is correct and in the 5th position. C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""spike"" -> S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓)
Meaning: E is again correct in the 5th position (which we already knew). S, P, I, K are absent.

So, to summarize:
- The secret word ends with E: _ _ _ _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of these letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K.

We have used 9 unique letters that are not in the word (C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K) and we know E is in the word and at the end.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is fixed at the end)
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K
- Uses new letters to get more information.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet:

A to Z, excluding: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K

Note: A is already excluded, so we remove: A, C, I, K, N, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: B, D, E, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: E is already in the word (at the end) and we know it's present. However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don't know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it's not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it's not in the word, we would get an 'x'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn't say anything about duplicate E. So it's possible that the word has only one E, or more.

But to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it's at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.

We have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.

Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.

Let's think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.

Examples:
- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.
- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.
- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.
- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? 
  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).
  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.

But note: we don't know if they are in the word, but we are testing.

Another word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.

""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? This ends with L. Not E.

We need words ending with E.

""STOLE"" -> but S is absent.

""BLOKE"" -> B, L, O, K, E -> but K is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.

""GLOVE"" seems good: G, L, O, V, E.

Another one: ""DOWSE"" -> D, O, W, S, E -> S absent.

""JUMBE"" -> not a word.

""FUDGE"" -> F, U, D, G, E -> all allowed? F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.

""FUDGE"" is a word.

""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.

Another: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn't end with E.

""MOULD"" -> doesn't end with E.

""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". 

""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.

""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn't work.

We must have the fifth letter as E.

So, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E

Examples of words: 
- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.
- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.
- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.

But note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that's fine.

We can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that's not common.

""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don't know about Q, but it's rare.

""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.

But let's stick to more common words.

Another: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.

""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.

So, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.

We have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's see the letters each uses:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L

We have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.

We can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.

""TOGUE"" -> not common.

""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.

""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.

""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.

""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.

""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.

We can also try to include a word that has a 'T' because T is very common. But we don't have a candidate with T? 

What about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don't know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T's and two E's. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E's? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating T.

But we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.

""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.

Similarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.

""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.

So ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.

It uses T, H, Y, M.

Y can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.

So now we have:

- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E
- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E

Which one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.

Common letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.

""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.

""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.

""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.

Since T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.

So I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""THYME"".

So, the next guess: THYME

But let me confirm: 
- T: not in absent list -> allowed
- H: not in absent list -> allowed
- Y: not in absent list -> allowed
- M: not in absent list -> allowed
- E: at the end, allowed.

And the word is valid.

So, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).
- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).
4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.

### Why this guess?
I chose **THYME** because:
- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.
- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).
- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.

This guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>thyme</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at the end and does not contain C, R, A, N.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms E at the end and shows T, H, Y, M are absent.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M.

That's 12 unique absent letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

And E is present and fixed at the end.

The secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We need to guess a 5-letter word ending in E using only the remaining letters.

List of remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have to form a word with four letters from this list and end with E.

Possible words:

- We need common letters or feasible combinations.

Ideas:

- Consider words with O, U, L, or G as they might be more common.

Examples:

- ""OZONE"" → O, Z, O, N, E → but N is absent (from guess1) → invalid.
- ""LOUSE"" → L, O, U, S, E → but S is absent → invalid.
- ""DOUSE"" → D, O, U, S, E → S absent → invalid.

Need to avoid absent letters.

What about ""BOOZE""? B, O, O, Z, E → but E at the end? B O O Z E → yes. Check letters: B, O, Z, E → Z is allowed? Yes. But we have O twice? And we need to check if O is in the remaining list: yes.

But is ""BOOZE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → uses B, O, Z.

Another word: ""JOULE"" → J, O, U, L, E → but in guess3, M is absent but J, O, U, L are allowed? Yes. However, we used ""joule"" earlier? It's a valid word.

But let's see the letters: J, O, U, L, E.

Absent letters we have don't include J, O, U, L.

So ""JOULE"" is possible.

Another: ""VOICE"" → V, O, I, C, E → but I and C are absent → no.

""BLOKE"" → B, L, O, K, E → K is absent → no.

""GLOVE"" → G, L, O, V, E → but in previous feedback, S,P,I,K are absent, but G, L, O, V are not in absent list? However, in guess3, H and Y and M are absent, but G, L, O, V are still allowed? Yes.

But wait, ""glove"" was considered earlier? However, we have not been told that G,L,O,V are absent yet.

But from the allowed letters: G, L, O, V are all in the remaining list.

Similarly, ""BULGE"" → B, U, L, G, E → again allowed.

But we need to pick one.

We need to test as many new letters as possible.

Remaining letters: We have 13 letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to cover four of these.

""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → and E. This tests J, O, U, L.

""VOLE"" is 4 letters? Need 5.

""VODKA"" → not ending in E.

""VOLVE"" → not a word.

""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → all allowed.

""GOLEM"" → not ending in E.

""WHOLE"" → W, H, O, L, E → but H is absent? From guess3, H(x) so absent. So ""WHOLE"" has H which is absent → cannot use.

Similarly, ""THOLE"" has H? Absent.

Words without H.

""BOOZE"": B, O, O, Z, E → tests B, O, Z.

But we have two O's? So only three distinct new letters.

""FOGEY"" → F, O, G, E, Y → but Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) so absent. Cannot use.

""DOUBT"" → no E.

""OUNCE"" → O, U, N, C, E → N and C are absent → no.

""OZONE"" again has N.

What about ""QUOTE""? Q, U, O, T, E → but T is absent? From guess3, T(x) → absent. Cannot use.

""BEVUE"" → not common.

""BLUME"" → not standard.

Let's list feasible words:

- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E → or ""vogue"" ends with E? V O G U E? But ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Actually, ""vogue"" is V-O-G-U-E? Standard spelling V-O-G-U-E? In 5 letters? V-O-G-U-E is 5 letters: V, O, G, U, E.

But is U before E? Positions: V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — yes.

Letters: V, O, G, U, E — all in the allowed list? Yes.

So ""VOGUE"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""HOWFF"" → not ending in E.

""WOLVE"" → W, O, L, V, E → is this a word? ""wolve"" is not standard; usually ""wolves"". But ""wolve"" might not be valid.

""WOLVE"" is listed as archaic, but might not be accepted. Better to stick with common words.

""BOXED"" → ends with D, not E.

""FOXED"" → ends with D? F-O-X-E-D? 5 letters? Ends with D? No, we need: ? ? ? ? E.

""FOXED"" is F-O-X-E-D, which is 5 letters ending with D? No: positions: F(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), D(5). So ends with D, not E. Not valid.

""BOXEN"" → but not ending in E.

""JOWED"" → not ending in E.

""QUIFF"" → not E.

Possible words:

- ""JOULE"" (J, O, U, L, E)
- ""GLOVE"" (G, L, O, V, E)
- ""BULGE"" (B, U, L, G, E) — similar to glove, but B instead of O? B U L G E is ""bulge""
- ""VOGUE"" (V, O, G, U, E)
- ""BOOZE"" (B, O, O, Z, E)

Which one to pick? Let's choose one that has more unique letters to test more.

""VOGUE"": letters V, O, G, U → 4 distinct letters.
""JOULE"": J, O, U, L → 4 distinct.
""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V → 4 distinct (same as VOGUE? VOGUE has V,O,G,U — G and U are different).

From the list:

- ""VOGUE"": V, O, G, U, E
- ""JOULE"": J, O, U, L, E
- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G, E
- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E

All have 4 distinct letters except ""BOOZE"" has duplicate O.

To maximize, pick one that includes less common letters to potentially eliminate quickly?

But we have limited choices.

I think ""GLOVE"" is a good choice because it uses common letters G, L, O, V.

But O and L are vowels/consonants.

Alternatively, ""JOULE"" has J which is less common; if J is absent, we eliminate it.

But in the context of testing, ""GLOVE"" might be better.

Another word: ""BOUTE"" → not common.

""DOUCE"" → D, O, U, C, E → but C is absent → invalid.

""FOULE"" → F, O, U, L, E → valid? ""foule"" is a word? Not common; usually ""foul"".

""FUGUE"" → F, U, G, U, E → has two U's? F-U-G-U-E → but that's 5? F(1), U(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — but U repeated.

But allowed? Letters F, U, G → and E. Testable.

""FUGUE"" uses F, U, G.

Similarly, ""DOGE"" is 4 letters.

""LOGUE"" → not common.

I'll go with ""GLOVE"" as a safe option.

But we must avoid H? etc. GLOVE: G, L, O, V, E — all allowed.

So guess ""glove"".

Or ""vogue"" to avoid repetition of concepts? But glove is fine.

Given few options, I think ""GLOVE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a word with W or X or Z.

""WAZOO"" → not ending in E.

""ZEUGL"" → not a word.

""ZOOEA"" → not ending in E.

""ZOUKE"" → not common.

Perhaps ""GLOVE"" is best.

But another thought: in ""thyme"" we guessed M and it was absent, but in ""glove"" we have no M.

So it's fine.

Therefore, I choose ""glove"".

<guess>glove</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  
  - S, P, I, K are absent.  
- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  
  - E is still in slot 5.  
  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  
2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  
3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
4. **Strategy for next guess**:  
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  
   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  
   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  

### Why ""GLOVE""?  
- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  
- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  
  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  
  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  
- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  

If G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  
- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  
- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").

<guess>glove</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: glove -> FEEDBACK: G(-) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word has E at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → T, H, Y, M are absent.
4. ""glove"": G(-), L(x), O(-), V(x), E(✓) → 

Breaking down feedback for ""glove"":
- G(-): G is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since position 1 is wrong, but present elsewhere).
- L(x): L is absent from the secret word.
- O(-): O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3 (and thus must be in a different position).
- V(x): V is absent.
- E(✓): E is correct at position 5 (already known).

So, new information:
- The secret word contains G and O, but neither is in its guessed position (G not at 1, O not at 3).
- L and V are absent → add to absent list.
- The positions for G and O must be among positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by G in ""glove"" but incorrect, so G is not at position 1; similarly, O is not at position 3).

Also, updating absent letters:
Absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Therefore, remaining possible letters (from the alphabet): B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

But note: G and O are confirmed present. So we must include them in the word.

Moreover, we know:
- Position 5 is E.
- The secret word has G and O somewhere in positions 1-4, but:
  - G is not at position 1 (since in ""glove"", G at 1 got ""-"", meaning it's present but wrong position).
  - O is not at position 3 (since in ""glove"", O at 3 got ""-"").

Possible positions for G: 2, 3, or 4.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since not 3, and position 5 is E).

We must build a word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains G and O (and we don't know the other two letters yet; they must be from the remaining letters).
- Avoids absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.

Remaining possible letters for other positions: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z. (Note: G and O are already used, so the other two can be any of these, including duplicates? But we don't know if the word allows duplicates.)

We have 2 more letters to choose (for the remaining two positions), from the set above.

The pattern: We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4 to figure out.

Constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be G (because of the feedback from ""glove"").
- Position 3: cannot be O (from ""glove"" feedback).

Also, G must be in one of 2, 3, 4 and O in one of 1, 2, 4.

Possible placements:

Since O cannot be in position 3, and G cannot be in position 1:

Option: let the positions be P1, P2, P3, P4, P5=E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: O in position 1. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4.

Case 2: O in position 2. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4? But both O and G could share position? But then that position would have two letters? One position can have only one letter.

Positions are distinct: so O and G must be in different positions.

Therefore:
- If O in P1, then G in P2, P3, or P4.
- If O in P2, then G in P1, P3, or P4 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P3 or P4.
- If O in P4, then G in P1, P2, or P3 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P2 or P3.

Similarly for G.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these and uses letters from the allowed set.

We also want to test new letters to gain information.

Since we know G and O are present, we can focus on arranging them with two other letters.

List possible words that fit:

- Must contain O and G (once each? or more? we don't know, but typically one of each unless frequent).

But possible duplicates? Let's assume one of each for now, as common.

Therefore, we need one more vowel? or consonants.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

We can form words:

Try to think of words that end with E and have O and G:

Examples:

- ""BOGUE"": B O G U E → and positions: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5=E. But is this word valid? ""bogue"" is a word (to cheat at cards or a type of fish). But let's check against constraints:

  - Position 3 is G? But in feedback from ""glove"", G was at position 1 and wrong, but we don't know about position 3 yet. But in this case, G at P3 is fine.

  - Also, O is at P2. Feedback constraint: O cannot be at P3 (from ""glove""), but here it's at P2, so okay.

  - Also, G cannot be at P1: here it's at P3, okay.

  - Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
    - B: allowed? From remaining, yes.
    - O: present (required).
    - G: present (required).
    - U: allowed? Yes (from remaining).
    - E: at end.

  - Absent letters? We don't have any absent letters in this word: B, O, G, U are not in the absent list.

  - So ""BOGUE"" is possible.

- ""GOOEY"": G O O E Y → 
  - But Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) → absent! Cannot use Y.
  - Also, duplicate O? But Y is absent → invalid.

- ""GOUGE"": G O U G E → 
  - This has two G's: positions P1:G, P2:O, P3:U, P4:G, P5:E.
  - But we know from ""glove"" feedback: G cannot be at P1 (since ""glove"" had G at P1 and it was wrong position). So if we put G at P1, that would be invalid? Actually, the secret word might have G at P1? But no: in ""glove"", when G was guessed at P1, it got ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not at P1. Therefore, G cannot be at position 1. So ""GOUGE"" has G at P1 which is forbidden → not possible.

- ""FOGUE"": F O G U E → similar to ""bogue"". Is it a word? Not common; might mean fogue gun? Or fogey? But ""fogue"" isn't standard.

- ""JOUGE"" — not a word.

- ""DOWSE"": D O W S E — S absent → invalid.

- ""JOINT"" — no E.

What other words? 

- ""BOGEY"": B O G E Y — but Y absent → invalid.

- ""DOGIE"": D O G I E — I absent → invalid.

- ""GONAD"" — no E.

- ""BOXED"" — no E at end? Ends with D.

- ""FORUM"" — no E.

Another idea: ""BOUGE"": B O U G E. Is this a word? Bouge? Archaic word for bilge? Or to avoid? Not common but might be accepted.

But similar to ""bogue"".

Alternatively, ""WOUDE"" — not common.

""OWCHE"" — not common.

We have ""BOGUE"" and perhaps ""GLOBE"" — but L is absent: from guess4, L(x) → so absent → cannot use L.

""BOUGH"" — no E.

So feasible words: ""BOGUE"" seems the best so far.

Another: ""OUTGO"" — but no E.

Or ""GOUTY"" — Y absent.

""GOWAN"" — N absent.

With U: ""UGOLD"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""GOURD"" — no E.

Wait, what about ""BOULE""? But L is absent → invalid.

""COURSE"" — C absent and S absent → no.

We might need to consider less common words.

Another possibility: ""GWINE"" — G, W, I, N, E → but I and N absent → no.

""OWING"" — no E.

Possible with Q? ""QUOGE"" — not a word.

Similarly, ""QUOTA"" — no E.

""DODGE"" — D O D G E → but D at position 1 and 3? And we don't know about D? D is allowed? Yes. But ends with E? Positions: D(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). 

Check constraints:
- O at P2: allowed? No restriction on O position except it cannot be at P3 (from glove) → but P2 is fine.
- G at P4: allowed? Yes, and G not at P1, so okay.
- Also, letter D: not absent → allowed.

Is ""DODGE"" a valid word? Yes.

Also, feedback from ""glove"" does not prevent D.

Moreover, it has duplicate D? But that's acceptable.

So ""DODGE"": D O D G E.

This fits:
- Positions: P1: D, P2: O, P3: D, P4: G, P5: E.
- Constraints: 
  - O is not at P3 (it's at P2) → good.
  - G is not at P1 (it's at P4) → good.
  - Avoids absent letters: D is allowed, O and G are present, E at end.

The word is ""dodge"".

Note: the fourth letter G? But we don't have a constraint against G at P4.

Similarly, another word: ""BODGE"": B O D G E → similar: B(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).

Also valid: ""bodge"".

But which one? Both are possible.

We need to choose.

Other words: ""FODGE""? F O D G E → also possible? ""fudge"" has U instead? But we have F available.

But ""fod"" is not typical, ""fodge"" might not be common.

""JODEL"" — no E.

So between ""DODGE"", ""BODGE"", and ""BOGUE"".

But ""BOGUE"" has U: B O G U E.

We want to test if U is present? Or D?

Since we have limited guesses left (only two left? we have 6 total, guess4 was done, so guess5 now).

We need to guess correctly or get more information.

But in all cases, we are testing the arrangement.

Also, note that in the secret word, there might be a duplicate? Or simple.

Perhaps ""DODGE"" is more common than ""BOGUE"" or ""BODGE"".

But ""bodge"" is also a word (to do clumsy work).

Given the constraints, let's evaluate:

We know O and G must be in positions other than forbidden.

In ""BOGUE"":
- B at P1, O at P2, G at P3, U at P4, E at P5.

Feedback constraint: 
- In ""glove"", when O was at P3, it was ""-"" meaning not correct position. But in this guess (if secret were BOGUE), O is at P2, so it should be okay? Similarly, G at P3: in the secret word, G could be at P3? We don't know. Previously, G was only tested at P1 (wrong), but P3 hasn't been tested, so possible.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"": 
- D at P1, O at P2, D at P3, G at P4.

Both are plausible.

But we know from ""glove"" that G is present and not at P1. That's all. Similarly, O not at P3.

But in ""BOGUE"", G is at P3: no feedback tells us that P3 cannot be G? Only that O cannot be at P3. So G at P3 is new.

Similarly, in ""DODGE"", G is at P4.

To choose, we might want to test a different position for G? Or use new letters.

Remaining letters to test: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.

In ""BOGUE"": we test B, U, and also G at P3.
In ""DODGE"": we test D, but D appears twice? And we test D and ... but D at P1 and P3.

Also, ""BOGUE"" tests U, while ""DODGE"" does not.

Since U is a vowel, and common, we should test it? Or test D?

We can also consider the possibility of not having U? 

Perhaps choose a word that includes U to test it.

Another word: ""GUCKS"" — no E.

Not easy.

I think ""BOGUE"" is a good bet.

But let me check if there is a word that has O at position 4? Because it's allowed.

For example, ""BUGLE"" — but L absent → invalid.

""DOGUE"" — D O G U E → similar to ""bogue"", but with D → ""dogue"" is a breed? Like dogue de Bordeaux. Might be accepted.

But structure: D O G U E → P1:D, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Now, O is at P2, so not P3, allowed.
G is at P3: not tested before? Possible.

But ""dogue"" might be less common.

Similarly, ""FOGIE"" — I absent → no.

I think ""BOGUE"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""FORGO"" — no E.

I'll go with ""BOGUE"".

Thus, the next guess is ""BOGUE"".

But let me confirm the arrangement:

Pattern: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.

Constraints:
- O is not at P3 (here it's at P2) → good.
- G is not at P1 (here it's at P3) → good.
- Letters: B, O, G, U, E → 
  - B: not absent → allowed.
  - O: present → good.
  - G: present → good.
  - U: not absent → allowed.
  - E: at P5.

And the word is valid.

So <guess>bogue</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly positioned at slot 5 (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).
   - **Guess 2 (spike)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and S, P, I, K are absent (x).
   - **Guess 3 (thyme)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and T, H, Y, M are absent (x).
   - **Guess 4 (glove)**:
     - G is present but not at position 1 (-).
     - L is absent (x).
     - O is present but not at position 3 (-).
     - V is absent (x).
     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Conclusions**:
   - The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
   - **G and O are present** but not in positions 1 and 3, respectively.
     - G must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
     - O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
   - **New absent letters**: L and V, adding to previous absentees (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M). Total absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V (14 letters).
   - **Possible remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.
   - Since G and O are confirmed, the secret word has 3 unknown positions (1-4) including G and O, and one additional unknown letter (positions 1-4 must include G, O, and two letters from the remaining set, but duplicates may be possible).

3. **Constraints for Next Guess**:
   - Must include **G and O**, with G not in position 1 and O not in position 3.
   - Must end with **E** (position 5).
   - Avoid all absent letters.
   - Prioritize common letters to maximize information (e.g., tested B, U, D).

4. **Brainstorm Valid Words**:
   - **""BOGUE""** (B O G U E): 
     - Position 1: B (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P3), U is allowed, E at P5.
     - Tests B and U as new letters.
     - Valid word meaning ""to cheat"" or a type of fish.
   - **""DODGE""** (D O D G E): 
     - Position 1: D (allowed), O not at P3 (O is at P2), G not at P1 (G is at P4), E at P5.
     - Tests D (duplicate allowed) but less efficient (tests fewer new letters).
     - Valid word meaning ""to avoid.""
   - **""BODGE""** (B O D G E): Similar to ""dodge"" but less common.
   - Other options like ""FOGUE"" or ""JOUGE"" are invalid or rare.

5. **Why ""BOGUE""?**:
   - Efficiently tests **B** and **U** (high-priority consonants/vowel) while satisfying position constraints for G (P3) and O (P2).
   - Covers new ground in the possible letter set (B, U not tested before).
   - If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject positions for B, U, G, O and the unknown letter, reducing possibilities significantly.
   - Word validity confirmed (""bogue"" is in standard dictionaries).

However, E might appear again? But in the feedback, we only know that the 5th letter is E. It could be that E appears only once, or more? But we don\'t know. However, since we are forced to put E at the end, we can try to use E only at the end to avoid confusion? But if we use E in another position and it\'s not in the word (or if it is, we get feedback) but we know E is at the end, so if we put E in another position and it\'s not in the word, we would get an \'x\'. But to be safe, we might avoid using E in other positions for now to save letters? However, we have limited letters left.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" and ""spike"" only told us that the 5th letter is E and the other letters are absent. It didn\'t say anything about duplicate E. So it\'s possible that the word has only one E, or more.\n\nBut to maximize new information, we should avoid using E in positions 1-4 because we already know it\'s at position 5. We can use other vowels or consonants.\n\nWe have the following vowels left: O, U (and sometimes Y). E is already used.\n\nConsonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word ending with E, without the absent letters, and using as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: T, L, M, D, G, B, H, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending with E that use the remaining letters.\n\nExamples:\n- ""TABLE"" -> but A is absent (from guess1) -> not allowed.\n- ""LATHE"" -> A absent -> not allowed.\n- ""MOVIE"" -> but O, V, I, E -> I is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n- ""GLOVE"" -> G, L, O, V, E -> all these letters are allowed? \n  - G: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, V: allowed, E: allowed (at end).\n  - But we must check if these letters are not in the absent list: yes, they are all in the remaining set.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if they are in the word, but we are testing.\n\nAnother word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> but S is absent (from guess2) -> not allowed.\n\n""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> S absent.\n\n""TOWEL"" -> T, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E?

F, U, D, G are in the remaining set.\n\n""FUDGE"" is a word.\n\n""GLOVE"" and ""FUDGE"" are both candidates.\n\nAnother: ""TOUCH"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""MOULD"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""BOWLE"" -> not common, and ends with E? But ""bowle"" is not standard, usually ""bowl"" or ""bowled"". \n\n""BOWEL"" -> B, O, W, E, L -> but we need to end with E? ""BOWEL"" ends with L. We need the fifth letter to be E, so the word must be of the form ? ? ? ? E.\n\n""BOWEL"" is B O W E L -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L -> but we need 5th to be E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe must have the fifth letter as E.\n\nSo, the word must be: ? ? ? ? E\n\nExamples of words: \n- ""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> positions: 1:G, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> good.\n- ""FUDGE"" -> F U D G E -> 1:F, 2:U, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E -> good.\n- ""BULGE"" -> B U L G E -> but L and G? 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:G, 5:E -> good. And letters: B, U, L, G, E -> all allowed.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, so we are not testing E again in the 4th position? In ""BULGE"", the 4th letter is G and 5th is E. We are not putting E in the 4th. So that\'s fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""MOULE"" -> but that\'s not common.\n\n""TOQUE"" -> T, O, Q, U, E -> Q is allowed? Yes, and T, O, U, E -> but we don\'t know about Q, but it\'s rare.\n\n""JOULE"" -> J, O, U, L, E -> J is allowed? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s stick to more common words.\n\nAnother: ""HOOVE"" -> not common.\n\n""WHOLE"" -> W, H, O, L, E -> but we need to end with E? W H O L E -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:E -> perfect. And letters: W, H, O, L, E -> all are in the allowed set.\n\nSo, ""WHOLE"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""THOLE"" -> but less common.\n\nWe have several options: ""GLOVE"", ""FUDGE"", ""BULGE"", ""WHOLE"".\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let\'s see the letters each uses:\n\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G\n- ""BULGE"": B, U, L, G\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L\n\nWe have 18 letters left (from the 26, minus 8 absent: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K, and note E is present but we are using it at the end). We want to test as many as possible.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOGIE"" -> but that has G and E, but D, O, G, I, E -> I is absent -> not allowed.\n\n""TOGUE"" -> not common.\n\n""JOULE"" uses J, O, U, L, E -> J is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""FUDGE"" uses F, U, D, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""WHOLE"" uses W, H, O, L, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""GLOVE"" uses G, L, O, V, E -> 4 new letters.\n\n""BULGE"" uses B, U, L, G, E -> 4 new letters.\n\nWe can also try to include a word that has a \'T\' because T is very common. But we don\'t have a candidate with T? \n\nWhat about ""TUTEE"" -> but T, U, T, E, E -> we don\'t know if T is allowed, but we can use it. However, it has two T\'s and two E\'s. But we are forced to have E at the end, so the last E is fixed. The first E in ""TUTEE"" is at position 4? T U T E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:E -> but we have two E\'s? And we are using E at position 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating T.\n\nBut we can try to form a word with T. For example, ""THYME"" -> T, H, Y, M, E -> all allowed? T, H, Y, M, E -> yes.\n\n""THYME"" is a word: T H Y M E.\n\nSimilarly, ""STYLE"" -> but S is absent.\n\n""CHIME"" -> C and H? C is absent.\n\nSo ""THYME"" is a good one: T, H, Y, M, E.\n\nIt uses T, H, Y, M.\n\nY can be a vowel or consonant, but we are testing it.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n- ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E\n- ""WHOLE"": W, H, O, L, E\n- ""GLOVE"": G, L, O, V, E\n- ""FUDGE"": F, U, D, G, E\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to cover letters that are more common.\n\nCommon letters in English: T, H, O, L, M, etc.\n\n""THYME"" has T and H which are very common.\n\n""WHOLE"" has W, H, O, L.\n\n""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V.\n\n""FUDGE"" has F, U, D, G.\n\nSince T is the most common letter, we might want to test T. Also, H is common.\n\nSo I think ""THYME"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters, and T is not in the absent list, so it\'s allowed.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""THYME"".\n\nSo, the next guess: THYME\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- T: not in absent list -> allowed\n- H: not in absent list -> allowed\n- Y: not in absent list -> allowed\n- M: not in absent list -> allowed\n- E: at the end, allowed.\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nSo, <guess>thyme</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → E is correct and in the 5th position (✓), while C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n- **Guess 2: SPIKE** → E is again confirmed in the 5th position (✓), while S, P, I, K are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n2. **Absent letters (must avoid)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K (8 letters eliminated).\n3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (17 letters available).\n4. **Strategy**: Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, H, L, O, M) in a valid 5-letter word ending in E. Avoid repeating absent letters and reuse E only in the 5th position to maximize new information.\n\n### Why this guess?\nI chose **THYME** because:\n- It ends with **E**, maintaining the known 5th-letter position.\n- It uses 4 new, high-frequency letters: **T** (very common), **H**, **Y**, and **M**.\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K).\n- Testing T and H is efficient, as they are among the most common consonants in English.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of T, H, Y, or M are in the secret word and their positions, significantly narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>thyme</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

Positions: V(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) — yes.\n\nLetters: V, O, G, U, E — all in the allowed list?

But glove is fine.\n\nGiven few options, I think ""GLOVE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word with W or X or Z.\n\n""WAZOO"" → not ending in E.\n\n""ZEUGL"" → not a word.\n\n""ZOOEA"" → not ending in E.\n\n""ZOUKE"" → not common.\n\nPerhaps ""GLOVE"" is best.\n\nBut another thought: in ""thyme"" we guessed M and it was absent, but in ""glove"" we have no M.\n\nSo it\'s fine.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""glove"".\n\n<guess>glove</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓). This reveals:  \n  - E is in the secret word and correctly positioned at slot 5.  \n  - C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: spike** → Feedback: S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓). This reveals:  \n  - E is confirmed in slot 5 (redundant with prior feedback).  \n  - S, P, I, K are absent.  \n- **Guess 3: thyme** → Feedback: T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓). This reveals:  \n  - E is still in slot 5.  \n  - T, H, Y, M are absent.  \n\n### Key Conclusions:\n1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ _ _ E` (E is fixed in position 5).  \n2. **Total absent letters (12)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M. These cannot appear in the secret word.  \n3. **Possible remaining letters (13)**: B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n4. **Strategy for next guess**:  \n   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in E (position 5).  \n   - Must only use letters from the remaining possible set (B, D, F, G, J, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  \n   - Prioritize common letters to test maximum new information (e.g., G, L, O, U).  \n   - Avoid reusing absent letters.  \n\n### Why ""GLOVE""?  \n- **Word structure**: G L O V E (ends with E, adhering to the pattern).  \n- **Letters tested**: G, L, O, V (all new, from the remaining set).  \n  - These cover high-frequency consonants (G, L, V) and a vowel (O).  \n  - Testing these may quickly reveal presence/absence and positions.  \n- **Validity**: ""Glove"" is a common English word.  \n- **Efficiency**: Maximizes coverage of untested letters—especially useful since the secret word must draw from very few options now.  \n\nIf G, L, O, or V are absent or misplaced, the feedback will significantly narrow down possibilities. For example:  \n- If O is misplaced, it might fit in position 2–4.  \n- If all feedback shows ""x"" for new letters, the secret word likely uses rarer letters like Q, X, or Z (e.g., ""VOUGE"" or ""BOOZE"").\n\n<guess>glove</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spike -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) K(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: thyme -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) Y(x) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: glove -> FEEDBACK: G(-) L(x) O(-) V(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from four guesses:\n\n1.

""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → T, H, Y, M are absent.\n4. ""glove"": G(-), L(x), O(-), V(x), E(✓) → \n\nBreaking down feedback for ""glove"":\n- G(-): G is in the secret word but NOT in position 1 (since position 1 is wrong, but present elsewhere).\n- L(x): L is absent from the secret word.\n- O(-): O is in the secret word but NOT in position 3 (and thus must be in a different position).\n- V(x): V is absent.\n- E(✓): E is correct at position 5 (already known).\n\nSo, new information:\n- The secret word contains G and O, but neither is in its guessed position (G not at 1, O not at 3).\n- L and V are absent → add to absent list.\n- The positions for G and O must be among positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is taken by G in ""glove"" but incorrect, so G is not at position 1; similarly, O is not at position 3).\n\nAlso, updating absent letters:\nAbsent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.\n\nTherefore, remaining possible letters (from the alphabet): B, D, F, G, J, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.\n\nBut note: G and O are confirmed present. So we must include them in the word.\n\nMoreover, we know:\n- Position 5 is E.\n- The secret word has G and O somewhere in positions 1-4, but:\n  - G is not at position 1 (since in ""glove"", G at 1 got ""-"", meaning it\'s present but wrong position).\n  - O is not at position 3 (since in ""glove"", O at 3 got ""-"").\n\nPossible positions for G: 2, 3, or 4.\nPossible positions for O: 1, 2, or 4 (since not 3, and position 5 is E).\n\nWe must build a word that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Contains G and O (and we don\'t know the other two letters yet; they must be from the remaining letters).\n- Avoids absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V.\n\nRemaining possible letters for other positions: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z. (Note: G and O are already used, so the other two can be any of these, including duplicates? But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates.)\n\nWe have 2 more letters to choose (for the remaining two positions), from the set above.\n\nThe pattern: We have positions 1, 2, 3, 4 to figure out.\n\nConstraints:\n- Position 1: cannot be G (because of the feedback from ""glove"").\n- Position 3: cannot be O (from ""glove"" feedback).\n\nAlso, G must be in one of 2, 3, 4 and O in one of 1, 2, 4.\n\nPossible placements:\n\nSince O cannot be in position 3, and G cannot be in position 1:\n\nOption: let the positions be P1, P2, P3, P4, P5=E.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: O in position 1. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4.\n\nCase 2: O in position 2. Then G can be in 2, 3, or 4? But both O and G could share position? But then that position would have two letters? One position can have only one letter.\n\nPositions are distinct: so O and G must be in different positions.\n\nTherefore:\n- If O in P1, then G in P2, P3, or P4.\n- If O in P2, then G in P1, P3, or P4 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P3 or P4.\n- If O in P4, then G in P1, P2, or P3 — but P1 cannot be G, so G in P2 or P3.\n\nSimilarly for G.\n\nWe need to choose a word that satisfies these and uses letters from the allowed set.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to gain information.\n\nSince we know G and O are present, we can focus on arranging them with two other letters.\n\nList possible words that fit:\n\n- Must contain O and G (once each? or more? we don\'t know, but typically one of each unless frequent).\n\nBut possible duplicates? Let\'s assume one of each for now, as common.\n\nTherefore, we need one more vowel? or consonants.\n\nRemaining letters: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.\n\nWe can form words:\n\nTry to think of words that end with E and have O and G:\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""BOGUE"": B O G U E → and positions: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5=E. But is this word valid? ""bogue"" is a word (to cheat at cards or a type of fish). But let\'s check against constraints:\n\n  - Position 3 is G? But in feedback from ""glove"", G was at position 1 and wrong, but we don\'t know about position 3 yet. But in this case, G at P3 is fine.\n\n  - Also, O is at P2. Feedback constraint: O cannot be at P3 (from ""glove""), but here it\'s at P2, so okay.\n\n  - Also, G cannot be at P1: here it\'s at P3, okay.\n\n  - Letters: B, O, G, U, E → \n    - B: allowed? From remaining, yes.\n    - O: present (required).\n    - G: present (required).\n    - U: allowed? Yes (from remaining).\n    - E: at end.\n\n  - Absent letters? We don\'t have any absent letters in this word: B, O, G, U are not in the absent list.\n\n  - So ""BOGUE"" is possible.\n\n- ""GOOEY"": G O O E Y → \n  - But Y is absent? From guess3, Y(x) → absent! Cannot use Y.\n  - Also, duplicate O? But Y is absent → invalid.\n\n- ""GOUGE"": G O U G E → \n  - This has two G\'s: positions P1:G, P2:O, P3:U, P4:G, P5:E.\n  - But we know from ""glove"" feedback: G cannot be at P1 (since ""glove"" had G at P1 and it was wrong position). So if we put G at P1, that would be invalid? Actually, the secret word might have G at P1? But no: in ""glove"", when G was guessed at P1, it got ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not at P1. Therefore, G cannot be at position 1. So ""GOUGE"" has G at P1 which is forbidden → not possible.\n\n- ""FOGUE"": F O G U E → similar to ""bogue"". Is it a word? Not common; might mean fogue gun? Or fogey? But ""fogue"" isn\'t standard.\n\n- ""JOUGE"" — not a word.\n\n- ""DOWSE"": D O W S E — S absent → invalid.\n\n- ""JOINT"" — no E.\n\nWhat other words? \n\n- ""BOGEY"": B O G E Y — but Y absent → invalid.\n\n- ""DOGIE"": D O G I E — I absent → invalid.\n\n- ""GONAD"" — no E.\n\n- ""BOXED"" — no E at end? Ends with D.\n\n- ""FORUM"" — no E.\n\nAnother idea: ""BOUGE"": B O U G E. Is this a word? Bouge? Archaic word for bilge? Or to avoid? Not common but might be accepted.\n\nBut similar to ""bogue"".\n\nAlternatively, ""WOUDE"" — not common.\n\n""OWCHE"" — not common.\n\nWe have ""BOGUE"" and perhaps ""GLOBE"" — but L is absent: from guess4, L(x) → so absent → cannot use L.\n\n""BOUGH"" — no E.\n\nSo feasible words: ""BOGUE"" seems the best so far.\n\nAnother: ""OUTGO"" — but no E.\n\nOr ""GOUTY"" — Y absent.\n\n""GOWAN"" — N absent.\n\nWith U: ""UGOLD"" — not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""GOURD"" — no E.\n\nWait, what about ""BOULE""? But L is absent → invalid.\n\n""COURSE"" — C absent and S absent → no.\n\nWe might need to consider less common words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GWINE"" — G, W, I, N, E → but I and N absent → no.\n\n""OWING"" — no E.\n\nPossible with Q? ""QUOGE"" — not a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUOTA"" — no E.\n\n""DODGE"" — D O D G E → but D at position 1 and 3? And we don\'t know about D? D is allowed? Yes. But ends with E? Positions: D(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5). \n\nCheck constraints:\n- O at P2: allowed? No restriction on O position except it cannot be at P3 (from glove) → but P2 is fine.\n- G at P4: allowed? Yes, and G not at P1, so okay.\n- Also, letter D: not absent → allowed.\n\nIs ""DODGE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAlso, feedback from ""glove"" does not prevent D.\n\nMoreover, it has duplicate D? But that\'s acceptable.\n\nSo ""DODGE"": D O D G E.\n\nThis fits:\n- Positions: P1: D, P2: O, P3: D, P4: G, P5: E.\n- Constraints: \n  - O is not at P3 (it\'s at P2) → good.\n  - G is not at P1 (it\'s at P4) → good.\n  - Avoids absent letters: D is allowed, O and G are present, E at end.\n\nThe word is ""dodge"".\n\nNote: the fourth letter G? But we don\'t have a constraint against G at P4.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""BODGE"": B O D G E → similar: B(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).\n\nAlso valid: ""bodge"".\n\nBut which one? Both are possible.\n\nWe need to choose.\n\nOther words: ""FODGE""? F O D G E → also possible? ""fudge"" has U instead? But we have F available.\n\nBut ""fod"" is not typical, ""fodge"" might not be common.\n\n""JODEL"" — no E.\n\nSo between ""DODGE"", ""BODGE"", and ""BOGUE"".\n\nBut ""BOGUE"" has U: B O G U E.\n\nWe want to test if U is present? Or D?\n\nSince we have limited guesses left (only two left? we have 6 total, guess4 was done, so guess5 now).\n\nWe need to guess correctly or get more information.\n\nBut in all cases, we are testing the arrangement.\n\nAlso, note that in the secret word, there might be a duplicate? Or simple.\n\nPerhaps ""DODGE"" is more common than ""BOGUE"" or ""BODGE"".\n\nBut ""bodge"" is also a word (to do clumsy work).\n\nGiven the constraints, let\'s evaluate:\n\nWe know O and G must be in positions other than forbidden.\n\nIn ""BOGUE"":\n- B at P1, O at P2, G at P3, U at P4, E at P5.\n\nFeedback constraint: \n- In ""glove"", when O was at P3, it was ""-"" meaning not correct position. But in this guess (if secret were BOGUE), O is at P2, so it should be okay? Similarly, G at P3: in the secret word, G could be at P3? We don\'t know. Previously, G was only tested at P1 (wrong), but P3 hasn\'t been tested, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DODGE"": \n- D at P1, O at P2, D at P3, G at P4.\n\nBoth are plausible.\n\nBut we know from ""glove"" that G is present and not at P1. That\'s all. Similarly, O not at P3.\n\nBut in ""BOGUE"", G is at P3: no feedback tells us that P3 cannot be G? Only that O cannot be at P3. So G at P3 is new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""DODGE"", G is at P4.\n\nTo choose, we might want to test a different position for G? Or use new letters.\n\nRemaining letters to test: B, D, F, J, Q, U, W, X, Z.\n\nIn ""BOGUE"": we test B, U, and also G at P3.\nIn ""DODGE"": we test D, but D appears twice? And we test D and ... but D at P1 and P3.\n\nAlso, ""BOGUE"" tests U, while ""DODGE"" does not.\n\nSince U is a vowel, and common, we should test it? Or test D?\n\nWe can also consider the possibility of not having U? \n\nPerhaps choose a word that includes U to test it.\n\nAnother word: ""GUCKS"" — no E.\n\nNot easy.\n\nI think ""BOGUE"" is a good bet.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word that has O at position 4? Because it\'s allowed.\n\nFor example, ""BUGLE"" — but L absent → invalid.\n\n""DOGUE"" — D O G U E → similar to ""bogue"", but with D → ""dogue"" is a breed? Like dogue de Bordeaux. Might be accepted.\n\nBut structure: D O G U E → P1:D, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.\n\nNow, O is at P2, so not P3, allowed.\nG is at P3: not tested before? Possible.\n\nBut ""dogue"" might be less common.\n\nSimilarly, ""FOGIE"" — I absent → no.\n\nI think ""BOGUE"" is acceptable.\n\nWe can also consider ""FORGO"" — no E.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BOGUE"".\n\nThus, the next guess is ""BOGUE"".\n\nBut let me confirm the arrangement:\n\nPattern: P1:B, P2:O, P3:G, P4:U, P5:E.\n\nConstraints:\n- O is not at P3 (here it\'s at P2) → good.\n- G is not at P1 (here it\'s at P3) → good.\n- Letters: B, O, G, U, E → \n  - B: not absent → allowed.\n  - O: present → good.\n  - G: present → good.\n  - U: not absent → allowed.\n  - E: at P5.\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nSo <guess>bogue</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: E is correctly positioned at slot 5 (✓), and C, R, A, N are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 2 (spike)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and S, P, I, K are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 3 (thyme)**: E is confirmed at slot 5 (✓), and T, H, Y, M are absent (x).\n   - **Guess 4 (glove)**:\n     - G is present but not at position 1 (-).\n     - L is absent (x).\n     - O is present but not at position 3 (-).\n     - V is absent (x).\n     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).\n\n2. **Key Conclusions**:\n   - The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n   - **G and O are present** but not in positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n     - G must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n     - O must be in positions 1, 2, or 4.\n   - **New absent letters**: L and V, adding to previous absentees (C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M).

We have feedback from five guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → E is in position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""spike"": S(x), P(x), I(x), K(x), E(✓) → S, P, I, K are absent.
3. ""thyme"": T(x), H(x), Y(x), M(x), E(✓) → T, H, Y, M are absent.
4. ""glove"": G(-), L(x), O(-), V(x), E(✓) → 
   - G is present but not in position 1.
   - L is absent.
   - O is present but not in position 3.
   - V is absent.
   - E is in position 5.
5. ""bogue"": B(x), O(✓), G(-), U(x), E(✓) →
   - B(x): B is absent.
   - O(✓): O is in the correct position (position 2, since ""bogue"" is B-O-G-U-E).
   - G(-): G is present but not in position 3 (of ""bogue"", which is position 3).
   - U(x): U is absent.
   - E(✓): E in position 5 is correct.

So, new information from ""bogue"":
- O is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 2. So the secret word has O as the second letter: _ O _ _ E.
- G is present but not in position 3 (since in ""bogue"" it was at position 3 and got ""-"").
- B and U are absent → add to absent list.
- Also, from ""glove"", we knew G is not at position 1 and O is not at position 3. Now we know O is fixed at position 2.

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ _ E

And we know:
- G is present, but not at position 1 (from glove) and not at position 3 (from bogue). Therefore, G must be at position 4 (since position 2 is O and position 5 is E, so only positions 1, 3, 4 left, but G cannot be at 1 or 3, so must be at 4?).

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5 is E, 2 is O.

G must be in one of 1, 3, 4. But:
- From ""glove"": G not at 1.
- From ""bogue"": G not at 3.

Therefore, G must be at position 4.

So the secret word has G at position 4: _ O _ G E

Now, we need to find the letters at positions 1 and 3.

We also know the absent letters: 
From all feedback: 
C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V, B, U.

So absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V, B, U. (16 letters)

Remaining possible letters: D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z. (and note that G and O are already placed, and E is at end)

But we need two letters for positions 1 and 3, from the remaining: D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Also, we know that the word must be a valid English word.

So the pattern: [D/F/J/Q/W/X/Z] O [D/F/J/Q/W/X/Z] G E

Now, we need to form a word that fits this pattern.

Possible words:

- ""DOGME"" → but M is absent → invalid.
- ""FOGIE"" → I absent → invalid.
- ""JOGUE"" → not a word? 
- ""QOPHE"" → not a word.
- ""WOGUE"" → not common.
- ""XOGUE"" → not a word.
- ""ZOGUE"" → not a word.

What about ""DOZGE""? Not a word.

""DOGE"" is 4 letters.

""DOG"" is 3.

Perhaps ""DOWGE"" → not common.

Another idea: ""FOWGE"" → not a word.

""JOWGE"" → not a word.

""WODGE"" → W O D G E → is this a word? ""wodge"" is a British informal word meaning a lump or chunk.

So ""WODGE"": W(1), O(2), D(3), G(4), E(5).

Check letters: W, O, D, G, E.

- W: not absent → allowed.
- O: at position 2 → correct.
- D: not absent → allowed.
- G: at position 4 → correct (we deduced it must be at 4).
- E: at 5.

And absent letters: D is not in the absent list? Absent are: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K,T,H,Y,M,L,V,B,U. D is not in that list, so allowed.

Similarly, W is allowed.

So ""WODGE"" is a candidate.

Another possibility: ""FODGE"" → F O D G E → but F is allowed? Yes. ""fodge"" might be a word? Or ""fudge"" but that has U which is absent. ""FODGE"" is not common, but ""fodge"" can mean to patch up or mend clumsily.

But ""wodge"" is more common in British English.

Another: ""JODGE"" → not a word.

""WOXEN"" → no E.

So the only common word I can think of is ""WODGE"".

But let me confirm: is there ""DOZGE""? No.

Or ""FOZGE""? No.

""JOWGE""? Not a word.

Therefore, I think ""WODGE"" is the best bet.

So the next guess is ""wodge"".

But note: we have only one guess left? We have 6 guesses total, and this is guess 6? Let's count:

1. crane
2. spike
3. thyme
4. glove
5. bogue
6. wodge (this one)

So we are on the sixth guess.

If ""wodge"" is correct, we win. If not, we lose? But we have to guess.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""DOWLE"" → but L is absent → invalid.

""FOWLE"" → L absent.

""JOWLE"" → L absent.

""WODGE"" seems the only one.

Perhaps ""DOGUE"" but U is absent → invalid.

So I think ""WODGE"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""wodge"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → E(✓) in position 5; C, R, A, N absent.  
- **Guess 2: spike** → E(✓) in position 5; S, P, I, K absent.  
- **Guess 3: thyme** → E(✓) in position 5; T, H, Y, M absent.  
- **Guess 4: glove** → E(✓) in position 5; G present but not position 1; O present but not position 3; L, V absent.  
- **Guess 5: bogue** → E(✓) in position 5; O(✓) in position 2; G present but not position 3; B, U absent.  

### Key Conclusions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ _ E` (O is fixed in position 2, E in position 5).  
2. **G must be in position 4**:  
   - From Guess 4, G is present but not position 1.  
   - From Guess 5, G is present but not position 3.  
   - Positions 2 (O) and 5 (E) are filled, so G must be in position 4.  
   - Thus, the pattern is: `_ O _ G E`.  
3. **Absent letters (16 total)**: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V, B, U.  
4. **Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z.  
5. **Strategy**:  
   - The secret word must be a valid English word matching `_ O _ G E`.  
   - Only 7 letters (D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z) are possible for positions 1 and 3.  
   - Test a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters to maximize solve potential.  

### Why ""WODGE""?
- **Word structure**: W O D G E → `W O D G E`.  
  - Position 1: W (allowed, not absent).  
  - Position 2: O (✓ confirmed).  
  - Position 3: D (allowed, not absent).  
  - Position 4: G (✓ confirmed).  
  - Position 5: E (✓ confirmed).  
- **Validity**: ""Wodge"" is a valid English word (British informal, meaning a lump or chunk).  
- **Efficiency**:  
  - Tests W and D, the most common remaining letters.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on W/D will reveal the solution (only 1-2 options left).  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""FODGE"" (F O D G E) is rare/archaic.  
  - ""JODGE"" or ""QOZGE"" are invalid words.  
  - No other common words fit the pattern and constraints.  

This guess leverages all known constraints and has a high chance of being correct.

   - G(-): G is present but not in position 3 (of ""bogue"", which is position 3).
   - U(x): U is absent.
   - E(✓): E in position 5 is correct.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5 is E, 2 is O.

G must be in one of 1, 3, 4. But:
- From ""glove"": G not at 1.
- From ""bogue"": G not at 3.

Therefore, G must be at position 4.

So the secret word has G at position 4: _ O _ G E

Now, we need to find the letters at positions 1 and 3.

We also know the absent letters: 
From all feedback: 
C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V, B, U.

So absent: C, R, A, N, S, P, I, K, T, H, Y, M, L, V, B, U. (16 letters)

Remaining possible letters: D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z. (and note that G and O are already placed, and E is at end)

But we need two letters for positions 1 and 3, from the remaining: D, F, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Also, we know that the word must be a valid English word.

So the pattern: [D/F/J/Q/W/X/Z] O [D/F/J/Q/W/X/Z] G E

Check letters: W, O, D, G, E.

- W: not absent → allowed.
- O: at position 2 → correct.
- D: not absent → allowed.
- G: at position 4 → correct (we deduced it must be at 4).
- E: at 5.

And absent letters: D is not in the absent list? Absent are: C,R,A,N,S,P,I,K,T,H,Y,M,L,V,B,U. D is not in that list, so allowed.

Similarly, W is allowed.

So ""WODGE"" is a candidate.

Another possibility: ""FODGE"" → F O D G E → but F is allowed? Yes. ""fodge"" might be a word? Or ""fudge"" but that has U which is absent. ""FODGE"" is not common, but ""fodge"" can mean to patch up or mend clumsily.

But ""wodge"" is more common in British English.

Another: ""JODGE"" → not a word.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""DOWLE"" → but L is absent → invalid.

""FOWLE"" → L absent.

""JOWLE"" → L absent.

""WODGE"" seems the only one.

Perhaps ""DOGUE"" but U is absent → invalid.

So I think ""WODGE"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""wodge"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
