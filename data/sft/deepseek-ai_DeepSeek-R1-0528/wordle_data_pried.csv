We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

What we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.
- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.

Next guess strategy:
We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let's try to place E in a new position to test.

Possible positions for E: 
- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
- Position 4: _ R _ E _

We also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don't know about other positions yet.

Moreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.

List of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don't have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.

But note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don't know if there are more vowels.

Top priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.

Idea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.

Some words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.

Examples of words:
- Position 1: E R _ _ _ 
   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.
   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.
   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E's true position.

Another approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.

But also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

Consider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.

Word examples:

Option 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E's? 
Wait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.

Option 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _
   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.

Another: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.

Option 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _
   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn't fit.

What about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word's fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.

So GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.

Looking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _
Examples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.
         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.

What about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.

How about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.

Keep trying: 
_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.

But the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn't end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.

Word: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That's fifth. We don't want E at fifth.

So we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.

How about: 
- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.
- CRUDE? C is forbidden.

Alternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?

Word: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.
ERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.
ERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.

ERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.
But note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.

Also, U and P and T are new letters.

Also, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.

But let's check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.

Similarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it's present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.

This guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.

Another candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E's? But we don't know if word has two E's? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E's? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can't use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn't fit.

We need words with R at second.

Another: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.

Perhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.

How about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.

Place E at third: _ R E _ _

Examples: 
  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.
  FIREW -> not a word.
  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E's? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don't know if secret word has two E's? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn't say only one. So two E's are possible.

But GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.

Another: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.

So back to _ R E _ _ :
  PRIEST? Too long.
  CRESS? C is forbidden.

Another: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E's. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.

How about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.

What about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn't work. Need R at second.

Another: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.

But let's write the positions: 
D at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.

However, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.

Let's compare with other options.

We have ERUPT and DRESS.

Also, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.

Yes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don't include E, then we might miss checking its position?

So in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.

Similarly, ERUPT has E at first.

Other option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.

Another: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.

I think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.

Also, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.

Which position to test? We haven't tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.

But ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.

PRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.

DRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.

All are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.

Which one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.

In ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.
In DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).
In PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.

But R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.

Ergo, we can reuse R? So don't avoid R.

But ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S's? So if the word has an S, we might get information.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has S? It might.

But also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.

Similarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.

But in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.

Similarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.

DRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S's? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.

But S is common? So testing S might be good.

But let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.

Another word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.

BREE? Too short.

Perhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.

I'm deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don't know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.

So why not ERUPT?

Also, note: ERUPT is a valid word.

After this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.

Similarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.

I think both are acceptable. Let's choose ERUPT.

But in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.

So if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it's ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".

But regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".

Therefore, I will go with ERUPT.

But let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.

So guess: ERUPT

But wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That's acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it's in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.

Therefore, let me choose ERUPT.

But we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.

Or FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That's acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?

FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don't know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.

But it doesn't matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.

So reconsider:

Candidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)
Candidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?
Candidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.

How about BRISK? But we don't know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don't include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don't necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don't include E then we haven't gained information about E's position? So I think it's best to include E? Especially since we don't know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? 

Therefore, yes? Include E? 

But FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? 

Another candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? 

But FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? 

FRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.

Compared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? 

So let me go with FRESH? 

But FRESH: E is at third? We will see: 
If the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? 

Also, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? 

Therefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? 

But wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? 

But TRIED has E at fourth? 

Both PRIED and TRIED? 

But FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? 

So FRESH seems best? 

However, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? 

If we guess FRESH? 

Finally: let me choose FRESH? 

But the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? 

Possible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? 

Also, E must be present? Not at fifth? 

Example words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But I'll go with FRESH? 

But we have other constraint? 

Another: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? 

So I think FRESH is a solid choice? 

But let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? 

If secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: 
F: x? Because not in word? 
R: ✓ at second?
E: x? Because BRISK doesn't have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? 

Put: Guess FRESH? 

But the response? 

Actually, we don't know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? 

I think? 

Another word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? 

So FRESH it is? 

Not exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?

But in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? 

But let me see? 

Actually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? 

FRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? 

But I think FRESH is fine? 

Alternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? 

But FRESH avoids duplication? 

So guess: fresh? 

Therefore? 

Conclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? 

So the guessed word: FRESH? 

But in the format: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But wait? We must return the guess? 

But the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? 

But let me double-check? 

First feedback? Secret? Actually, I don't know? 

But logically? So we'll proceed? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? 

So I'll go with FRESH? 

But now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? 

For example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? 

Example: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? 

But SHREW: H at second? R at third? 

Must be: ? R ? ? ? 

Like AROSE? But A forbidden? 
BRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? 

Then? BRIEF? 

And first guess crane: 
C? x
R? ✓
A? x
N? x
E? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? 

Now? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: 

But FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? 

Compared to BRIEF: 
B? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? 

So: 

If secret is BRIEF? 
FRESH: 
position1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? 
position2: R same? ✓ 
position3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? 
position4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? 
position5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? 

So feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) 

That would give R✓ an E-? 

But we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it's present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? 

But anyway? 

Thus, the guess FRESH would be: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But I think it's valid? 

So? 

Final decision? 
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Words like ""fresh"" fit well:
- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).
- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).

Testing E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>fresh</guess>",fresh,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

What we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.
- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.

Next guess strategy:
We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let's try to place E in a new position to test.

Possible positions for E: 
- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
- Position 4: _ R _ E _

We also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don't know about other positions yet.

Moreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.

List of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don't have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.

But note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don't know if there are more vowels.

Top priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.

Idea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.

Some words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.

Examples of words:
- Position 1: E R _ _ _ 
   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.
   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.
   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E's true position.

Another approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.

But also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

Consider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.

Word examples:

Option 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E's? 
Wait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.

Option 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _
   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.

Another: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.

Option 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _
   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn't fit.

What about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word's fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.

So GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.

Looking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _
Examples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.
         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.

What about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.

How about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.

Keep trying: 
_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.

But the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn't end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.

Word: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That's fifth. We don't want E at fifth.

So we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.

How about: 
- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.
- CRUDE? C is forbidden.

Alternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?

Word: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.
ERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.
ERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.

ERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.
But note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.

Also, U and P and T are new letters.

Also, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.

But let's check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.

Similarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it's present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.

This guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.

Another candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E's? But we don't know if word has two E's? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E's? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can't use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn't fit.

We need words with R at second.

Another: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.

Perhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.

How about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.

Place E at third: _ R E _ _

Examples: 
  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.
  FIREW -> not a word.
  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E's? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don't know if secret word has two E's? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn't say only one. So two E's are possible.

But GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.

Another: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.

So back to _ R E _ _ :
  PRIEST? Too long.
  CRESS? C is forbidden.

Another: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E's. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.

How about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.

What about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn't work. Need R at second.

Another: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.

But let's write the positions: 
D at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.

However, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.

Let's compare with other options.

We have ERUPT and DRESS.

Also, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.

Yes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don't include E, then we might miss checking its position?

So in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.

Similarly, ERUPT has E at first.

Other option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.

Another: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.

I think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.

Also, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.

Which position to test? We haven't tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.

But ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.

PRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.

DRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.

All are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.

Which one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.

In ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.
In DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).
In PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.

But R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.

Ergo, we can reuse R? So don't avoid R.

But ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S's? So if the word has an S, we might get information.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has S? It might.

But also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.

Similarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.

But in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.

Similarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.

DRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S's? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.

But S is common? So testing S might be good.

But let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.

Another word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.

BREE? Too short.

Perhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.

I'm deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don't know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.

So why not ERUPT?

Also, note: ERUPT is a valid word.

After this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.

Similarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.

I think both are acceptable. Let's choose ERUPT.

But in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.

So if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it's ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".

But regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".

Therefore, I will go with ERUPT.

But let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.

So guess: ERUPT

But wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That's acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it's in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.

Therefore, let me choose ERUPT.

But we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.

Or FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That's acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?

FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don't know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.

But it doesn't matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.

So reconsider:

Candidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)
Candidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?
Candidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.

How about BRISK? But we don't know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don't include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don't necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don't include E then we haven't gained information about E's position? So I think it's best to include E? Especially since we don't know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? 

Therefore, yes? Include E? 

But FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? 

Another candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? 

But FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? 

FRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.

Compared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? 

So let me go with FRESH? 

But FRESH: E is at third? We will see: 
If the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? 

Also, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? 

Therefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? 

But wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? 

But TRIED has E at fourth? 

Both PRIED and TRIED? 

But FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? 

So FRESH seems best? 

However, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? 

If we guess FRESH? 

Finally: let me choose FRESH? 

But the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? 

Possible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? 

Also, E must be present? Not at fifth? 

Example words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But I'll go with FRESH? 

But we have other constraint? 

Another: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? 

So I think FRESH is a solid choice? 

But let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? 

If secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: 
F: x? Because not in word? 
R: ✓ at second?
E: x? Because BRISK doesn't have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? 

Put: Guess FRESH? 

But the response? 

Actually, we don't know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? 

I think? 

Another word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? 

So FRESH it is? 

Not exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?

But in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? 

But let me see? 

Actually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? 

FRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? 

But I think FRESH is fine? 

Alternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? 

But FRESH avoids duplication? 

So guess: fresh? 

Therefore? 

Conclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? 

So the guessed word: FRESH? 

But in the format: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But wait? We must return the guess? 

But the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? 

But let me double-check? 

First feedback? Secret? Actually, I don't know? 

But logically? So we'll proceed? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? 

So I'll go with FRESH? 

But now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? 

For example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? 

Example: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? 

But SHREW: H at second? R at third? 

Must be: ? R ? ? ? 

Like AROSE? But A forbidden? 
BRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? 

Then? BRIEF? 

And first guess crane: 
C? x
R? ✓
A? x
N? x
E? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? 

Now? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: 

But FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? 

Compared to BRIEF: 
B? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? 

So: 

If secret is BRIEF? 
FRESH: 
position1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? 
position2: R same? ✓ 
position3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? 
position4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? 
position5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? 

So feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) 

That would give R✓ an E-? 

But we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it's present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? 

But anyway? 

Thus, the guess FRESH would be: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But I think it's valid? 

So? 

Final decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Words like ""fresh"" fit well:
- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).
- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).

Testing E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.",Guess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,pried,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

What we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.
- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.

Next guess strategy:
We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let's try to place E in a new position to test.

Possible positions for E: 
- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
- Position 4: _ R _ E _

We also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don't know about other positions yet.

Moreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.

List of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don't have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.

But note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don't know if there are more vowels.

Top priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.

Idea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.

Some words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.

Examples of words:
- Position 1: E R _ _ _ 
   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.
   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.
   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E's true position.

Another approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.

But also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

Consider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.

Word examples:

Option 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E's? 
Wait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.

Option 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _
   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.

Another: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.

Option 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _
   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn't fit.

What about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word's fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.

So GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.

Looking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _
Examples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.
         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.

What about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.

How about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.

Keep trying: 
_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.

But the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn't end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.

Word: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That's fifth. We don't want E at fifth.

So we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.

How about: 
- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.
- CRUDE? C is forbidden.

Alternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?

Word: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.
ERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.
ERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.

ERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.
But note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.

Also, U and P and T are new letters.

Also, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.

But let's check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.

Similarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it's present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.

This guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.

Another candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E's? But we don't know if word has two E's? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E's? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can't use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn't fit.

We need words with R at second.

Another: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.

Perhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.

How about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.

Place E at third: _ R E _ _

Examples: 
  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.
  FIREW -> not a word.
  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E's? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don't know if secret word has two E's? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn't say only one. So two E's are possible.

But GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.

Another: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.

So back to _ R E _ _ :
  PRIEST? Too long.
  CRESS? C is forbidden.

Another: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E's. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.

How about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.

What about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn't work. Need R at second.

Another: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.

But let's write the positions: 
D at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.

However, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.

Let's compare with other options.

We have ERUPT and DRESS.

Also, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.

Yes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don't include E, then we might miss checking its position?

So in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.

Similarly, ERUPT has E at first.

Other option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.

Another: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.

I think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.

Also, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.

Which position to test? We haven't tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.

But ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.

PRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.

DRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.

All are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.

Which one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.

In ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.
In DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).
In PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.

But R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.

Ergo, we can reuse R? So don't avoid R.

But ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S's? So if the word has an S, we might get information.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has S? It might.

But also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.

Similarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.

But in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.

Similarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.

DRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S's? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.

But S is common? So testing S might be good.

But let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.

Another word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.

BREE? Too short.

Perhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.

I'm deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don't know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.

So why not ERUPT?

Also, note: ERUPT is a valid word.

After this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.

Similarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.

I think both are acceptable. Let's choose ERUPT.

But in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.

So if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it's ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".

But regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".

Therefore, I will go with ERUPT.

But let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.

So guess: ERUPT

But wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That's acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it's in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.

Therefore, let me choose ERUPT.

But we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.

Or FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That's acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?

FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don't know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.

But it doesn't matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.

So reconsider:

Candidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)
Candidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?
Candidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.

How about BRISK? But we don't know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don't include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don't necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don't include E then we haven't gained information about E's position? So I think it's best to include E? Especially since we don't know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? 

Therefore, yes? Include E? 

But FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? 

Another candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? 

But FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? 

FRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.

Compared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? 

So let me go with FRESH? 

But FRESH: E is at third? We will see: 
If the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? 

Also, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? 

Therefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? 

But wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? 

But TRIED has E at fourth? 

Both PRIED and TRIED? 

But FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? 

So FRESH seems best? 

However, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? 

If we guess FRESH? 

Finally: let me choose FRESH? 

But the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? 

Possible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? 

Also, E must be present? Not at fifth? 

Example words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But I'll go with FRESH? 

But we have other constraint? 

Another: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? 

So I think FRESH is a solid choice? 

But let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? 

If secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: 
F: x? Because not in word? 
R: ✓ at second?
E: x? Because BRISK doesn't have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? 

Put: Guess FRESH? 

But the response? 

Actually, we don't know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? 

I think? 

Another word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? 

So FRESH it is? 

Not exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?

But in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? 

But let me see? 

Actually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? 

FRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? 

But I think FRESH is fine? 

Alternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? 

But FRESH avoids duplication? 

So guess: fresh? 

Therefore? 

Conclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? 

So the guessed word: FRESH? 

But in the format: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But wait? We must return the guess? 

But the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? 

But let me double-check? 

First feedback? Secret? Actually, I don't know? 

But logically? So we'll proceed? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? 

So I'll go with FRESH? 

But now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? 

For example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? 

Example: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? 

But SHREW: H at second? R at third? 

Must be: ? R ? ? ? 

Like AROSE? But A forbidden? 
BRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? 

Then? BRIEF? 

And first guess crane: 
C? x
R? ✓
A? x
N? x
E? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? 

Now? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: 

But FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? 

Compared to BRIEF: 
B? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? 

So: 

If secret is BRIEF? 
FRESH: 
position1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? 
position2: R same? ✓ 
position3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? 
position4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? 
position5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? 

So feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) 

That would give R✓ an E-? 

But we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it's present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? 

But anyway? 

Thus, the guess FRESH would be: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But I think it's valid? 

So? 

Final decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Words like ""fresh"" fit well:
- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).
- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).

Testing E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.

However, let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\n According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\n I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).\n- C, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nWhat we know:\n- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _\n- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.\n- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.\n\nNext guess strategy:\nWe must choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _\n- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nAlso, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let\'s try to place E in a new position to test.\n\nPossible positions for E: \n- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ R E _ _\n- Position 4: _ R _ E _\n\nWe also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions yet.\n\nMoreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.\n\nList of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don\'t have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.\n\nBut note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don\'t know if there are more vowels.\n\nTop priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.\n\nIdea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.\n\nSome words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.\n\nExamples of words:\n- Position 1: E R _ _ _ \n   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.\n   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.\n   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E\'s true position.\n\nAnother approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\nConsider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.\n\nWord examples:\n\nOption 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E\'s? \nWait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.\n\nOption 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _\n   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.\n\nAnother: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.\n\nOption 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _\n   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWhat about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word\'s fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.\n\nSo GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.\n\nLooking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _\nExamples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.\n         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.\n\nWhat about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nKeep trying: \n_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.\n\nBut the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn\'t end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.\n\nWord: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That\'s fifth. We don\'t want E at fifth.\n\nSo we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.\n\nHow about: \n- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.\n- CRUDE? C is forbidden.\n\nAlternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?\n\nWord: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\nERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.\nERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.\n\nERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.\nBut note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.\n\nAlso, U and P and T are new letters.\n\nAlso, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.\n\nBut let\'s check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.\n\nSimilarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.\n\nThis guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.\n\nAnother candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E\'s? But we don\'t know if word has two E\'s? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E\'s? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can\'t use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need words with R at second.\n\nAnother: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.\n\nPlace E at third: _ R E _ _\n\nExamples: \n  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.\n  FIREW -> not a word.\n  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E\'s? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don\'t know if secret word has two E\'s? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn\'t say only one. So two E\'s are possible.\n\nBut GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.\n\nAnother: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.\n\nSo back to _ R E _ _ :\n  PRIEST? Too long.\n  CRESS? C is forbidden.\n\nAnother: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E\'s. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.\n\nHow about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.\n\nWhat about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn\'t work. Need R at second.\n\nAnother: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.\n\nBut let\'s write the positions: \nD at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.\n\nHowever, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.\n\nLet\'s compare with other options.\n\nWe have ERUPT and DRESS.\n\nAlso, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.\n\nYes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don\'t include E, then we might miss checking its position?\n\nSo in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.\n\nSimilarly, ERUPT has E at first.\n\nOther option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.\n\nAnother: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.\n\nI think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.\n\nAlso, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.\n\nWhich position to test? We haven\'t tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.\n\nBut ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.\n\nPRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.\n\nDRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.\n\nAll are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.\n\nWhich one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.\n\nIn ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.\nIn DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).\nIn PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.\n\nBut R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.\n\nErgo, we can reuse R? So don\'t avoid R.\n\nBut ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S\'s? So if the word has an S, we might get information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has S? It might.\n\nBut also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.\n\nBut in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.\n\nDRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S\'s? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.\n\nBut S is common? So testing S might be good.\n\nBut let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.\n\nAnother word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.\n\nBREE? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.\n\nI\'m deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don\'t know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.\n\nSo why not ERUPT?\n\nAlso, note: ERUPT is a valid word.\n\nAfter this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.\n\nSimilarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let\'s choose ERUPT.\n\nBut in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.\n\nSo if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it\'s ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".\n\nBut regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".\n\nTherefore, I will go with ERUPT.\n\nBut let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ERUPT\n\nBut wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That\'s acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it\'s in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.\n\nTherefore, let me choose ERUPT.\n\nBut we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.\n\nOr FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That\'s acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?\n\nFRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don\'t know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.\n\nBut it doesn\'t matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.\n\nSo reconsider:\n\nCandidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)\nCandidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?\nCandidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.\n\nHow about BRISK? But we don\'t know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don\'t include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don\'t necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don\'t include E then we haven\'t gained information about E\'s position? So I think it\'s best to include E? Especially since we don\'t know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? \n\nTherefore, yes? Include E? \n\nBut FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? \n\nAnother candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? \n\nBut FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? \n\nFRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nCompared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? \n\nSo let me go with FRESH? \n\nBut FRESH: E is at third? We will see: \nIf the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? \n\nAlso, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? \n\nTherefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? \n\nBut wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? \n\nBut TRIED has E at fourth? \n\nBoth PRIED and TRIED? \n\nBut FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? \n\nSo FRESH seems best? \n\nHowever, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? \n\nIf we guess FRESH? \n\nFinally: let me choose FRESH? \n\nBut the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? \n\nPossible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? \n\nAlso, E must be present? Not at fifth? \n\nExample words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut we have other constraint? \n\nAnother: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo I think FRESH is a solid choice? \n\nBut let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? \n\nIf secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: \nF: x? Because not in word? \nR: ✓ at second?\nE: x? Because BRISK doesn\'t have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? \n\nPut: Guess FRESH? \n\nBut the response? \n\nActually, we don\'t know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? \n\nI think? \n\nAnother word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? \n\nSo FRESH it is? \n\nNot exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?\n\nBut in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? \n\nBut let me see? \n\nActually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? \n\nFRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? \n\nBut I think FRESH is fine? \n\nAlternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? \n\nBut FRESH avoids duplication? \n\nSo guess: fresh? \n\nTherefore? \n\nConclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? \n\nSo the guessed word: FRESH? \n\nBut in the format: \n\n<guess>fresh</guess>? \n\nBut wait? We must return the guess? \n\nBut the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? \n\nBut let me double-check? \n\nFirst feedback? Secret? Actually, I don\'t know? \n\nBut logically? So we\'ll proceed? \n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? \n\nSo I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? \n\nFor example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? \n\nExample: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? \n\nBut SHREW: H at second? R at third? \n\nMust be: ?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct position and correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as expected)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we guessed E at position 3 and it was marked wrong position)
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

What we know:
1. The secret word has the letter R in position 2: so the pattern is _ R _ _ _
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but:
   - From guess 1: E is not at position 5.
   - From guess 2: E is not at position 3.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or position 4? 
     Because the positions are: 1,2,3,4,5. And position 2 is R, so E can't be at 2? It could be? But position 2 is R? So actually E cannot be at position 2? Because R is fixed there. So the available positions for E are 1, 3, or 4? But now we have E not at 5 (from guess1) and not at 3 (from guess2). So E must be at position 1 or 4.

3. Absent letters so far: C, A, N, F, S, H. Also, from ""crane"": we know C,A,N are absent; from ""fresh"": F,S,H are absent.

So overall absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H

4. We have two tries left? Actually, we are allowed 6 tries? We have used 2? So 4 remaining? But we proceed step by step.

Strategy for next guess:
- We know E must be at position 1 or 4? So we need to test one of these? But ideally, we can design a word that has E in one of these and also tests other common letters? We might try to rule out possibilities? Also, avoid all absent letters.

Known: secret word has E? and R? And at least one more letter? Because we have only two known letters? We need to find the rest.

We also know that E is not at 3 or 5, so only positions 1 and 4? So we can try to put E at position 1? Then we can see? If E is at position 1? Then it should be marked ✓. Or if the secret word has E at position 4? Then when we put E at 1? It would be marked absent? Or present but wrong? Actually, if the secret word has E? But not at position 1? Then our E at 1 would be marked ""-""? Meaning it is present but not here? And similarly if E were at 4? Then our guess with E at 4 would be ✓.

But note: we are going to make one guess? So we must include E? Because we know E is present? And we don't know its position? But we know the positions excluded.

So the word pattern: _ R _ _ _

And E can only be at 1 or 4? So we have two cases:
Case 1: E at position 1 -> word starts with E: E R _ _ _
Case 2: E at position 4 -> word has pattern _ R _ E _

But also? The secret word must contain exactly? Well, we don't know if E appears once or more? But minimally? It has at least one E? So if E is at position 4? Then the word has E at 4? And no E at other positions? Or it could have another E? But we don't know? We only know from two feedbacks that E is present? And one time placed at 5? Marked as '-', meaning there is E elsewhere? Similarly? Placed at 3? Marked as '-' meaning E is elsewhere? So it could be two E's? Or one E at a different position.

But with the constraints? E must be at 1 or 4? Because we have excluded 3 and 5? And 2 is R? So only 1 and 4 available? So in the next guess? We can try to test both possibilities? Not simultaneously? But we have to pick one.

Alternatively? We can design a guess that tests other letters? But also includes E? Since E must be present? And we need to pin it down? So let's design a word that has E at position 1? And also tests some common letters for positions 3,4,5? Because position 2 is known? So position 1: E (testing if E is at 1)? Position 3: we can put a new letter? Position 4: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And avoid absent letters.

Examples of words that fit:

First? For case E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Word: ERGOT? But has G,O,T? Absent letters? Not? But ERGOT is valid? And avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? So allowed? But ERGOT: E R G O T? So letters E (1), R (2? fixed), G (3), O (4), T (5)? 

But the secret word has E? If E is really at 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Else? '-'? If it's '-'? Then E is not at 1? So must be at position 4? But we are guessing E at 1 to test?

Also? In one guess? We can get information? 

But if we pick ERGOT? And if E is marked ✓? Then we know E is at 1? But also? We get feedback on G,O,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E is at 4? And G,O,T may or may not be in the word? 

But we also can? Instead? Pick a word that tests E at 4? For example? PRONE? But N is absent? Avoid? 

Wait? Must avoid absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

So for E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Common words? ERODE? But D? E R O D E? Two E's? But also O and D? 

But ERGOT? as above? 

How about ERUPT? But U,P,T? 

But ERUPT? From the first? I thought? But now? ERUPT: letters E,R,U,P,T? All? Are these absent? So far? U,P,T are not tested? So they might be present? 

ERUPT? is a valid word? 

But earlier? We considered? Then it was not chosen? 

Another: ENTIA? But N is absent? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? But in the context? 

Perhaps a word that tests E at 1? And includes common letters? 

But common letters? We haven't tested many? The remaining consonants? B,D,G,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels? But vowels: O, I, U, etc? 

So ERGOT? Includes G,O,T? 

But let's see? 

Also? We can test E at 4? 

For E at 4? Pattern: _ R _ E _

Need a word with R in second? E in fourth? And avoid C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Examples: DRYER? But R? repeated? But positionally? Second letter R? fourth E? Fifth R? So D-R-Y-E-R? But R appears? But the secret word might have repeated letters? 

But DRYER? has Y? and it ends with R? 

But the word must be 5 letter? And DRYER? 

Another: BREED? But E at fourth? And at second? but R is at second? So B-R-E-E-D? Has E at third? But we need E at fourth? BREED: positions: B(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)? So third and fourth? But we are putting E at fourth? Also? The word BREED? 

But we want E at fourth? to test? 

Pattern? For secret word? If E is at fourth? We want a guess with E at fourth? 

Word: GRIME? G R I M E? But E at fifth? That's position 5? Which we know E is not at 5? But wait? we are putting E at fifth? That's fine? But in our guess? We want to test E at fourth? So we put E at fourth? 

So words with E at fourth: 

Examples:
  _ R ? E ? 

Avoiding absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Possible words: PRIZE? But then? P R I Z E? But E at fifth? Position 5? 

We want E at fourth? So fourth letter E? Fifth letter not E? 

Like: CROWD? C is forbidden? Avoid? 
BROKE? B R O K E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
TRIPE? T R I P E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
BRIDE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 

How about: DROVE? D R O V E? E at fifth? Avoid? 

ORATE? O R A T E? A is forbidden? Avoid? 

So hard? 

Alternative: WRECK? But W R E C K? C forbidden? 

Perhaps GRAPE? G R A P E? A forbidden? Avoid? 

So: 

A better choice: Use E at position 4? For example? PRUDE? P R U D E? But then E at fifth? 

We need a word with E at fourth letter? 

Example: BARRE? Not a common word? Also? A forbidden? 

Possible: CREEK? C forbidden? Avoid? 

Another: TROVE? T R O V E? E at fifth? 

Let's list words ending with E? But E cannot be at fifth? Because secret has E not at fifth? So words with E at fourth? Are like: ... E ? With fifth letter not E? 

But there are words like: AGILE? But A forbidden? 

Or UTILE? U T I L E? E at fifth? 

But positionally? We have R in second? So the pattern is: ? R ? E ? 

And fifth letter cannot be E? So for E at fourth? Fifth must be a non-E letter? 

So examples? 
- BRUTE: B R U T E? E at fifth? -> not E at fourth? 
- PRONE: P R O N E? E at fifth? Avoid N? 
- CRONE: C forbidden? 

How about: ELOPE? But E L O P E? E at first and fifth? But we are using R? in second? So not? 

Perhaps: PROBE? P R O B E? E at fifth? 

I can't think of common words? 

But then? Why not try E at 1? 

So let's focus on E at 1: E R ? ? ? 

And we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? With 3 new distinct letters? Avoiding absent ones? 

Good words: 
- ERUPT: E R U P T? Avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? 
- ERGOT: E R G O T? 
- ERICK? Not a word? ERASE? But S? And A? forbidden? Avoid? 
- ERODE? E R O D E? Repeated E? But D and O? 

Now? Among ERUPT? ERGOT? ERODE? 

ERUPT: U,P,T 
ERGOT: G,O,T 
ERODE: O,D,E? But E is repeated? 

We already have E? But ERODE? If we guess ERODE? And the secret word has E at first? But also E elsewhere? 

But in feedback? The E at first? If secret has E at first? Marked ✓? Then E at fifth? But the secret word has E not at fifth? From guess1? So secret E is not at five? So our ERODE? We put E at first and fifth? But fifth would be marked? Because secret E not at five? So our fifth E? Should be marked 'x'? If E is not at five? But we know E is in the secret? At a different position? 

To maximize new letters? ERODE has duplicated E? 

So ERUPT? or ERGOT? 

Also? ERGOT contains O? Which is a vowel? And G,T? 

ERUPT? U,P,T? 

But P is common? 

How about EMBER? But M? And R not at second? 

ERUPT seems reasonable? 

And ERGOT too? 

Also? We haven't tested T? 

But T is common? 

So? 

Let me pick ERUPT? 

Then? 

Feedback? 

If E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? 

But also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? 

So? 

Therefore? We guess ERUPT? 

Now? 

But we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? 

So the guess: ERUPT? 

Also? It is a valid word? 

Therefore? 

Step-by-step: 
- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? 
- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? 
- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? 
- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? 
- If E is marked '-'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? 

And since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? 

So? 

We choose ERUPT? 

But what about position 4? 

Another word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? 

Put:

Guess: ERUPT? 

Then feedback? 

Finally? 

In the response? 

<guess>erupt</guess>? 

But wait? 

Alternative? 

We could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? 

Yes?
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane**
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.
- **Guess 2: fresh**
  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)
  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.

### What We Know:
- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).
- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, F, S, H. These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Remaining tries:** 4 attempts left (out of 6).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on narrowing down E's position by placing it at position 1 (if E is at position 1, it will show ✓; else, - would confirm it must be at position 4).
- Test new common letters to gain info on other positions. Avoid absent letters.
- **Selected word: ERUPT** (E at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5). This tests:
  - E at position 1: If ✓, E is at 1; if -, E must be at position 4.
  - U, P, T: New letters not previously tested—feedback will reveal if they are in the word and where.
  - Avoids absent letters (C/A/N/F/S/H) and uses distinct letters for maximum information.

This guess efficiently targets E's position while covering common consonants (P, T) and a vowel (U).

ERUPT seems reasonable? 

And ERGOT too? 

Also? We haven't tested T? 

But T is common? 

So? 

Let me pick ERUPT? 

Then? 

Feedback? 

If E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? 

But also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? 

So? 

Therefore? We guess ERUPT? 

Now? 

But we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? 

So the guess: ERUPT? 

Also? It is a valid word? 

Therefore? 

Step-by-step: 
- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? 
- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? 
- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? 
- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? 
- If E is marked '-'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? 

And since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? 

So? 

We choose ERUPT? 

But what about position 4? 

Another word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? 

Put:

Guess: ERUPT? 

Then feedback? 

Finally? 

In the response? 

<guess>erupt</guess>? 

But wait? 

Alternative? 

We could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? 

Yes?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane**
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.
- **Guess 2: fresh**
  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)
  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.

### What We Know:
- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).
- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, F, S, H. These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Remaining tries:** 4 attempts left (out of 6).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on narrowing down E's position by placing it at position 1 (if E is at position 1, it will show ✓; else, - would confirm it must be at position 4).
- Test new common letters to gain info on other positions. Avoid absent letters.
- **Selected word: ERUPT** (E at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5). This tests:
  - E at position 1: If ✓, E is at 1; if -, E must be at position 4.
  - U, P, T: New letters not previously tested—feedback will reveal if they are in the word and where.
  - Avoids absent letters (C/A/N/F/S/H) and uses distinct letters for maximum information.

This guess efficiently targets E's position while covering common consonants (P, T) and a vowel (U).",Guess 3: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,pried,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

What we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.
- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.

Next guess strategy:
We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let's try to place E in a new position to test.

Possible positions for E: 
- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
- Position 4: _ R _ E _

We also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don't know about other positions yet.

Moreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.

List of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don't have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.

But note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don't know if there are more vowels.

Top priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.

Idea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.

Some words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.

Examples of words:
- Position 1: E R _ _ _ 
   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.
   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.
   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E's true position.

Another approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.

But also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

Consider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.

Word examples:

Option 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E's? 
Wait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.

Option 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _
   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.

Another: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.

Option 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _
   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn't fit.

What about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word's fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.

So GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.

Looking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _
Examples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.
         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.

What about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.

How about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.

Keep trying: 
_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.

But the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn't end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.

Word: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That's fifth. We don't want E at fifth.

So we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.

How about: 
- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.
- CRUDE? C is forbidden.

Alternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?

Word: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.
ERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.
ERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.

ERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.
But note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.

Also, U and P and T are new letters.

Also, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.

But let's check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.

Similarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it's present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.

This guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.

Another candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E's? But we don't know if word has two E's? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E's? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can't use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn't fit.

We need words with R at second.

Another: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.

Perhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.

How about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.

Place E at third: _ R E _ _

Examples: 
  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.
  FIREW -> not a word.
  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E's? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don't know if secret word has two E's? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn't say only one. So two E's are possible.

But GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.

Another: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.

So back to _ R E _ _ :
  PRIEST? Too long.
  CRESS? C is forbidden.

Another: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E's. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.

How about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.

What about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn't work. Need R at second.

Another: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.

But let's write the positions: 
D at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.

However, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.

Let's compare with other options.

We have ERUPT and DRESS.

Also, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.

Yes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don't include E, then we might miss checking its position?

So in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.

Similarly, ERUPT has E at first.

Other option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.

Another: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.

I think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.

Also, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.

Which position to test? We haven't tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.

But ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.

PRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.

DRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.

All are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.

Which one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.

In ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.
In DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).
In PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.

But R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.

Ergo, we can reuse R? So don't avoid R.

But ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S's? So if the word has an S, we might get information.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has S? It might.

But also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.

Similarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.

But in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.

Similarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.

DRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S's? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.

But S is common? So testing S might be good.

But let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.

Another word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.

BREE? Too short.

Perhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.

I'm deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don't know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.

So why not ERUPT?

Also, note: ERUPT is a valid word.

After this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.

Similarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.

I think both are acceptable. Let's choose ERUPT.

But in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.

So if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it's ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".

But regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".

Therefore, I will go with ERUPT.

But let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.

So guess: ERUPT

But wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That's acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it's in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.

Therefore, let me choose ERUPT.

But we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.

Or FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That's acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?

FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don't know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.

But it doesn't matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.

So reconsider:

Candidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)
Candidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?
Candidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.

How about BRISK? But we don't know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don't include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don't necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don't include E then we haven't gained information about E's position? So I think it's best to include E? Especially since we don't know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? 

Therefore, yes? Include E? 

But FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? 

Another candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? 

But FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? 

FRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.

Compared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? 

So let me go with FRESH? 

But FRESH: E is at third? We will see: 
If the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? 

Also, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? 

Therefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? 

But wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? 

But TRIED has E at fourth? 

Both PRIED and TRIED? 

But FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? 

So FRESH seems best? 

However, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? 

If we guess FRESH? 

Finally: let me choose FRESH? 

But the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? 

Possible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? 

Also, E must be present? Not at fifth? 

Example words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But I'll go with FRESH? 

But we have other constraint? 

Another: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? 

So I think FRESH is a solid choice? 

But let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? 

If secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: 
F: x? Because not in word? 
R: ✓ at second?
E: x? Because BRISK doesn't have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? 

Put: Guess FRESH? 

But the response? 

Actually, we don't know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? 

I think? 

Another word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? 

So FRESH it is? 

Not exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?

But in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? 

But let me see? 

Actually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? 

FRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? 

But I think FRESH is fine? 

Alternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? 

But FRESH avoids duplication? 

So guess: fresh? 

Therefore? 

Conclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? 

So the guessed word: FRESH? 

But in the format: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But wait? We must return the guess? 

But the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? 

But let me double-check? 

First feedback? Secret? Actually, I don't know? 

But logically? So we'll proceed? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? 

So I'll go with FRESH? 

But now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? 

For example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? 

Example: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? 

But SHREW: H at second? R at third? 

Must be: ? R ? ? ? 

Like AROSE? But A forbidden? 
BRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? 

Then? BRIEF? 

And first guess crane: 
C? x
R? ✓
A? x
N? x
E? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? 

Now? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: 

But FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? 

Compared to BRIEF: 
B? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? 

So: 

If secret is BRIEF? 
FRESH: 
position1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? 
position2: R same? ✓ 
position3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? 
position4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? 
position5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? 

So feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) 

That would give R✓ an E-? 

But we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it's present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? 

But anyway? 

Thus, the guess FRESH would be: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But I think it's valid? 

So? 

Final decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Words like ""fresh"" fit well:
- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).
- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).

Testing E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>fresh</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct position and correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as expected)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we guessed E at position 3 and it was marked wrong position)
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

What we know:
1. The secret word has the letter R in position 2: so the pattern is _ R _ _ _
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but:
   - From guess 1: E is not at position 5.
   - From guess 2: E is not at position 3.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or position 4? 
     Because the positions are: 1,2,3,4,5. And position 2 is R, so E can't be at 2? It could be? But position 2 is R? So actually E cannot be at position 2? Because R is fixed there. So the available positions for E are 1, 3, or 4? But now we have E not at 5 (from guess1) and not at 3 (from guess2). So E must be at position 1 or 4.

3. Absent letters so far: C, A, N, F, S, H. Also, from ""crane"": we know C,A,N are absent; from ""fresh"": F,S,H are absent.

So overall absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H

4. We have two tries left? Actually, we are allowed 6 tries? We have used 2? So 4 remaining? But we proceed step by step.

Strategy for next guess:
- We know E must be at position 1 or 4? So we need to test one of these? But ideally, we can design a word that has E in one of these and also tests other common letters? We might try to rule out possibilities? Also, avoid all absent letters.

Known: secret word has E? and R? And at least one more letter? Because we have only two known letters? We need to find the rest.

We also know that E is not at 3 or 5, so only positions 1 and 4? So we can try to put E at position 1? Then we can see? If E is at position 1? Then it should be marked ✓. Or if the secret word has E at position 4? Then when we put E at 1? It would be marked absent? Or present but wrong? Actually, if the secret word has E? But not at position 1? Then our E at 1 would be marked ""-""? Meaning it is present but not here? And similarly if E were at 4? Then our guess with E at 4 would be ✓.

But note: we are going to make one guess? So we must include E? Because we know E is present? And we don't know its position? But we know the positions excluded.

So the word pattern: _ R _ _ _

And E can only be at 1 or 4? So we have two cases:
Case 1: E at position 1 -> word starts with E: E R _ _ _
Case 2: E at position 4 -> word has pattern _ R _ E _

But also? The secret word must contain exactly? Well, we don't know if E appears once or more? But minimally? It has at least one E? So if E is at position 4? Then the word has E at 4? And no E at other positions? Or it could have another E? But we don't know? We only know from two feedbacks that E is present? And one time placed at 5? Marked as '-', meaning there is E elsewhere? Similarly? Placed at 3? Marked as '-' meaning E is elsewhere? So it could be two E's? Or one E at a different position.

But with the constraints? E must be at 1 or 4? Because we have excluded 3 and 5? And 2 is R? So only 1 and 4 available? So in the next guess? We can try to test both possibilities? Not simultaneously? But we have to pick one.

Alternatively? We can design a guess that tests other letters? But also includes E? Since E must be present? And we need to pin it down? So let's design a word that has E at position 1? And also tests some common letters for positions 3,4,5? Because position 2 is known? So position 1: E (testing if E is at 1)? Position 3: we can put a new letter? Position 4: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And avoid absent letters.

Examples of words that fit:

First? For case E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Word: ERGOT? But has G,O,T? Absent letters? Not? But ERGOT is valid? And avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? So allowed? But ERGOT: E R G O T? So letters E (1), R (2? fixed), G (3), O (4), T (5)? 

But the secret word has E? If E is really at 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Else? '-'? If it's '-'? Then E is not at 1? So must be at position 4? But we are guessing E at 1 to test?

Also? In one guess? We can get information? 

But if we pick ERGOT? And if E is marked ✓? Then we know E is at 1? But also? We get feedback on G,O,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E is at 4? And G,O,T may or may not be in the word? 

But we also can? Instead? Pick a word that tests E at 4? For example? PRONE? But N is absent? Avoid? 

Wait? Must avoid absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

So for E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Common words? ERODE? But D? E R O D E? Two E's? But also O and D? 

But ERGOT? as above? 

How about ERUPT? But U,P,T? 

But ERUPT? From the first? I thought? But now? ERUPT: letters E,R,U,P,T? All? Are these absent? So far? U,P,T are not tested? So they might be present? 

ERUPT? is a valid word? 

But earlier? We considered? Then it was not chosen? 

Another: ENTIA? But N is absent? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? But in the context? 

Perhaps a word that tests E at 1? And includes common letters? 

But common letters? We haven't tested many? The remaining consonants? B,D,G,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels? But vowels: O, I, U, etc? 

So ERGOT? Includes G,O,T? 

But let's see? 

Also? We can test E at 4? 

For E at 4? Pattern: _ R _ E _

Need a word with R in second? E in fourth? And avoid C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Examples: DRYER? But R? repeated? But positionally? Second letter R? fourth E? Fifth R? So D-R-Y-E-R? But R appears? But the secret word might have repeated letters? 

But DRYER? has Y? and it ends with R? 

But the word must be 5 letter? And DRYER? 

Another: BREED? But E at fourth? And at second? but R is at second? So B-R-E-E-D? Has E at third? But we need E at fourth? BREED: positions: B(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)? So third and fourth? But we are putting E at fourth? Also? The word BREED? 

But we want E at fourth? to test? 

Pattern? For secret word? If E is at fourth? We want a guess with E at fourth? 

Word: GRIME? G R I M E? But E at fifth? That's position 5? Which we know E is not at 5? But wait? we are putting E at fifth? That's fine? But in our guess? We want to test E at fourth? So we put E at fourth? 

So words with E at fourth: 

Examples:
  _ R ? E ? 

Avoiding absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Possible words: PRIZE? But then? P R I Z E? But E at fifth? Position 5? 

We want E at fourth? So fourth letter E? Fifth letter not E? 

Like: CROWD? C is forbidden? Avoid? 
BROKE? B R O K E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
TRIPE? T R I P E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
BRIDE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 

How about: DROVE? D R O V E? E at fifth? Avoid? 

ORATE? O R A T E? A is forbidden? Avoid? 

So hard? 

Alternative: WRECK? But W R E C K? C forbidden? 

Perhaps GRAPE? G R A P E? A forbidden? Avoid? 

So: 

A better choice: Use E at position 4? For example? PRUDE? P R U D E? But then E at fifth? 

We need a word with E at fourth letter? 

Example: BARRE? Not a common word? Also? A forbidden? 

Possible: CREEK? C forbidden? Avoid? 

Another: TROVE? T R O V E? E at fifth? 

Let's list words ending with E? But E cannot be at fifth? Because secret has E not at fifth? So words with E at fourth? Are like: ... E ? With fifth letter not E? 

But there are words like: AGILE? But A forbidden? 

Or UTILE? U T I L E? E at fifth? 

But positionally? We have R in second? So the pattern is: ? R ? E ? 

And fifth letter cannot be E? So for E at fourth? Fifth must be a non-E letter? 

So examples? 
- BRUTE: B R U T E? E at fifth? -> not E at fourth? 
- PRONE: P R O N E? E at fifth? Avoid N? 
- CRONE: C forbidden? 

How about: ELOPE? But E L O P E? E at first and fifth? But we are using R? in second? So not? 

Perhaps: PROBE? P R O B E? E at fifth? 

I can't think of common words? 

But then? Why not try E at 1? 

So let's focus on E at 1: E R ? ? ? 

And we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? With 3 new distinct letters? Avoiding absent ones? 

Good words: 
- ERUPT: E R U P T? Avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? 
- ERGOT: E R G O T? 
- ERICK? Not a word? ERASE? But S? And A? forbidden? Avoid? 
- ERODE? E R O D E? Repeated E? But D and O? 

Now? Among ERUPT? ERGOT? ERODE? 

ERUPT: U,P,T 
ERGOT: G,O,T 
ERODE: O,D,E? But E is repeated? 

We already have E? But ERODE? If we guess ERODE? And the secret word has E at first? But also E elsewhere? 

But in feedback? The E at first? If secret has E at first? Marked ✓? Then E at fifth? But the secret word has E not at fifth? From guess1? So secret E is not at five? So our ERODE? We put E at first and fifth? But fifth would be marked? Because secret E not at five? So our fifth E? Should be marked 'x'? If E is not at five? But we know E is in the secret? At a different position? 

To maximize new letters? ERODE has duplicated E? 

So ERUPT? or ERGOT? 

Also? ERGOT contains O? Which is a vowel? And G,T? 

ERUPT? U,P,T? 

But P is common? 

How about EMBER? But M? And R not at second? 

ERUPT seems reasonable? 

And ERGOT too? 

Also? We haven't tested T? 

But T is common? 

So? 

Let me pick ERUPT? 

Then? 

Feedback? 

If E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? 

But also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? 

So? 

Therefore? We guess ERUPT? 

Now? 

But we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? 

So the guess: ERUPT? 

Also? It is a valid word? 

Therefore? 

Step-by-step: 
- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? 
- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? 
- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? 
- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? 
- If E is marked '-'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? 

And since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? 

So? 

We choose ERUPT? 

But what about position 4? 

Another word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? 

Put:

Guess: ERUPT? 

Then feedback? 

Finally? 

In the response? 

<guess>erupt</guess>? 

But wait? 

Alternative? 

We could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? 

Yes?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane**
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.
- **Guess 2: fresh**
  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)
  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.

### What We Know:
- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).
- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, F, S, H. These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Remaining tries:** 4 attempts left (out of 6).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on narrowing down E's position by placing it at position 1 (if E is at position 1, it will show ✓; else, - would confirm it must be at position 4).
- Test new common letters to gain info on other positions. Avoid absent letters.
- **Selected word: ERUPT** (E at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5). This tests:
  - E at position 1: If ✓, E is at 1; if -, E must be at position 4.
  - U, P, T: New letters not previously tested—feedback will reveal if they are in the word and where.
  - Avoids absent letters (C/A/N/F/S/H) and uses distinct letters for maximum information.

This guess efficiently targets E's position while covering common consonants (P, T) and a vowel (U).

We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions yet.\n\nMoreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.\n\nList of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don\'t have any other vowels known.

We don\'t know if there are more vowels.\n\nTop priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.\n\nIdea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.\n\nSome words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.\n\nExamples of words:\n- Position 1: E R _ _ _ \n   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.\n   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.\n   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E\'s true position.\n\nAnother approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\nConsider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.\n\nWord examples:\n\nOption 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E\'s? \nWait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.\n\nOption 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _\n   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.\n\nAnother: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.\n\nOption 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _\n   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWhat about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word\'s fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.\n\nSo GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.\n\nLooking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _\nExamples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.\n         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.\n\nWhat about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nKeep trying: \n_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.\n\nBut the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn\'t end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.\n\nWord: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That\'s fifth. We don\'t want E at fifth.\n\nSo we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.\n\nHow about: \n- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.\n- CRUDE? C is forbidden.\n\nAlternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?\n\nWord: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\nERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.\nERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.\n\nERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.\nBut note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.\n\nAlso, U and P and T are new letters.\n\nAlso, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.\n\nBut let\'s check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.\n\nSimilarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.\n\nThis guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.\n\nAnother candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E\'s? But we don\'t know if word has two E\'s? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E\'s? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can\'t use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need words with R at second.\n\nAnother: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.\n\nPlace E at third: _ R E _ _\n\nExamples: \n  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.\n  FIREW -> not a word.\n  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E\'s? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don\'t know if secret word has two E\'s? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn\'t say only one. So two E\'s are possible.\n\nBut GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.\n\nAnother: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.\n\nSo back to _ R E _ _ :\n  PRIEST? Too long.\n  CRESS? C is forbidden.\n\nAnother: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E\'s. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.\n\nHow about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.\n\nWhat about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn\'t work. Need R at second.\n\nAnother: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.\n\nBut let\'s write the positions: \nD at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.\n\nHowever, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.\n\nLet\'s compare with other options.\n\nWe have ERUPT and DRESS.\n\nAlso, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.\n\nYes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don\'t include E, then we might miss checking its position?\n\nSo in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.\n\nSimilarly, ERUPT has E at first.\n\nOther option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.\n\nAnother: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.\n\nI think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.\n\nAlso, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.\n\nWhich position to test? We haven\'t tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.\n\nBut ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.\n\nPRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.\n\nDRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.\n\nAll are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.\n\nWhich one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.\n\nIn ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.\nIn DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).\nIn PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.\n\nBut R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.\n\nErgo, we can reuse R? So don\'t avoid R.\n\nBut ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S\'s? So if the word has an S, we might get information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has S? It might.\n\nBut also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.\n\nBut in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.\n\nDRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S\'s? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.\n\nBut S is common? So testing S might be good.\n\nBut let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.\n\nAnother word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.\n\nBREE? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.\n\nI\'m deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don\'t know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.\n\nSo why not ERUPT?\n\nAlso, note: ERUPT is a valid word.\n\nAfter this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.\n\nSimilarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let\'s choose ERUPT.\n\nBut in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.\n\nSo if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it\'s ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".\n\nBut regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".\n\nTherefore, I will go with ERUPT.\n\nBut let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ERUPT\n\nBut wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That\'s acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it\'s in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.\n\nTherefore, let me choose ERUPT.\n\nBut we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.\n\nOr FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That\'s acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?\n\nFRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don\'t know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.\n\nBut it doesn\'t matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.\n\nSo reconsider:\n\nCandidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)\nCandidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?\nCandidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.\n\nHow about BRISK? But we don\'t know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don\'t include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don\'t necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don\'t include E then we haven\'t gained information about E\'s position? So I think it\'s best to include E? Especially since we don\'t know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? \n\nTherefore, yes? Include E? \n\nBut FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? \n\nAnother candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? \n\nBut FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? \n\nFRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nCompared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? \n\nSo let me go with FRESH? \n\nBut FRESH: E is at third? We will see: \nIf the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? \n\nAlso, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? \n\nTherefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? \n\nBut wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? \n\nBut TRIED has E at fourth? \n\nBoth PRIED and TRIED? \n\nBut FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? \n\nSo FRESH seems best? \n\nHowever, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? \n\nIf we guess FRESH? \n\nFinally: let me choose FRESH? \n\nBut the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? \n\nPossible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? \n\nAlso, E must be present? Not at fifth? \n\nExample words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut we have other constraint? \n\nAnother: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo I think FRESH is a solid choice? \n\nBut let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? \n\nIf secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: \nF: x? Because not in word? \nR: ✓ at second?\nE: x? Because BRISK doesn\'t have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? \n\nPut: Guess FRESH? \n\nBut the response? \n\nActually, we don\'t know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? \n\nI think? \n\nAnother word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? \n\nSo FRESH it is? \n\nNot exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?\n\nBut in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? \n\nBut let me see? \n\nActually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? \n\nFRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? \n\nBut I think FRESH is fine? \n\nAlternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? \n\nBut FRESH avoids duplication? \n\nSo guess: fresh? \n\nTherefore? \n\nConclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? \n\nSo the guessed word: FRESH? \n\nBut in the format: \n\n<guess>fresh</guess>? \n\nBut wait? We must return the guess? \n\nBut the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? \n\nBut let me double-check? \n\nFirst feedback? Secret? Actually, I don\'t know? \n\nBut logically? So we\'ll proceed? \n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? \n\nSo I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? \n\nFor example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? \n\nExample: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? \n\nBut SHREW: H at second? R at third? \n\nMust be: ? R ? ? ? \n\nLike AROSE? But A forbidden? \nBRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? \nBRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? \nBRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? \n\nThen? BRIEF? \n\nAnd first guess crane: \nC? x\nR? ✓\nA? x\nN? x\nE? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? \n\nNow? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: \n\nBut FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? \n\nCompared to BRIEF: \nB? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? \n\nSo: \n\nIf secret is BRIEF? \nFRESH: \nposition1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? \nposition2: R same? ✓ \nposition3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? \nposition4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? \nposition5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? \n\nSo feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) \n\nThat would give R✓ an E-? \n\nBut we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it\'s present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? \n\nBut anyway? \n\nThus, the guess FRESH would be: \n\n<guess>fresh</guess>? \n\nBut I think it\'s valid? \n\nSo? \n\nFinal decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:\n- The second letter of the secret word is R.\n- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.\n- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.\n- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid C, A, N.\n\nWords like ""fresh"" fit well:\n- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).\n- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.\n- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).\n\nTesting E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct position and correct (✓) at position 2\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""fresh""\n- F: absent (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as expected)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we guessed E at position 3 and it was marked wrong position)\n- S: absent (x)\n- H: absent (x)\n\nWhat we know:\n1. The secret word has the letter R in position 2: so the pattern is _ R _ _ _\n2. The secret word contains the letter E, but:\n   - From guess 1: E is not at position 5.\n   - From guess 2: E is not at position 3.\n   - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or position 4? \n     Because the positions are: 1,2,3,4,5. And position 2 is R, so E can\'t be at 2? It could be? But position 2 is R? So actually E cannot be at position 2? Because R is fixed there. So the available positions for E are 1, 3, or 4? But now we have E not at 5 (from guess1) and not at 3 (from guess2). So E must be at position 1 or 4.\n\n3. Absent letters so far: C, A, N, F, S, H. Also, from ""crane"": we know C,A,N are absent; from ""fresh"": F,S,H are absent.\n\nSo overall absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H\n\n4. We have two tries left? Actually, we are allowed 6 tries? We have used 2? So 4 remaining? But we proceed step by step.\n\nStrategy for next guess:\n- We know E must be at position 1 or 4? So we need to test one of these? But ideally, we can design a word that has E in one of these and also tests other common letters? We might try to rule out possibilities? Also, avoid all absent letters.\n\nKnown: secret word has E? and R? And at least one more letter? Because we have only two known letters? We need to find the rest.\n\nWe also know that E is not at 3 or 5, so only positions 1 and 4? So we can try to put E at position 1? Then we can see? If E is at position 1? Then it should be marked ✓. Or if the secret word has E at position 4? Then when we put E at 1? It would be marked absent? Or present but wrong? Actually, if the secret word has E? But not at position 1? Then our E at 1 would be marked ""-""? Meaning it is present but not here? And similarly if E were at 4? Then our guess with E at 4 would be ✓.\n\nBut note: we are going to make one guess? So we must include E? Because we know E is present? And we don\'t know its position? But we know the positions excluded.\n\nSo the word pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nAnd E can only be at 1 or 4? So we have two cases:\nCase 1: E at position 1 -> word starts with E: E R _ _ _\nCase 2: E at position 4 -> word has pattern _ R _ E _\n\nBut also? The secret word must contain exactly? Well, we don\'t know if E appears once or more? But minimally? It has at least one E? So if E is at position 4? Then the word has E at 4? And no E at other positions? Or it could have another E? But we don\'t know? We only know from two feedbacks that E is present? And one time placed at 5? Marked as \'-\', meaning there is E elsewhere? Similarly? Placed at 3? Marked as \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? So it could be two E\'s? Or one E at a different position.\n\nBut with the constraints? E must be at 1 or 4? Because we have excluded 3 and 5? And 2 is R? So only 1 and 4 available? So in the next guess? We can try to test both possibilities? Not simultaneously? But we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively? We can design a guess that tests other letters? But also includes E? Since E must be present? And we need to pin it down? So let\'s design a word that has E at position 1? And also tests some common letters for positions 3,4,5? Because position 2 is known? So position 1: E (testing if E is at 1)? Position 3: we can put a new letter? Position 4: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And avoid absent letters.\n\nExamples of words that fit:\n\nFirst? For case E at 1: E R ? ? ?\n\nWord: ERGOT? But has G,O,T? Absent letters? Not? But ERGOT is valid? And avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? So allowed? But ERGOT: E R G O T? So letters E (1), R (2? fixed), G (3), O (4), T (5)? \n\nBut the secret word has E? If E is really at 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Else? \'-\'? If it\'s \'-\'? Then E is not at 1? So must be at position 4? But we are guessing E at 1 to test?\n\nAlso? In one guess? We can get information? \n\nBut if we pick ERGOT? And if E is marked ✓? Then we know E is at 1? But also? We get feedback on G,O,T? \n\nIf E is marked \'-\'? Then we know E is at 4? And G,O,T may or may not be in the word? \n\nBut we also can? Instead? Pick a word that tests E at 4? For example? PRONE? But N is absent? Avoid? \n\nWait? Must avoid absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nSo for E at 1: E R ? ? ?\n\nCommon words? ERODE? But D? E R O D E? Two E\'s? But also O and D? \n\nBut ERGOT? as above? \n\nHow about ERUPT? But U,P,T? \n\nBut ERUPT? From the first? I thought? But now? ERUPT: letters E,R,U,P,T? All? Are these absent? So far? U,P,T are not tested? So they might be present? \n\nERUPT? is a valid word? \n\nBut earlier? We considered? Then it was not chosen? \n\nAnother: ENTIA? But N is absent? Avoid? \n\nSo ERUPT? But in the context? \n\nPerhaps a word that tests E at 1? And includes common letters? \n\nBut common letters? We haven\'t tested many? The remaining consonants? B,D,G,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels? But vowels: O, I, U, etc? \n\nSo ERGOT? Includes G,O,T? \n\nBut let\'s see? \n\nAlso? We can test E at 4? \n\nFor E at 4? Pattern: _ R _ E _\n\nNeed a word with R in second? E in fourth? And avoid C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nExamples: DRYER? But R? repeated? But positionally? Second letter R? fourth E? Fifth R? So D-R-Y-E-R? But R appears? But the secret word might have repeated letters? \n\nBut DRYER? has Y? and it ends with R? \n\nBut the word must be 5 letter? And DRYER? \n\nAnother: BREED? But E at fourth? And at second? but R is at second? So B-R-E-E-D? Has E at third? But we need E at fourth? BREED: positions: B(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)? So third and fourth? But we are putting E at fourth? Also? The word BREED? \n\nBut we want E at fourth? to test? \n\nPattern? For secret word? If E is at fourth? We want a guess with E at fourth? \n\nWord: GRIME? G R I M E? But E at fifth? That\'s position 5? Which we know E is not at 5? But wait? we are putting E at fifth? That\'s fine? But in our guess? We want to test E at fourth? So we put E at fourth? \n\nSo words with E at fourth: \n\nExamples:\n  _ R ? E ? \n\nAvoiding absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nPossible words: PRIZE? But then? P R I Z E? But E at fifth? Position 5? \n\nWe want E at fourth? So fourth letter E? Fifth letter not E? \n\nLike: CROWD? C is forbidden? Avoid? \nBROKE? B R O K E? E at fifth? Avoid? \nTRIPE? T R I P E? E at fifth? Avoid? \nBRIDE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? \n\nHow about: DROVE? D R O V E? E at fifth? Avoid? \n\nORATE? O R A T E? A is forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo hard? \n\nAlternative: WRECK? But W R E C K? C forbidden? \n\nPerhaps GRAPE? G R A P E? A forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo: \n\nA better choice: Use E at position 4? For example? PRUDE? P R U D E? But then E at fifth? \n\nWe need a word with E at fourth letter? \n\nExample: BARRE? Not a common word? Also? A forbidden? \n\nPossible: CREEK? C forbidden? Avoid? \n\nAnother: TROVE? T R O V E? E at fifth? \n\nLet\'s list words ending with E? But E cannot be at fifth? Because secret has E not at fifth? So words with E at fourth? Are like: ... E ? With fifth letter not E? \n\nBut there are words like: AGILE? But A forbidden? \n\nOr UTILE? U T I L E? E at fifth? \n\nBut positionally? We have R in second? So the pattern is: ? R ? E ? \n\nAnd fifth letter cannot be E? So for E at fourth? Fifth must be a non-E letter? \n\nSo examples? \n- BRUTE: B R U T E? E at fifth? -> not E at fourth? \n- PRONE: P R O N E? E at fifth? Avoid N? \n- CRONE: C forbidden? \n\nHow about: ELOPE? But E L O P E? E at first and fifth? But we are using R? in second? So not? \n\nPerhaps: PROBE? P R O B E? E at fifth? \n\nI can\'t think of common words? \n\nBut then? Why not try E at 1? \n\nSo let\'s focus on E at 1: E R ? ? ? \n\nAnd we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? With 3 new distinct letters? Avoiding absent ones? \n\nGood words: \n- ERUPT: E R U P T? Avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? \n- ERGOT: E R G O T? \n- ERICK? Not a word? ERASE? But S? And A? forbidden? Avoid? \n- ERODE? E R O D E? Repeated E? But D and O? \n\nNow? Among ERUPT? ERGOT? ERODE? \n\nERUPT: U,P,T \nERGOT: G,O,T \nERODE: O,D,E? But E is repeated? \n\nWe already have E? But ERODE? If we guess ERODE? And the secret word has E at first? But also E elsewhere? \n\nBut in feedback? The E at first? If secret has E at first? Marked ✓? Then E at fifth? But the secret word has E not at fifth? From guess1? So secret E is not at five? So our ERODE? We put E at first and fifth? But fifth would be marked? Because secret E not at five? So our fifth E? Should be marked \'x\'? If E is not at five? But we know E is in the secret? At a different position? \n\nTo maximize new letters? ERODE has duplicated E? \n\nSo ERUPT? or ERGOT? \n\nAlso? ERGOT contains O? Which is a vowel? And G,T? \n\nERUPT? U,P,T? \n\nBut P is common? \n\nHow about EMBER? But M? And R not at second? \n\nERUPT seems reasonable? \n\nAnd ERGOT too? \n\nAlso? We haven\'t tested T? \n\nBut T is common? \n\nSo? \n\nLet me pick ERUPT? \n\nThen? \n\nFeedback? \n\nIf E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? \n\nIf E is marked \'-\'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? \n\nBut also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? \n\nSo? \n\nTherefore? We guess ERUPT? \n\nNow? \n\nBut we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? \n\nSo the guess: ERUPT? \n\nAlso? It is a valid word? \n\nTherefore? \n\nStep-by-step: \n- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? \n- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? \n- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? \n- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? \n- If E is marked \'-\'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? \n\nAnd since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? \n\nSo? \n\nWe choose ERUPT? \n\nBut what about position 4? \n\nAnother word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? \n\nSo ERUPT? \n\nPut:\n\nGuess: ERUPT? \n\nThen feedback? \n\nFinally? \n\nIn the response? \n\n<guess>erupt</guess>? \n\nBut wait? \n\nAlternative? \n\nWe could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? \n\nYes?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane**\n  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.\n- **Guess 2: fresh**\n  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)\n  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.\n\n### What We Know:\n- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).\n- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""erupt""
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- P: present but wrong position (-) -> so P is in the word, but not at position 4
- T: absent (x)

What we know:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. The letter E is in the word, but not at positions 1, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is R, the only remaining position is 4. Therefore, E must be at position 4.
   - From guess1: E not at 5
   - From guess2: E not at 3
   - From guess3: E not at 1
   - Position 2 is R, so E cannot be there. Thus, E must be at position 4.

3. The letter P is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess3: P at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: in ""erupt"", P was at position 4 and marked as ""-"", meaning P is in the word but not at position 4. So P is present, but must be in a different position.

4. Absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (from all feedbacks: C,A,N from guess1; F,S,H from guess2; U,T from guess3)

5. Present letters: R (at position 2), E (must be at position 4), and P (somewhere, but not at position 4).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _ 
But note: E is at position 4? So the pattern is: _ R _ E ?

But we also have P in the word? And P is not at position 4? So P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the known pattern: position 1: unknown, position 2: R, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: unknown.

And we know P is in the word? But not at position 4? So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Also, we have absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T.

So the available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? And P? But P is present? So we must include P? And the other letters must be from the available set? But we don't know? We have to guess.

But we know the word has at least R, E, P? And two more letters? 

Now, for the next guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2
- Has E at position 4 (since we deduced E must be at 4? But we haven't confirmed? Actually, we deduced it? But we can test? But we are sure? Because all other positions are ruled out? So we can set E at 4? And if it is correct? Then it will be marked ✓? If not? But we think it must be? So we can build on that? 

But to be safe? We can design a word that has E at 4? And P at one of the other positions? And avoid absent letters.

So pattern: ? R ? E ? 

And we know P must be in the word? So we can put P at position 1, 3, or 5? And use common letters for the other positions? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T.

So available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But P is already in the word? So we can use it? 

Now, common letters? We might try to use vowels? But we have E? So perhaps I or O? 

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern: _ R _ E _ 

And contain P? And avoid absent letters.

Examples:
- PRICE? But C is absent? Avoid.
- BRIDE? But D? and E at 5? But we have E at 4? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? But E at 5? Not at 4? So not matching pattern? We need E at 4? So the word must have the fourth letter E? 

So BRIDE? has E at fifth? So not.

- PRONE? But N absent? Avoid.

- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

We need the fourth letter to be E? So the word must end with E? No? Fourth letter E? Then fifth letter is something else? 

So words like: 
  ? R ? E ? 

For example: 
- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- PROTE? Not a word? 
- PRUDE? P-R-U-D-E? But U is absent? Avoid? 
- BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E? U and T absent? Avoid? 
- WRITE? W-R-I-T-E? T absent? Avoid? 

So we need to avoid U and T? 

How about: 
- PRIDE? P-R-I-D-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

We need a word with E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- BARRE? Not a common word? And A absent? 
- CARRE? C absent? 
- DARRE? Not a word? 

Another: 
- PERSE? But P-E-R-S-E? Not matching pattern? We need R at second? 

Pattern: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ? 

So: 
- Position 1: must be a letter? 
- Position 3: must be a letter? 
- Position 5: must be a letter? 

And the word must be English? 

Examples: 
- GRADE? G-R-A-D-E? But A is absent? Avoid? 
- GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? 

I think I'm confused? 

Let me clarify: 
We need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: 
Letter1, R, Letter3, E, Letter5

For example: 
- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4? So not? 

- How about: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E? -> P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> E at 5? 

We need E at position 4? 

So: 
- The fourth letter is E? So the word is: ...X E Y? Where X is letter3, E is at4, Y is letter5? 

For example: 
- ""IRATE"" -> I-R-A-T-E? But A and T absent? 
- ""ORATE"" -> O-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? 
- ""URATE"" -> U absent? 

Another: ""CRWTH""? Not common? 

Perhaps: ""DROVE""? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

I think I need to find words that have E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- ""OGRES""? But 6 letters? 
- ""TRIBE""? T-R-I-B-E? E at fifth? 

Wait, let's search: 
5-letter words with R at second and E at fourth? 

Examples: 
- ARBOR? But A? and E not at fourth? 
- ARDOR? A? 
- ARMOR? A? 
- BROOD? No E? 
- BROOM? No E? 
- CROWD? C? 
- DROVE? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Actually, I found: 
- ""PRESE"" ? Not common? 
- ""TRICE"" ? T and C? absent? 
- ""WRITE"" ? T absent? 

But we have to avoid absent letters? 

Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

Perhaps: ""GRIDE""? G-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

I think I made a mistake? 

But we deduced E must be at position 4? But in English? Are there words with R at second and E at fourth? 

For example: 
- ""PROEM"" ? P-R-O-E-M? But then E is at fourth? Yes! 
  - P(1), R(2), O(3), E(4), M(5) -> pattern matches? 

And ""PROEM"" is a word? Meaning: a prelude? 

Also, it contains P? Which we know is in the word? 

And avoids absent letters? C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T? 

Letters: P, R, O, E, M? 

O and M are new? 

So ""PROEM"" could be a candidate? 

But is it common? But it's valid? 

Another: ""GROPE""? G-R-O-P-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

""PROSE""? P-R-O-S-E? But S is absent? Avoid? 

""PRONE""? P-R-O-N-E? N absent? Avoid? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a possibility? 

But let's confirm the pattern: 
- Position 1: P? 
- Position 2: R (fixed) 
- Position 3: O 
- Position 4: E (as we deduced) 
- Position 5: M 

And P is in the word? But we put P at position 1? And we know P is present? But not at position 4? So if P is at position 1? That's fine? 

Also, if the secret word has P at position 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Or if not? But we know P is present? So if not at 1? Then it would be marked '-'? 

But in this guess? We are also testing O and M? 

Another candidate: ""DROKE""? Not a word? 

Or ""BROME""? B-R-O-M-E? E at fifth? 

But ""PROEM"" is a word? 

We can use it? 

But we have to make sure? 

Another: ""GROVE""? G-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Not. 

""TRODE""? T-R-O-D-E? T absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are better? 

""PRICE"" has C? 

No? 

So we go with ""PROEM""? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have P at position 3 or 5? 

In ""PROEM"", we put P at 1? 

But we could put P at position 3? For example? 

Pattern: ? R P E ? 

But then we need a word: ? R P E ? 

Examples: 
- ""GRAPE""? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- ""GRIPE""? G-R-I-P-E? E at fifth? 
- ""CRIPE""? C absent? 
- ""TRIPE""? T absent? 

Not good? 

Or P at position 5: ? R ? E P 

But then the word ends with P? Like ""CRISP""? But C and S absent? 

Or ""GRASP""? G-R-A-S-P? A and S absent? 

Not good? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""PROEM""? 

But let's write it: 

<guess>proem</guess>? 

But we must be cautious? 

Another word: ""BROME""? But E at fifth? 

No? 

""CREME""? C absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is acceptable? 

We'll use it? 

But note: in ""PROEM"", the E is at position 4? Which we believe is correct? So if it is? Then it will be marked ✓? And we get info on P, O, M? 

If not? But we are confident? 

So? 

Final decision: guess ""PROEM"" 

But let's double-check the deduction: 
- E must be at position 4? Because: 
  - Not at 1 (from erupt: E at1 marked -)
  - Not at 3 (from fresh: E at3 marked -)
  - Not at 5 (from crane: E at5 marked -)
  - And position 2 is R? So only position 4 left? 

Yes? 

So we proceed?

### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 3.  
  - F, S, H are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 1.  
  - P is present but not at position 4.  
  - U, T are absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **R position**: Fixed at position 2. The pattern is `_ R _ _ _`.  
2. **E position**:  
   - E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 (from `erupt`), 3 (from `fresh`), or 5 (from `crane`).  
   - Since position 2 is R, E must be at position 4. **Pattern updated: `_ R _ E _`**.  
3. **P position**:  
   - P is in the word but not at position 4 (from `erupt`).  
   - P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.  
4. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (cannot appear).  
5. **Present letters**: R (pos 2), E (pos 4), P (somewhere).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Target E at position 4**: We are confident E is at position 4, so the guess must include E there.  
- **Test P positions**: Place P at position 1 to test if it belongs there (if not, it must be at 3 or 5).  
- **New letters**: Use common unused letters (e.g., O, M, D, G) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.  
- **Chosen word: PROEM**  
  - Fits the pattern `P R O E M`.  
  - Tests P at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if present but wrong, -).  
  - Tests new letters O (position 3) and M (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

If P is correct at position 1, we confirm the start of the word. If P is misplaced, it must be at position 3 or 5. Feedback on O and M will further narrow possibilities.  

<guess>proem</guess>",proem,"We have feedback from three guesses:

What we know:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. The letter E is in the word, but not at positions 1, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is R, the only remaining position is 4. Therefore, E must be at position 4.
   - From guess1: E not at 5
   - From guess2: E not at 3
   - From guess3: E not at 1
   - Position 2 is R, so E cannot be there. Thus, E must be at position 4.

3. The letter P is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess3: P at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: in ""erupt"", P was at position 4 and marked as ""-"", meaning P is in the word but not at position 4. So P is present, but must be in a different position.

4. Absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (from all feedbacks: C,A,N from guess1; F,S,H from guess2; U,T from guess3)

5. Present letters: R (at position 2), E (must be at position 4), and P (somewhere, but not at position 4).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _ 
But note: E is at position 4? So the pattern is: _ R _ E ?

But we also have P in the word? And P is not at position 4? So P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the known pattern: position 1: unknown, position 2: R, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: unknown.

And we know P is in the word? But not at position 4? So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Also, we have absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T.

So the available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? And P? But P is present? So we must include P? And the other letters must be from the available set? But we don't know? We have to guess.

But we know the word has at least R, E, P? And two more letters?

- BRIDE? But D? and E at 5? But we have E at 4? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? But E at 5? Not at 4? So not matching pattern? We need E at 4? So the word must have the fourth letter E? 

So BRIDE? has E at fifth? So not.

How about:

We need a word with E at the fourth position?

- BARRE? Not a common word? And A absent? 
- CARRE? C absent? 
- DARRE? Not a word? 

Another: 
- PERSE? But P-E-R-S-E? Not matching pattern? We need R at second? 

Pattern: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ? 

So: 
- Position 1: must be a letter? 
- Position 3: must be a letter? 
- Position 5: must be a letter? 

And the word must be English? 

Examples: 
- GRADE? G-R-A-D-E? But A is absent? Avoid? 
- GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? 

I think I'm confused? 

Let me clarify: 
We need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: 
Letter1, R, Letter3, E, Letter5

For example: 
- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4? So not? 

- How about: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E? -> P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> E at 5? 

We need E at position 4? 

So: 
- The fourth letter is E? So the word is: ...X E Y? Where X is letter3, E is at4, Y is letter5? 

For example: 
- ""IRATE"" -> I-R-A-T-E? But A and T absent? 
- ""ORATE"" -> O-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? 
- ""URATE"" -> U absent? 

Another: ""CRWTH""? Not common? 

Perhaps: ""DROVE""? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

I think I need to find words that have E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- ""OGRES""? But 6 letters? 
- ""TRIBE""? T-R-I-B-E? E at fifth? 

Wait, let's search: 
5-letter words with R at second and E at fourth? 

Examples: 
- ARBOR? But A? and E not at fourth? 
- ARDOR? A? 
- ARMOR? A? 
- BROOD? No E? 
- BROOM? No E? 
- CROWD? C? 
- DROVE? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Actually, I found: 
- ""PRESE"" ? Not common? 
- ""TRICE"" ? T and C? absent? 
- ""WRITE"" ? T absent? 

But we have to avoid absent letters? 

Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

Perhaps: ""GRIDE""? G-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

I think I made a mistake? 

But we deduced E must be at position 4? But in English? Are there words with R at second and E at fourth? 

For example: 
- ""PROEM"" ? P-R-O-E-M? But then E is at fourth? Yes! 
  - P(1), R(2), O(3), E(4), M(5) -> pattern matches? 

And ""PROEM"" is a word? Meaning: a prelude? 

Also, it contains P? Which we know is in the word? 

And avoids absent letters? C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T? 

Letters: P, R, O, E, M? 

O and M are new? 

So ""PROEM"" could be a candidate? 

But is it common? But it's valid? 

Another: ""GROPE""? G-R-O-P-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

""PROSE""? P-R-O-S-E? But S is absent? Avoid? 

""PRONE""? P-R-O-N-E? N absent? Avoid? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a possibility? 

But let's confirm the pattern: 
- Position 1: P? 
- Position 2: R (fixed) 
- Position 3: O 
- Position 4: E (as we deduced) 
- Position 5: M 

And P is in the word? But we put P at position 1? And we know P is present? But not at position 4? So if P is at position 1? That's fine? 

Also, if the secret word has P at position 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Or if not? But we know P is present? So if not at 1? Then it would be marked '-'? 

But in this guess? We are also testing O and M? 

Another candidate: ""DROKE""? Not a word? 

Or ""BROME""? B-R-O-M-E? E at fifth? 

But ""PROEM"" is a word? 

We can use it? 

But we have to make sure? 

Another: ""GROVE""? G-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Not. 

""TRODE""? T-R-O-D-E? T absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are better? 

""PRICE"" has C? 

No? 

So we go with ""PROEM""? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have P at position 3 or 5? 

In ""PROEM"", we put P at 1? 

But we could put P at position 3? For example? 

Pattern: ? R P E ? 

But then we need a word: ? R P E ? 

Examples: 
- ""GRAPE""? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- ""GRIPE""? G-R-I-P-E? E at fifth? 
- ""CRIPE""? C absent? 
- ""TRIPE""? T absent? 

Not good? 

Or P at position 5: ? R ? E P 

But then the word ends with P? Like ""CRISP""? But C and S absent? 

Or ""GRASP""? G-R-A-S-P? A and S absent? 

Not good? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""PROEM""? 

But let's write it: 

<guess>proem</guess>? 

But we must be cautious? 

Another word: ""BROME""? But E at fifth? 

No? 

""CREME""? C absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is acceptable? 

We'll use it? 

But note: in ""PROEM"", the E is at position 4? Which we believe is correct? So if it is? Then it will be marked ✓? And we get info on P, O, M? 

If not? But we are confident? 

So? 

Final decision: guess ""PROEM"" 

But let's double-check the deduction: 
- E must be at position 4? Because: 
  - Not at 1 (from erupt: E at1 marked -)
  - Not at 3 (from fresh: E at3 marked -)
  - Not at 5 (from crane: E at5 marked -)
  - And position 2 is R? So only position 4 left? 

Yes? 

So we proceed? 

<guess>proem</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 3.  
  - F, S, H are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 1.  
  - P is present but not at position 4.  
  - U, T are absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **R position**: Fixed at position 2. The pattern is `_ R _ _ _`.  
2. **E position**:  
   - E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 (from `erupt`), 3 (from `fresh`), or 5 (from `crane`).  
   - Since position 2 is R, E must be at position 4. **Pattern updated: `_ R _ E _`**.  
3. **P position**:  
   - P is in the word but not at position 4 (from `erupt`).  
   - P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.  
4. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (cannot appear).  
5. **Present letters**: R (pos 2), E (pos 4), P (somewhere).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Target E at position 4**: We are confident E is at position 4, so the guess must include E there.  
- **Test P positions**: Place P at position 1 to test if it belongs there (if not, it must be at 3 or 5).  
- **New letters**: Use common unused letters (e.g., O, M, D, G) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.  
- **Chosen word: PROEM**  
  - Fits the pattern `P R O E M`.  
  - Tests P at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if present but wrong, -).  
  - Tests new letters O (position 3) and M (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

If P is correct at position 1, we confirm the start of the word. If P is misplaced, it must be at position 3 or 5. Feedback on O and M will further narrow possibilities.",Guess 4: proem -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(x) E(✓) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,pried,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).
- C, A, N are not in the word at all.

What we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.
- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.

Next guess strategy:
We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _
- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Avoids C, A, N.

Also, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let's try to place E in a new position to test.

Possible positions for E: 
- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _
- Position 3: _ R E _ _
- Position 4: _ R _ E _

We also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don't know about other positions yet.

Moreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.

List of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don't have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.

But note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don't know if there are more vowels.

Top priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.

Idea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.

Some words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.

Examples of words:
- Position 1: E R _ _ _ 
   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.
   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.
   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E's true position.

Another approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.

But also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.

Consider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.

Word examples:

Option 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E's? 
Wait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.

Option 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _
   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.

Another: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.

Option 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _
   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn't fit.

What about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.

Therefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word's fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it's present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.

So GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.

Looking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _
Examples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.
         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.

What about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.

How about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.

Keep trying: 
_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.

But the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn't end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.

Word: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That's fifth. We don't want E at fifth.

So we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.

How about: 
- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.
- CRUDE? C is forbidden.

Alternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?

Word: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.
ERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.
ERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.

ERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.
But note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.

Also, U and P and T are new letters.

Also, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.

But let's check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.

Similarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it's present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.

This guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.

Another candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E's? But we don't know if word has two E's? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E's? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can't use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn't fit.

We need words with R at second.

Another: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.

Perhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.

How about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.

Place E at third: _ R E _ _

Examples: 
  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.
  FIREW -> not a word.
  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E's? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don't know if secret word has two E's? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn't say only one. So two E's are possible.

But GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.

Another: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.

So back to _ R E _ _ :
  PRIEST? Too long.
  CRESS? C is forbidden.

Another: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E's. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.

How about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.

What about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn't work. Need R at second.

Another: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.

But let's write the positions: 
D at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.

However, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.

Let's compare with other options.

We have ERUPT and DRESS.

Also, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.

Yes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don't include E, then we might miss checking its position?

So in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.

Similarly, ERUPT has E at first.

Other option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.

Another: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.

I think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.

Also, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.

Which position to test? We haven't tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.

But ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.

PRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.

DRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.

All are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.

Which one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.

In ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.
In DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).
In PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.

But R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.

Ergo, we can reuse R? So don't avoid R.

But ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S's? So if the word has an S, we might get information.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has S? It might.

But also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.

Similarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.

But in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.

Similarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.

DRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S's? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.

But S is common? So testing S might be good.

But let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.

Another word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.

BREE? Too short.

Perhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.

I'm deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.

Alternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don't know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.

So why not ERUPT?

Also, note: ERUPT is a valid word.

After this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.

Similarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.

I think both are acceptable. Let's choose ERUPT.

But in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.

So if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it's ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".

But regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".

Therefore, I will go with ERUPT.

But let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.

So guess: ERUPT

But wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That's acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it's in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.

Therefore, let me choose ERUPT.

But we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.

Or FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That's acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?

FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don't know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.

But it doesn't matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.

So reconsider:

Candidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)
Candidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?
Candidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.

How about BRISK? But we don't know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don't include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don't necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don't include E then we haven't gained information about E's position? So I think it's best to include E? Especially since we don't know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? 

Therefore, yes? Include E? 

But FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? 

Another candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? 

But FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? 

FRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.

Compared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? 

So let me go with FRESH? 

But FRESH: E is at third? We will see: 
If the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? 

Also, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? 

Therefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? 

But wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? 

But TRIED has E at fourth? 

Both PRIED and TRIED? 

But FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? 

So FRESH seems best? 

However, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? 

If we guess FRESH? 

Finally: let me choose FRESH? 

But the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? 

Possible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? 

Also, E must be present? Not at fifth? 

Example words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But I'll go with FRESH? 

But we have other constraint? 

Another: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? 

So I think FRESH is a solid choice? 

But let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? 

If secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: 
F: x? Because not in word? 
R: ✓ at second?
E: x? Because BRISK doesn't have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? 

Therefore, FRESH? 

But now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? 

Put: Guess FRESH? 

But the response? 

Actually, we don't know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? 

I think? 

Another word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? 

So FRESH it is? 

Not exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?

But in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? 

But let me see? 

Actually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? 

FRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? 

But I think FRESH is fine? 

Alternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? 

But FRESH avoids duplication? 

So guess: fresh? 

Therefore? 

Conclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? 

So the guessed word: FRESH? 

But in the format: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But wait? We must return the guess? 

But the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? 

But let me double-check? 

First feedback? Secret? Actually, I don't know? 

But logically? So we'll proceed? 

Also, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? 

So I'll go with FRESH? 

But now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? 

For example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? 

Example: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? 

But SHREW: H at second? R at third? 

Must be: ? R ? ? ? 

Like AROSE? But A forbidden? 
BRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? 
BRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? 

Then? BRIEF? 

And first guess crane: 
C? x
R? ✓
A? x
N? x
E? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? 

Now? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: 

But FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? 

Compared to BRIEF: 
B? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? 

So: 

If secret is BRIEF? 
FRESH: 
position1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? 
position2: R same? ✓ 
position3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? 
position4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? 
position5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? 

So feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) 

That would give R✓ an E-? 

But we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it's present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? 

But anyway? 

Thus, the guess FRESH would be: 

<guess>fresh</guess>? 

But I think it's valid? 

So? 

Final decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.
- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.
- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid C, A, N.

Words like ""fresh"" fit well:
- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).
- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.
- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).

Testing E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.

<guess>fresh</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct position and correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as expected)
- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we guessed E at position 3 and it was marked wrong position)
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

What we know:
1. The secret word has the letter R in position 2: so the pattern is _ R _ _ _
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but:
   - From guess 1: E is not at position 5.
   - From guess 2: E is not at position 3.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or position 4? 
     Because the positions are: 1,2,3,4,5. And position 2 is R, so E can't be at 2? It could be? But position 2 is R? So actually E cannot be at position 2? Because R is fixed there. So the available positions for E are 1, 3, or 4? But now we have E not at 5 (from guess1) and not at 3 (from guess2). So E must be at position 1 or 4.

3. Absent letters so far: C, A, N, F, S, H. Also, from ""crane"": we know C,A,N are absent; from ""fresh"": F,S,H are absent.

So overall absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H

4. We have two tries left? Actually, we are allowed 6 tries? We have used 2? So 4 remaining? But we proceed step by step.

Strategy for next guess:
- We know E must be at position 1 or 4? So we need to test one of these? But ideally, we can design a word that has E in one of these and also tests other common letters? We might try to rule out possibilities? Also, avoid all absent letters.

Known: secret word has E? and R? And at least one more letter? Because we have only two known letters? We need to find the rest.

We also know that E is not at 3 or 5, so only positions 1 and 4? So we can try to put E at position 1? Then we can see? If E is at position 1? Then it should be marked ✓. Or if the secret word has E at position 4? Then when we put E at 1? It would be marked absent? Or present but wrong? Actually, if the secret word has E? But not at position 1? Then our E at 1 would be marked ""-""? Meaning it is present but not here? And similarly if E were at 4? Then our guess with E at 4 would be ✓.

But note: we are going to make one guess? So we must include E? Because we know E is present? And we don't know its position? But we know the positions excluded.

So the word pattern: _ R _ _ _

And E can only be at 1 or 4? So we have two cases:
Case 1: E at position 1 -> word starts with E: E R _ _ _
Case 2: E at position 4 -> word has pattern _ R _ E _

But also? The secret word must contain exactly? Well, we don't know if E appears once or more? But minimally? It has at least one E? So if E is at position 4? Then the word has E at 4? And no E at other positions? Or it could have another E? But we don't know? We only know from two feedbacks that E is present? And one time placed at 5? Marked as '-', meaning there is E elsewhere? Similarly? Placed at 3? Marked as '-' meaning E is elsewhere? So it could be two E's? Or one E at a different position.

But with the constraints? E must be at 1 or 4? Because we have excluded 3 and 5? And 2 is R? So only 1 and 4 available? So in the next guess? We can try to test both possibilities? Not simultaneously? But we have to pick one.

Alternatively? We can design a guess that tests other letters? But also includes E? Since E must be present? And we need to pin it down? So let's design a word that has E at position 1? And also tests some common letters for positions 3,4,5? Because position 2 is known? So position 1: E (testing if E is at 1)? Position 3: we can put a new letter? Position 4: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And avoid absent letters.

Examples of words that fit:

First? For case E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Word: ERGOT? But has G,O,T? Absent letters? Not? But ERGOT is valid? And avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? So allowed? But ERGOT: E R G O T? So letters E (1), R (2? fixed), G (3), O (4), T (5)? 

But the secret word has E? If E is really at 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Else? '-'? If it's '-'? Then E is not at 1? So must be at position 4? But we are guessing E at 1 to test?

Also? In one guess? We can get information? 

But if we pick ERGOT? And if E is marked ✓? Then we know E is at 1? But also? We get feedback on G,O,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E is at 4? And G,O,T may or may not be in the word? 

But we also can? Instead? Pick a word that tests E at 4? For example? PRONE? But N is absent? Avoid? 

Wait? Must avoid absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

So for E at 1: E R ? ? ?

Common words? ERODE? But D? E R O D E? Two E's? But also O and D? 

But ERGOT? as above? 

How about ERUPT? But U,P,T? 

But ERUPT? From the first? I thought? But now? ERUPT: letters E,R,U,P,T? All? Are these absent? So far? U,P,T are not tested? So they might be present? 

ERUPT? is a valid word? 

But earlier? We considered? Then it was not chosen? 

Another: ENTIA? But N is absent? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? But in the context? 

Perhaps a word that tests E at 1? And includes common letters? 

But common letters? We haven't tested many? The remaining consonants? B,D,G,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels? But vowels: O, I, U, etc? 

So ERGOT? Includes G,O,T? 

But let's see? 

Also? We can test E at 4? 

For E at 4? Pattern: _ R _ E _

Need a word with R in second? E in fourth? And avoid C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Examples: DRYER? But R? repeated? But positionally? Second letter R? fourth E? Fifth R? So D-R-Y-E-R? But R appears? But the secret word might have repeated letters? 

But DRYER? has Y? and it ends with R? 

But the word must be 5 letter? And DRYER? 

Another: BREED? But E at fourth? And at second? but R is at second? So B-R-E-E-D? Has E at third? But we need E at fourth? BREED: positions: B(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)? So third and fourth? But we are putting E at fourth? Also? The word BREED? 

But we want E at fourth? to test? 

Pattern? For secret word? If E is at fourth? We want a guess with E at fourth? 

Word: GRIME? G R I M E? But E at fifth? That's position 5? Which we know E is not at 5? But wait? we are putting E at fifth? That's fine? But in our guess? We want to test E at fourth? So we put E at fourth? 

So words with E at fourth: 

Examples:
  _ R ? E ? 

Avoiding absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? 

Possible words: PRIZE? But then? P R I Z E? But E at fifth? Position 5? 

We want E at fourth? So fourth letter E? Fifth letter not E? 

Like: CROWD? C is forbidden? Avoid? 
BROKE? B R O K E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
TRIPE? T R I P E? E at fifth? Avoid? 
BRIDE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? 

How about: DROVE? D R O V E? E at fifth? Avoid? 

ORATE? O R A T E? A is forbidden? Avoid? 

So hard? 

Alternative: WRECK? But W R E C K? C forbidden? 

Perhaps GRAPE? G R A P E? A forbidden? Avoid? 

So: 

A better choice: Use E at position 4? For example? PRUDE? P R U D E? But then E at fifth? 

We need a word with E at fourth letter? 

Example: BARRE? Not a common word? Also? A forbidden? 

Possible: CREEK? C forbidden? Avoid? 

Another: TROVE? T R O V E? E at fifth? 

Let's list words ending with E? But E cannot be at fifth? Because secret has E not at fifth? So words with E at fourth? Are like: ... E ? With fifth letter not E? 

But there are words like: AGILE? But A forbidden? 

Or UTILE? U T I L E? E at fifth? 

But positionally? We have R in second? So the pattern is: ? R ? E ? 

And fifth letter cannot be E? So for E at fourth? Fifth must be a non-E letter? 

So examples? 
- BRUTE: B R U T E? E at fifth? -> not E at fourth? 
- PRONE: P R O N E? E at fifth? Avoid N? 
- CRONE: C forbidden? 

How about: ELOPE? But E L O P E? E at first and fifth? But we are using R? in second? So not? 

Perhaps: PROBE? P R O B E? E at fifth? 

I can't think of common words? 

But then? Why not try E at 1? 

So let's focus on E at 1: E R ? ? ? 

And we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? With 3 new distinct letters? Avoiding absent ones? 

Good words: 
- ERUPT: E R U P T? Avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? 
- ERGOT: E R G O T? 
- ERICK? Not a word? ERASE? But S? And A? forbidden? Avoid? 
- ERODE? E R O D E? Repeated E? But D and O? 

Now? Among ERUPT? ERGOT? ERODE? 

ERUPT: U,P,T 
ERGOT: G,O,T 
ERODE: O,D,E? But E is repeated? 

We already have E? But ERODE? If we guess ERODE? And the secret word has E at first? But also E elsewhere? 

But in feedback? The E at first? If secret has E at first? Marked ✓? Then E at fifth? But the secret word has E not at fifth? From guess1? So secret E is not at five? So our ERODE? We put E at first and fifth? But fifth would be marked? Because secret E not at five? So our fifth E? Should be marked 'x'? If E is not at five? But we know E is in the secret? At a different position? 

To maximize new letters? ERODE has duplicated E? 

So ERUPT? or ERGOT? 

Also? ERGOT contains O? Which is a vowel? And G,T? 

ERUPT? U,P,T? 

But P is common? 

How about EMBER? But M? And R not at second? 

ERUPT seems reasonable? 

And ERGOT too? 

Also? We haven't tested T? 

But T is common? 

So? 

Let me pick ERUPT? 

Then? 

Feedback? 

If E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? 

If E is marked '-'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? 

But also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? 

So? 

Therefore? We guess ERUPT? 

Now? 

But we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? 

So the guess: ERUPT? 

Also? It is a valid word? 

Therefore? 

Step-by-step: 
- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? 
- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? 
- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? 
- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? 
- If E is marked '-'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? 

And since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? 

So? 

We choose ERUPT? 

But what about position 4? 

Another word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? 

So ERUPT? 

Put:

Guess: ERUPT? 

Then feedback? 

Finally? 

In the response? 

<guess>erupt</guess>? 

But wait? 

Alternative? 

We could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? 

Yes?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane**
  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.
- **Guess 2: fresh**
  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)
  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.

### What We Know:
- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).
- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.
- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, F, S, H. These cannot appear in the secret word.
- **Remaining tries:** 4 attempts left (out of 6).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Focus on narrowing down E's position by placing it at position 1 (if E is at position 1, it will show ✓; else, - would confirm it must be at position 4).
- Test new common letters to gain info on other positions. Avoid absent letters.
- **Selected word: ERUPT** (E at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5). This tests:
  - E at position 1: If ✓, E is at 1; if -, E must be at position 4.
  - U, P, T: New letters not previously tested—feedback will reveal if they are in the word and where.
  - Avoids absent letters (C/A/N/F/S/H) and uses distinct letters for maximum information.

This guess efficiently targets E's position while covering common consonants (P, T) and a vowel (U).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)
Guess 3: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""erupt""
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- P: present but wrong position (-) -> so P is in the word, but not at position 4
- T: absent (x)

What we know:
1. The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. The letter E is in the word, but not at positions 1, 3, or 5. Since position 2 is R, the only remaining position is 4. Therefore, E must be at position 4.
   - From guess1: E not at 5
   - From guess2: E not at 3
   - From guess3: E not at 1
   - Position 2 is R, so E cannot be there. Thus, E must be at position 4.

3. The letter P is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess3: P at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: in ""erupt"", P was at position 4 and marked as ""-"", meaning P is in the word but not at position 4. So P is present, but must be in a different position.

4. Absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (from all feedbacks: C,A,N from guess1; F,S,H from guess2; U,T from guess3)

5. Present letters: R (at position 2), E (must be at position 4), and P (somewhere, but not at position 4).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _ 
But note: E is at position 4? So the pattern is: _ R _ E ?

But we also have P in the word? And P is not at position 4? So P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the known pattern: position 1: unknown, position 2: R, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: unknown.

And we know P is in the word? But not at position 4? So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

Also, we have absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T.

So the available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? And P? But P is present? So we must include P? And the other letters must be from the available set? But we don't know? We have to guess.

But we know the word has at least R, E, P? And two more letters? 

Now, for the next guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2
- Has E at position 4 (since we deduced E must be at 4? But we haven't confirmed? Actually, we deduced it? But we can test? But we are sure? Because all other positions are ruled out? So we can set E at 4? And if it is correct? Then it will be marked ✓? If not? But we think it must be? So we can build on that? 

But to be safe? We can design a word that has E at 4? And P at one of the other positions? And avoid absent letters.

So pattern: ? R ? E ? 

And we know P must be in the word? So we can put P at position 1, 3, or 5? And use common letters for the other positions? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T.

So available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But P is already in the word? So we can use it? 

Now, common letters? We might try to use vowels? But we have E? So perhaps I or O? 

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern: _ R _ E _ 

And contain P? And avoid absent letters.

Examples:
- PRICE? But C is absent? Avoid.
- BRIDE? But D? and E at 5? But we have E at 4? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? But E at 5? Not at 4? So not matching pattern? We need E at 4? So the word must have the fourth letter E? 

So BRIDE? has E at fifth? So not.

- PRONE? But N absent? Avoid.

- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

We need the fourth letter to be E? So the word must end with E? No? Fourth letter E? Then fifth letter is something else? 

So words like: 
  ? R ? E ? 

For example: 
- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- PROTE? Not a word? 
- PRUDE? P-R-U-D-E? But U is absent? Avoid? 
- BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E? U and T absent? Avoid? 
- WRITE? W-R-I-T-E? T absent? Avoid? 

So we need to avoid U and T? 

How about: 
- PRIDE? P-R-I-D-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

We need a word with E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- BARRE? Not a common word? And A absent? 
- CARRE? C absent? 
- DARRE? Not a word? 

Another: 
- PERSE? But P-E-R-S-E? Not matching pattern? We need R at second? 

Pattern: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ? 

So: 
- Position 1: must be a letter? 
- Position 3: must be a letter? 
- Position 5: must be a letter? 

And the word must be English? 

Examples: 
- GRADE? G-R-A-D-E? But A is absent? Avoid? 
- GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? 

I think I'm confused? 

Let me clarify: 
We need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: 
Letter1, R, Letter3, E, Letter5

For example: 
- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4? So not? 

- How about: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E? -> P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> E at 5? 

We need E at position 4? 

So: 
- The fourth letter is E? So the word is: ...X E Y? Where X is letter3, E is at4, Y is letter5? 

For example: 
- ""IRATE"" -> I-R-A-T-E? But A and T absent? 
- ""ORATE"" -> O-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? 
- ""URATE"" -> U absent? 

Another: ""CRWTH""? Not common? 

Perhaps: ""DROVE""? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

I think I need to find words that have E at the fourth position? 

For example: 
- ""OGRES""? But 6 letters? 
- ""TRIBE""? T-R-I-B-E? E at fifth? 

Wait, let's search: 
5-letter words with R at second and E at fourth? 

Examples: 
- ARBOR? But A? and E not at fourth? 
- ARDOR? A? 
- ARMOR? A? 
- BROOD? No E? 
- BROOM? No E? 
- CROWD? C? 
- DROVE? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Actually, I found: 
- ""PRESE"" ? Not common? 
- ""TRICE"" ? T and C? absent? 
- ""WRITE"" ? T absent? 

But we have to avoid absent letters? 

Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

Perhaps: ""GRIDE""? G-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? 

I think I made a mistake? 

But we deduced E must be at position 4? But in English? Are there words with R at second and E at fourth? 

For example: 
- ""PROEM"" ? P-R-O-E-M? But then E is at fourth? Yes! 
  - P(1), R(2), O(3), E(4), M(5) -> pattern matches? 

And ""PROEM"" is a word? Meaning: a prelude? 

Also, it contains P? Which we know is in the word? 

And avoids absent letters? C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T? 

Letters: P, R, O, E, M? 

O and M are new? 

So ""PROEM"" could be a candidate? 

But is it common? But it's valid? 

Another: ""GROPE""? G-R-O-P-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? 

""PROSE""? P-R-O-S-E? But S is absent? Avoid? 

""PRONE""? P-R-O-N-E? N absent? Avoid? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a possibility? 

But let's confirm the pattern: 
- Position 1: P? 
- Position 2: R (fixed) 
- Position 3: O 
- Position 4: E (as we deduced) 
- Position 5: M 

And P is in the word? But we put P at position 1? And we know P is present? But not at position 4? So if P is at position 1? That's fine? 

Also, if the secret word has P at position 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Or if not? But we know P is present? So if not at 1? Then it would be marked '-'? 

But in this guess? We are also testing O and M? 

Another candidate: ""DROKE""? Not a word? 

Or ""BROME""? B-R-O-M-E? E at fifth? 

But ""PROEM"" is a word? 

We can use it? 

But we have to make sure? 

Another: ""GROVE""? G-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? 

Not. 

""TRODE""? T-R-O-D-E? T absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there are better? 

""PRICE"" has C? 

No? 

So we go with ""PROEM""? 

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have P at position 3 or 5? 

In ""PROEM"", we put P at 1? 

But we could put P at position 3? For example? 

Pattern: ? R P E ? 

But then we need a word: ? R P E ? 

Examples: 
- ""GRAPE""? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? 
- ""GRIPE""? G-R-I-P-E? E at fifth? 
- ""CRIPE""? C absent? 
- ""TRIPE""? T absent? 

Not good? 

Or P at position 5: ? R ? E P 

But then the word ends with P? Like ""CRISP""? But C and S absent? 

Or ""GRASP""? G-R-A-S-P? A and S absent? 

Not good? 

So ""PROEM"" seems a reasonable choice? 

Therefore, we guess ""PROEM""? 

But let's write it: 

<guess>proem</guess>? 

But we must be cautious? 

Another word: ""BROME""? But E at fifth? 

No? 

""CREME""? C absent? 

So I think ""PROEM"" is acceptable? 

We'll use it? 

But note: in ""PROEM"", the E is at position 4? Which we believe is correct? So if it is? Then it will be marked ✓? And we get info on P, O, M? 

If not? But we are confident? 

So? 

Final decision: guess ""PROEM"" 

But let's double-check the deduction: 
- E must be at position 4? Because: 
  - Not at 1 (from erupt: E at1 marked -)
  - Not at 3 (from fresh: E at3 marked -)
  - Not at 5 (from crane: E at5 marked -)
  - And position 2 is R? So only position 4 left? 

Yes? 

So we proceed? 

<guess>proem</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 3.  
  - F, S, H are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 1.  
  - P is present but not at position 4.  
  - U, T are absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **R position**: Fixed at position 2. The pattern is `_ R _ _ _`.  
2. **E position**:  
   - E is in the word but cannot be at positions 1 (from `erupt`), 3 (from `fresh`), or 5 (from `crane`).  
   - Since position 2 is R, E must be at position 4. **Pattern updated: `_ R _ E _`**.  
3. **P position**:  
   - P is in the word but not at position 4 (from `erupt`).  
   - P must be at position 1, 3, or 5.  
4. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (cannot appear).  
5. **Present letters**: R (pos 2), E (pos 4), P (somewhere).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Target E at position 4**: We are confident E is at position 4, so the guess must include E there.  
- **Test P positions**: Place P at position 1 to test if it belongs there (if not, it must be at 3 or 5).  
- **New letters**: Use common unused letters (e.g., O, M, D, G) to maximize information. Avoid absent letters.  
- **Chosen word: PROEM**  
  - Fits the pattern `P R O E M`.  
  - Tests P at position 1 (if correct, ✓; if present but wrong, -).  
  - Tests new letters O (position 3) and M (position 5).  
  - Avoids all absent letters.  

If P is correct at position 1, we confirm the start of the word. If P is misplaced, it must be at position 3 or 5. Feedback on O and M will further narrow possibilities.

However, let\'s consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\n According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\n I will choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 distinct common letters and includes two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R is correct and in the right position (second letter). So the second letter of the secret word is R.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So there is an E somewhere, but not in the fifth position (since we guessed E at the end).\n- C, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nWhat we know:\n- The secret word has the letter R in the second position: _ R _ _ _\n- The secret word contains an E, but not as the last letter (because if it were in the fifth position, it would have been marked correct). So E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4. However, it could also be in another position, but note we have R in position 2, and E cannot be there.\n- The letters C, A, N are absent from the word.\n\nNext guess strategy:\nWe must choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in the second position: _ R _ _ _\n- Includes the letter E (somewhere except the fifth position? Actually, the feedback says E is present but not in the last position, so we must place E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n\nAlso, we want to maximize information about other letters. We know that E is in the word but not at the end, so let\'s try to place E in a new position to test.\n\nPossible positions for E: \n- Position 1: so word starts with E -> E R _ _ _\n- Position 3: _ R E _ _\n- Position 4: _ R _ E _\n\nWe also have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters. We should avoid repeating C, A, N and also avoid using positions that are already known to be wrong for E? Actually, we don\'t know about other positions yet.\n\nMoreover, we need to rule out other letters. Common letters might be good to include.\n\nList of available vowels: E is already found (though used as vowel?), and we don\'t have any other vowels known. So we might want to include other vowels like O, I, U? But we have E already.\n\nBut note: the secret word has an E somewhere. We don\'t know if there are more vowels.\n\nTop priority: place E and R correctly, and use new letters.\n\nIdea for second guess: Focus on trying E in position 1? Or position 3? We also need to test other letters.\n\nSome words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and contain E (but not at the end) and without C, A, N.\n\nExamples of words:\n- Position 1: E R _ _ _ \n   - Words: ERGOT, EROSE, ERSES, ERNED? But E is in first and we know E is not missing, but ERNED has N (which we know is not in the word). Avoid N.\n   - ERGOT (meaning: a fungus) - uses G, O, T. These are new and common.\n   - But note: the secret word must have E in it and R in second. So if we guess ERGOT, the feedback might reveal E\'s true position.\n\nAnother approach: We know E is present but not at position 5. We can try E in a different position than the first guess had. In the first guess, E was at position 5. So now we can try E at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBut also, we want to use more frequent consonants. Common consonants: T, S, L, etc.\n\nConsider words that have T, S, L along with E and R.\n\nWord examples:\n\nOption 1: Place E at the start -> ERECT? But E at position 1, R at 2, E is repeated? Only one E? But the secret word has at least one E. The repetition might be allowed? But the word ERECT has two E\'s? \nWait, ERECT: E-R-E-C-T. But C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So avoid ERECT.\n\nOption 2: Place E at position 3: _ R E _ _\n   Examples: TRESS?, BRETH? Or more common: TREND? But N is forbidden. BREAK? But K is allowed? But BREAK: B-R-E-A-K. But A is forbidden (from first guess: A is absent). So BREAK has A -> bad.\n\nAnother: WREST? W-R-E-S-T. This avoids A,C,N. And includes W, S, T.\n\nOption 3: Place E at position 4: _ R _ E _\n   Examples: BORED? But that has O, E, D. But BORED: B-O-R-E-D -> R is at third? No we need R at second. So positionally: second letter must be R. So BORED has R at third? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWhat about GROVE? G-R-O-V-E -> R at second, and E at fifth? But the feedback said E cannot be at fifth? Wait, no: the feedback says E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So if we put E at fifth, that is wrong. So GROVE would have E at fifth, which we know is not correct. So avoid E at fifth.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting E at fifth. So _ R _ _ E is invalid? Actually, the secret word\'s fifth letter is not E, because when we guessed E at fifth it gave ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not in that position. So yes, fifth letter is not E.\n\nSo GROVE would be a bad guess because it has E at fifth.\n\nLooking for words with E in position 4: _ R _ E _\nExamples: PRICE -> P-R-I-C-E -> C is forbidden. Avoid.\n         BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E -> U and T are allowed? This avoids C,A,N. And E is at fifth? Wait, BRUTE: positions: B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But we cannot have E at fifth. So invalid.\n\nWhat about BRING? But has N and G? But N is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about FRAME? But has A and M? A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nKeep trying: \n_ R _ E _ (with E at fourth position, and not fifth): We need a word with structure _ R _ E _ and fifth letter not E? But the fifth position is free. E is at fourth? So the word ends with E? No, because fourth letter is E, fifth is something else.\n\nBut the known constraints: second R, fourth E. And doesn\'t end with E? Actually, the constraint from feedback: E is present but not at fifth. So if we put E at fourth that is fine.\n\nWord: TRODE? T-R-O-D-E -> but then E is at fifth? No: T is at 1, R at 2, O at 3, D at 4, E at 5. That\'s fifth. We don\'t want E at fifth.\n\nSo we want E at fourth: and then fifth is not E.\n\nHow about: \n- PRUDE: P-R-U-D-E -> E at fifth? No, same problem.\n- CRUDE? C is forbidden.\n\nAlternative: Place E at first? E R ? ? ?\n\nWord: EARLY? E-A-R-L-Y -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\nERASE? E-R-A-S-E -> A is forbidden.\nERUPT? E-R-U-P-T -> U, P, T. This uses E at first and avoids C,A,N.\n\nERUPT: positions 1: E, 2: R, 3: U, 4: P, 5: T.\nBut note: in our first guess we had E at fifth and now we put E at first. So we are testing a different position.\n\nAlso, U and P and T are new letters.\n\nAlso, the secret word must have an E somewhere. If E is actually at first, then in ERUPT we would have E marked as ✓? Or if the secret word has E elsewhere? But we know E must be present and not at fifth.\n\nBut let\'s check: if the secret word had E at first, then in our guess ERUPT, the E would be ✓.\n\nSimilarly, if E is at third or fourth, then our ERUPT would show E as ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not right position? And also, we have R ✓ again.\n\nThis guess uses E at a new position (first) and tests T at the end.\n\nAnother candidate: EGRET? E-G-R-E-T -> but two E\'s? But we don\'t know if word has two E\'s? Actually, the feedback for first guess: E was marked as ""-"" meaning at least one E, but could be more? Also, EGRET has two E\'s? And G and T. But will EGRET be allowed? We can\'t use because it has E at fifth? Oh wait: EGRET: E (1), G (2), R (3), E (4), T (5). But we need R at position two. In EGRET, R is at three? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need words with R at second.\n\nAnother: EBONY? E-B-O-N-Y -> N is forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But O-R-A-T-E -> A is forbidden. Avoid.\n\nHow about WRITE? W-R-I-T-E -> E is at fifth? Avoid.\n\nPlace E at third: _ R E _ _\n\nExamples: \n  TREND -> T-R-E-N-D -> N is forbidden.\n  FIREW -> not a word.\n  GREET? G-R-E-E-T -> two E\'s? But avoids forbidden letters? And E at third and fourth? But fourth letter E: and we are putting E at third? Actually, GREET: positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:E, 5:T. So E at third and fourth? That could be. But we don\'t know if secret word has two E\'s? It might. But the feedback for first guess: we only have one E marked? Actually, in first guess, we had ""E"" at fifth and marked ""-"", meaning at least one E exists. It doesn\'t say only one. So two E\'s are possible.\n\nBut GREET: avoids A,C,N? Yes. Letters: G, R, E, E, T. But T is common.\n\nAnother: PRESENT? Too long? We need 5 letters.\n\nSo back to _ R E _ _ :\n  PRIEST? Too long.\n  CRESS? C is forbidden.\n\nAnother: FREED? F-R-E-E-D -> two E\'s. Avoids A,C,N. And E at third and fourth? We can use FREED? But is it common? Perhaps not. Better: BREED? B-R-E-E-D -> avoids A,C,N? But we have the E at third and fourth.\n\nHow about PREEN? P-R-E-E-N -> but N is forbidden.\n\nWhat about THREW? T-H-R-E-W -> R is at third? Doesn\'t work. Need R at second.\n\nAnother: DRESS? D-R-E-S-S -> avoids forbidden letters? A,C,N no. And has R in second. And E at third. This seems good.\n\nBut let\'s write the positions: \nD at 1, R at 2 (so R should be ✓), E at 3 (is this the secret E? Or could there be another?), and S at 4 and 5? But S at 4 and 5? It is a word.\n\nHowever, the E in our guess is at third? In the feedback, we know E is present but not at fifth, so having E at third is acceptable.\n\nLet\'s compare with other options.\n\nWe have ERUPT and DRESS.\n\nAlso, another word: TRYST? T-R-Y-S-T -> no E? But we know the word has an E? So we must include E in our guess? Because we know E is in the secret word.\n\nYes! We must include E because it is part of the secret. So if we don\'t include E, then we might miss checking its position?\n\nSo in DRESS: we have E at third. And includes E, which we know is present.\n\nSimilarly, ERUPT has E at first.\n\nOther option: EMBER? E-M-B-E-R -> but R is at fifth? We need R at second. So EMBER has E at first and fifth? And R at fifth? So no.\n\nAnother: ENDOW? E-N-D-O-W -> N forbidden? Avoid.\n\nI think ERUPT and DRESS are candidates.\n\nAlso, consider PRIED? P-R-I-E-D -> E at fourth? and avoids A,C,N? Yes. Structure: P(1), R(2)(✓), I(3), E(4), D(5). And E at fourth? So we test E at fourth.\n\nWhich position to test? We haven\'t tested position 1,3,4 for E? The first guess had E at fifth. So now we can test another position.\n\nBut ERUPT: E at first, R at second, U at third, P at fourth, T at fifth.\n\nPRIED: P at first, R at second, I at third, E at fourth, D at fifth.\n\nDRESS: D at first, R at second, E at third, S at fourth, S at fifth.\n\nAll are valid and include E in a position other than fifth.\n\nWhich one gives the most information? Because we have three unused positions (1,3,4,5) and three untested letters? Actually, the fifth position was only tested with E? And it was absent? But we know fifth letter is not E.\n\nIn ERUPT, the new letters: E (position 1), U, P, T.\nIn DRESS: D, E (position 3), S, S (we get duplicated S? but not necessarily bad).\nIn PRIED: P, R (known), I, E (position 4), D.\n\nBut R is already known to be in second position? So we can reuse it? It will still show as ✓.\n\nErgo, we can reuse R? So don\'t avoid R.\n\nBut ERUPT has U and P which are less common? While S is very common? So DRESS might be better? Also, we test S? But DRESS has two S\'s? So if the word has an S, we might get information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has S? It might.\n\nBut also, we want to avoid wasting letters? Including distinct letters is better? ERUPT has distinct letters: E,R,U,P,T? And R is reused.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P,R,I,E,D -> distinct? P,R,I,E,D are all distinct? Yes? But not: R and E are both known? So we have to reuse known letters? Actually, we should.\n\nBut in ERUPT: letters E, R, U, P, T -> five distinct letters? But E and R are known? Actually E is known to be in the word? And R known? But U,P,T are new? So we test three new letters.\n\nSimilarly, PRIED: P, R, I, E, D -> R and E known? P, I, D are new? Also distinct? Wait, PRIED: letters P,R,I,E,D -> distinct.\n\nDRESS: D,R,E,S,S -> two S\'s? So letters are D,R,E,S. Only four distinct letters? But still valid.\n\nBut S is common? So testing S might be good.\n\nBut let me think: the secret word might have S? Also, DRESS ends with SS? Not common? But not impossible.\n\nAnother word: TRUCE? T-R-U-C-E -> C forbidden? Avoid.\n\nBREE? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ORATE? But A is forbidden.\n\nI\'m deciding to use ERUPT because it tests E at a new position (first), and includes U,P,T which are common? U maybe less than T? But I think it is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we might use a word that tests E in a location we suspect? But we don\'t know. But having E in position 1, we can confirm or deny.\n\nSo why not ERUPT?\n\nAlso, note: ERUPT is a valid word.\n\nAfter this feedback, we can deduce if E is at first or not? And get information on U,P,T.\n\nSimilarly, in DRESS we put E in the middle? It might be equally good.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let\'s choose ERUPT.\n\nBut in ERUPT, we put E at position 1? If the secret word does not have E at first, then the feedback will show E as ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not here? And R as ✓? Then we know E must be at position 3 or 4? Because we ruled out fifth and now we are ruling out first? So we would know E must be at 3 or 4? That would be great? Actually, if the feedback for ERUPT gives E as ""-"", then we know E is not at first? If E is at third, then we might get a ""-"" for E? Actually, the feedback for E: if put at first and the E is really at third? Then it will be marked as ""-"" on the first letter? Correct? Because E is present but not at this position.\n\nSo if we guess ERUPT and E is marked as ""x"" then that means no E? But we know there is an E? So it should not be ""x"", but rather either ""✓"" or ""-"". But given that we know E is in the word? So E cannot be marked ""x""? Because it is present. So actually in the feedback, E will be either ✓ (if at first) or - (if elsewhere? Actually, it\'s ""-"" if it is in the word but wrong position? And here, since the secret word has E? But E is at first? Only if the secret word has E at first it would be ✓, else ""-"".\n\nBut regardless, yes: E will be either ✓ or ""-"".\n\nTherefore, I will go with ERUPT.\n\nBut let me write: we also test U,P,T? And avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ERUPT\n\nBut wait: in the first guess we had E at the end? Now we have E at the start? Using E again? That\'s acceptable? Actually, we can use letters that are already used? Especially E, because it is known to be in the word? Even if we know it\'s in the word, we still need to try different positions? Because the feedback did not reveal the position of E? So we must.\n\nTherefore, let me choose ERUPT.\n\nBut we have an alternative: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E -> but E at fifth? That position is forbidden? Avoid.\n\nOr FRESH? F-R-E-S-H -> E at third? That\'s acceptable? And we have F,S,H? Also distinct letters? Almost: F,R,E,S,H -> distinct? R is reused? But F,S,H are new? This word seems better? Because S is common? And F,H? It does include E? And avoids C,A,N? Also, S is tested? And F and H? How about FRESH?\n\nFRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? And positions: F(1), R(2) must be ✓, E(3), S(4), H(5). But E is at third? So we test E at third? We don\'t know? Also, includes S, which is a common letter? So FRESH might be better than ERUPT? Because U and P are less common? S is more common.\n\nBut it doesn\'t matter? Actually, testing a common letter is more efficient? Because if we find S is in the word? That would be very helpful.\n\nSo reconsider:\n\nCandidate 1: ERUPT - E at 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5. New letters: U,P,T (all consonants? less common)\nCandidate 2: FRESH - F at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, H at 5. New letters: F,S,H. F is common? Maybe not the most? S is common? H is common?\nCandidate 3: DRESS - D at 1, R at 2, E at 3, S at 4, S at 5? So it tests D and S? And E? But duplicated S.\n\nHow about BRISK? But we don\'t know if it has B,I,S,K? But it has R? And E? BRISK: B-R-I-S-K -> no E? Oh! But we know the secret word must contain E? So if we don\'t include E? Then we are breaking rule? We must include E? Because it is known to be in the word? So all guesses must include E? Until we know its position? Actually, no? We can guess without E? But then we lose information about E? But the feedback will tell us that? Actually, the feedback will mark E as ""x"" if absent? But we know E is in the word? So we don\'t necessarily have to include E? We can use a guess without E to test other letters? But that might be not efficient? But possible? However, since we know E is present, if we don\'t include E then we haven\'t gained information about E\'s position? So I think it\'s best to include E? Especially since we don\'t know its position? So probably we should include E in the next guess? To pin it down? \n\nTherefore, yes? Include E? \n\nBut FRESH includes E? So let me pick FRESH? Because it tests E at a different position (third), and includes common letters: F? F is not the most common? But S is common? \n\nAnother candidate: PRESS? P-R-E-S-S -> has E? But duplicated S? \n\nBut FRESH: letters F,R,E,S,H? Distinct!? Yes: all distinct? Unlike DRESS? \n\nFRESH: distinct letters? F,R,E,S,H? And five letters: F,R,E,S,H? So distinct? Actually, FRESH is distinct? Also, common words? FRESH is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nCompared to ERUPT? ERUPT has U and P? U is less common than S? So FRESH might be better? Because it tests a more common letter S? \n\nSo let me go with FRESH? \n\nBut FRESH: E is at third? We will see: \nIf the secret word has E at third? Then ✓ for E? Else, E will be ""-""? Meaning E is elsewhere? \n\nAlso, we test F? S? H? So it uses three new letters? \n\nTherefore, I decide to guess: FRESH? \n\nBut wait? What about PRIED? P-R-I-E-D? Which tests P,R,I,E,D? And E at fourth? That also distinct? Another possibility: TRIED? T-R-I-E-D -> same? T,R,I,E,D? Distinct? \n\nBut TRIED has E at fourth? \n\nBoth PRIED and TRIED? \n\nBut FRESH includes S? Which is top 5 common letter? So S might be better than I? Or D? \n\nSo FRESH seems best? \n\nHowever, we know: the fifth letter? We have not tested? So in FRESH we test H at fifth? \n\nIf we guess FRESH? \n\nFinally: let me choose FRESH? \n\nBut the secret word? For example? The first word was crane: feedback C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) -> so secret word? For instance, what could it be? \n\nPossible words? Like BRICK? But R must be second? Letter E present? And no C? No A? No N? \n\nAlso, E must be present? Not at fifth? \n\nExample words: PRIZE, BRINE? but N forbidden? BRIDE? E at fifth? But forbidden? So cannot be BRIDE. Because we know E is not fifth? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? so invalid. \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut we have other constraint? \n\nAnother: CROWD? But C forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo I think FRESH is a solid choice? \n\nBut let me confirm? Feedback? After FRESH? \n\nIf secret word is BRISK? Then FRESH: \nF: x? Because not in word? \nR: ✓ at second?\nE: x? Because BRISK doesn\'t have E? Wait no? But we know that secret word has E? Because first feedback? So any secret word? Must have E? So BRISK cannot be? \n\nTherefore, FRESH? \n\nBut now? We have R in second? Known? E in third? We are testing? \n\nPut: Guess FRESH? \n\nBut the response? \n\nActually, we don\'t know the secret word? So we pick FRESH? \n\nI think? \n\nAnother word? Perhaps BORED? But B-O-R-E-D? R at third? Not second? So no? \n\nSo FRESH it is? \n\nNot exactly? Our guess must be FRESH?\n\nBut in FRESH? We have letters: F, R, E, S, H? \n\nBut let me see? \n\nActually, ERUPT? has T? Which is very common? \n\nFRESH? has T not? But has S? Which is also common? \n\nBut I think FRESH is fine? \n\nAlternatively? TRESS? T-R-E-S-S? Has duplicated S? But T? \n\nBut FRESH avoids duplication? \n\nSo guess: fresh? \n\nTherefore? \n\nConclusion: For the second guess, choosing FRESH? to put E in the third position and test common letters? \n\nSo the guessed word: FRESH? \n\nBut in the format: \n\n<guess>fresh</guess>? \n\nBut wait? We must return the guess? \n\nBut the instruction: respond with <guess> word </guess>? \n\nBut let me double-check? \n\nFirst feedback? Secret? Actually, I don\'t know? \n\nBut logically? So we\'ll proceed? \n\nAlso, the word must be 5 letters? FRESH? Yes? \n\nSo I\'ll go with FRESH? \n\nBut now I think: in the first guess, the secret word? \n\nFor example: with R at second? And E present? Not at fifth? And no C,A,N? \n\nExample: SHREW? S-H-R-E-W? -> R at third? So no? Because R must be at second? \n\nBut SHREW: H at second? R at third? \n\nMust be: ? R ? ? ? \n\nLike AROSE? But A forbidden? \nBRUTE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? \nBRIDE? E at fifth? Forbidden? \nBRIEF? B-R-I-E-F? E at fourth? So possible? \n\nThen? BRIEF? \n\nAnd first guess crane: \nC? x\nR? ✓\nA? x\nN? x\nE? at fifth? but in BRIEF? E is at fourth? So E present? but fifth is not E? So feedback for E: -? Correct? \n\nNow? Second guess? Freshen? We guess FRESH: \n\nBut FRESH: letters F-R-E-S-H? \n\nCompared to BRIEF: \nB? not in FRESH? But secret BRIEF has B? and I? \n\nSo: \n\nIf secret is BRIEF? \nFRESH: \nposition1: F vs B? F not in secret? So x? \nposition2: R same? ✓ \nposition3: E vs I? But BRIEF? has E at fourth? So E is present? but at third? no? So E in FRESH at third? but secret at fourth? So feedback for E: would be -? \nposition4: S? BRIEF? has F at fifth? no? Fourth letter? BRIEF: E at fourth? So S is compared to E? Not E? So S not in word? so x? \nposition5: H? BRIEF has F? So H? not in? So x? \n\nSo feedback? F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) \n\nThat would give R✓ an E-? \n\nBut we would know E? is at fourth? because E- means it\'s present and in wrong position? and at third? so not? Then it must be at another position? Which could be fourth? \n\nBut anyway? \n\nThus, the guess FRESH would be: \n\n<guess>fresh</guess>? \n\nBut I think it\'s valid? \n\nSo? \n\nFinal decision?Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not in word, R correct position, A not in word, N not in word, E present but wrong position), we know:\n- The second letter of the secret word is R.\n- The secret word contains E but not in the fifth position.\n- Letters C, A, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must have R in the second position to maintain the known correct placement.\n- Must include E to narrow down its position (not in fifth, so try a new position like third) and confirm its presence.\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid C, A, N.\n\nWords like ""fresh"" fit well:\n- Starts with F (new), R (second, correct), E (third, testing new position), S (common letter), H (new).\n- All 5 distinct letters except R and E (known), focusing on new consonants like S, which is frequent.\n- Avoids forbidden letters and positions E correctly in a previously untested spot (third).\n\nTesting E at third (was fifth before) will help pinpoint its location. Feedback on F, S, and H will also reveal their presence/absence.\n\n<guess>fresh</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct position and correct (✓) at position 2\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""fresh""\n- F: absent (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as expected)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) ... so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we guessed E at position 3 and it was marked wrong position)\n- S: absent (x)\n- H: absent (x)\n\nWhat we know:\n1. The secret word has the letter R in position 2: so the pattern is _ R _ _ _\n2. The secret word contains the letter E, but:\n   - From guess 1: E is not at position 5.\n   - From guess 2: E is not at position 3.\n   - Therefore, E must be in position 1 or position 4? \n     Because the positions are: 1,2,3,4,5. And position 2 is R, so E can\'t be at 2? It could be? But position 2 is R? So actually E cannot be at position 2? Because R is fixed there. So the available positions for E are 1, 3, or 4? But now we have E not at 5 (from guess1) and not at 3 (from guess2). So E must be at position 1 or 4.\n\n3. Absent letters so far: C, A, N, F, S, H. Also, from ""crane"": we know C,A,N are absent; from ""fresh"": F,S,H are absent.\n\nSo overall absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H\n\n4. We have two tries left? Actually, we are allowed 6 tries? We have used 2? So 4 remaining? But we proceed step by step.\n\nStrategy for next guess:\n- We know E must be at position 1 or 4? So we need to test one of these? But ideally, we can design a word that has E in one of these and also tests other common letters? We might try to rule out possibilities? Also, avoid all absent letters.\n\nKnown: secret word has E? and R? And at least one more letter? Because we have only two known letters? We need to find the rest.\n\nWe also know that E is not at 3 or 5, so only positions 1 and 4? So we can try to put E at position 1? Then we can see? If E is at position 1? Then it should be marked ✓. Or if the secret word has E at position 4? Then when we put E at 1? It would be marked absent? Or present but wrong? Actually, if the secret word has E? But not at position 1? Then our E at 1 would be marked ""-""? Meaning it is present but not here? And similarly if E were at 4? Then our guess with E at 4 would be ✓.\n\nBut note: we are going to make one guess? So we must include E? Because we know E is present? And we don\'t know its position? But we know the positions excluded.\n\nSo the word pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nAnd E can only be at 1 or 4? So we have two cases:\nCase 1: E at position 1 -> word starts with E: E R _ _ _\nCase 2: E at position 4 -> word has pattern _ R _ E _\n\nBut also? The secret word must contain exactly? Well, we don\'t know if E appears once or more? But minimally? It has at least one E? So if E is at position 4? Then the word has E at 4? And no E at other positions? Or it could have another E? But we don\'t know? We only know from two feedbacks that E is present? And one time placed at 5? Marked as \'-\', meaning there is E elsewhere? Similarly? Placed at 3? Marked as \'-\' meaning E is elsewhere? So it could be two E\'s? Or one E at a different position.\n\nBut with the constraints? E must be at 1 or 4? Because we have excluded 3 and 5? And 2 is R? So only 1 and 4 available? So in the next guess? We can try to test both possibilities? Not simultaneously? But we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively? We can design a guess that tests other letters? But also includes E? Since E must be present? And we need to pin it down? So let\'s design a word that has E at position 1? And also tests some common letters for positions 3,4,5? Because position 2 is known? So position 1: E (testing if E is at 1)? Position 3: we can put a new letter? Position 4: new letter? Position 5: new letter? And avoid absent letters.\n\nExamples of words that fit:\n\nFirst? For case E at 1: E R ? ? ?\n\nWord: ERGOT? But has G,O,T? Absent letters? Not? But ERGOT is valid? And avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? So allowed? But ERGOT: E R G O T? So letters E (1), R (2? fixed), G (3), O (4), T (5)? \n\nBut the secret word has E? If E is really at 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Else? \'-\'? If it\'s \'-\'? Then E is not at 1? So must be at position 4? But we are guessing E at 1 to test?\n\nAlso? In one guess? We can get information? \n\nBut if we pick ERGOT? And if E is marked ✓? Then we know E is at 1? But also? We get feedback on G,O,T? \n\nIf E is marked \'-\'? Then we know E is at 4? And G,O,T may or may not be in the word? \n\nBut we also can? Instead? Pick a word that tests E at 4? For example? PRONE? But N is absent? Avoid? \n\nWait? Must avoid absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nSo for E at 1: E R ? ? ?\n\nCommon words? ERODE? But D? E R O D E? Two E\'s? But also O and D? \n\nBut ERGOT? as above? \n\nHow about ERUPT? But U,P,T? \n\nBut ERUPT? From the first? I thought? But now? ERUPT: letters E,R,U,P,T? All? Are these absent? So far? U,P,T are not tested? So they might be present? \n\nERUPT? is a valid word? \n\nBut earlier? We considered? Then it was not chosen? \n\nAnother: ENTIA? But N is absent? Avoid? \n\nSo ERUPT? But in the context? \n\nPerhaps a word that tests E at 1? And includes common letters? \n\nBut common letters? We haven\'t tested many? The remaining consonants? B,D,G,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And vowels? But vowels: O, I, U, etc? \n\nSo ERGOT? Includes G,O,T? \n\nBut let\'s see? \n\nAlso? We can test E at 4? \n\nFor E at 4? Pattern: _ R _ E _\n\nNeed a word with R in second? E in fourth? And avoid C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nExamples: DRYER? But R? repeated? But positionally? Second letter R? fourth E? Fifth R? So D-R-Y-E-R? But R appears? But the secret word might have repeated letters? \n\nBut DRYER? has Y? and it ends with R? \n\nBut the word must be 5 letter? And DRYER? \n\nAnother: BREED? But E at fourth? And at second? but R is at second? So B-R-E-E-D? Has E at third? But we need E at fourth? BREED: positions: B(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)? So third and fourth? But we are putting E at fourth? Also? The word BREED? \n\nBut we want E at fourth? to test? \n\nPattern? For secret word? If E is at fourth? We want a guess with E at fourth? \n\nWord: GRIME? G R I M E? But E at fifth? That\'s position 5? Which we know E is not at 5? But wait? we are putting E at fifth? That\'s fine? But in our guess? We want to test E at fourth? So we put E at fourth? \n\nSo words with E at fourth: \n\nExamples:\n  _ R ? E ? \n\nAvoiding absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H? \n\nPossible words: PRIZE? But then? P R I Z E? But E at fifth? Position 5? \n\nWe want E at fourth? So fourth letter E? Fifth letter not E? \n\nLike: CROWD? C is forbidden? Avoid? \nBROKE? B R O K E? E at fifth? Avoid? \nTRIPE? T R I P E? E at fifth? Avoid? \nBRIDE? But E at fifth? Forbidden? \n\nHow about: DROVE? D R O V E? E at fifth? Avoid? \n\nORATE? O R A T E? A is forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo hard? \n\nAlternative: WRECK? But W R E C K? C forbidden? \n\nPerhaps GRAPE? G R A P E? A forbidden? Avoid? \n\nSo: \n\nA better choice: Use E at position 4? For example? PRUDE? P R U D E? But then E at fifth? \n\nWe need a word with E at fourth letter? \n\nExample: BARRE? Not a common word? Also? A forbidden? \n\nPossible: CREEK? C forbidden? Avoid? \n\nAnother: TROVE? T R O V E? E at fifth? \n\nLet\'s list words ending with E? But E cannot be at fifth? Because secret has E not at fifth? So words with E at fourth? Are like: ... E ? With fifth letter not E? \n\nBut there are words like: AGILE? But A forbidden? \n\nOr UTILE? U T I L E? E at fifth? \n\nBut positionally? We have R in second? So the pattern is: ? R ? E ? \n\nAnd fifth letter cannot be E? So for E at fourth? Fifth must be a non-E letter? \n\nSo examples? \n- BRUTE: B R U T E? E at fifth? -> not E at fourth? \n- PRONE: P R O N E? E at fifth? Avoid N? \n- CRONE: C forbidden? \n\nHow about: ELOPE? But E L O P E? E at first and fifth? But we are using R? in second? So not? \n\nPerhaps: PROBE? P R O B E? E at fifth? \n\nI can\'t think of common words? \n\nBut then? Why not try E at 1? \n\nSo let\'s focus on E at 1: E R ? ? ? \n\nAnd we have positions 3,4,5 to fill? With 3 new distinct letters? Avoiding absent ones? \n\nGood words: \n- ERUPT: E R U P T? Avoids C,A,N,F,S,H? \n- ERGOT: E R G O T? \n- ERICK? Not a word? ERASE? But S? And A? forbidden? Avoid? \n- ERODE? E R O D E? Repeated E? But D and O? \n\nNow? Among ERUPT? ERGOT? ERODE? \n\nERUPT: U,P,T \nERGOT: G,O,T \nERODE: O,D,E? But E is repeated? \n\nWe already have E? But ERODE? If we guess ERODE? And the secret word has E at first? But also E elsewhere? \n\nBut in feedback? The E at first? If secret has E at first? Marked ✓? Then E at fifth? But the secret word has E not at fifth? From guess1? So secret E is not at five? So our ERODE? We put E at first and fifth? But fifth would be marked? Because secret E not at five? So our fifth E? Should be marked \'x\'? If E is not at five? But we know E is in the secret? At a different position? \n\nTo maximize new letters? ERODE has duplicated E? \n\nSo ERUPT? or ERGOT? \n\nAlso? ERGOT contains O? Which is a vowel? And G,T? \n\nERUPT? U,P,T? \n\nBut P is common? \n\nHow about EMBER? But M? And R not at second? \n\nERUPT seems reasonable? \n\nAnd ERGOT too? \n\nAlso? We haven\'t tested T? \n\nBut T is common? \n\nSo? \n\nLet me pick ERUPT? \n\nThen? \n\nFeedback? \n\nIf E is at first? Then we get E✓? R✓? And U,P,T? \n\nIf E is marked \'-\'? Then we know E must be at fourth? And U,P,T may be? \n\nBut also? We would know that the secret word does not have E at first? \n\nSo? \n\nTherefore? We guess ERUPT? \n\nNow? \n\nBut we must not use absent letters? So U,P,T are possible? \n\nSo the guess: ERUPT? \n\nAlso? It is a valid word? \n\nTherefore? \n\nStep-by-step: \n- Only possible positions for E: 1 or 4? \n- Choose a word with E at 1? to test it? \n- The word ERUPT: E R U P T? \n- If E is ✓? Then we know position 1 is E? And we get info on U,P,T? \n- If E is marked \'-\'? Then E must be at position 4? And we get info on U,P,T for other positions? \n\nAnd since U,P,T are new letters? We gain info? \n\nSo? \n\nWe choose ERUPT? \n\nBut what about position 4? \n\nAnother word? Like PERIL? But P E R I L? R not at second? Avoid? \n\nSo ERUPT? \n\nPut:\n\nGuess: ERUPT? \n\nThen feedback? \n\nFinally? \n\nIn the response? \n\n<guess>erupt</guess>? \n\nBut wait? \n\nAlternative? \n\nWe could choose a word that might have E at 4? but I think ERUPT is fine? \n\nYes?Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane**\n  - C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - Reveals: R is in the word at position 2, E is present but not at position 5, C/A/N are absent.\n- **Guess 2: fresh**\n  - F(x), R(✓), E(-), S(x), H(x)\n  - Reveals: R is still correctly placed at position 2, E is present but not at position 3, F/S/H are absent.\n\n### What We Know:\n- **Pattern:** The word must be `_ R _ _ _` (R fixed at position 2).\n- **E position:** E is in the word but cannot be at positions 3, 5, or 2 (since position 2 is R). Therefore, E must be at position 1 or 4.\n- **Absent letters:** C, A, N, F, S, H. These cannot appear in the secret word.\n- **Remaining tries:** 4 attempts left (out of 6).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Focus on narrowing down E\'s position by placing it at position 1 (if E is at position 1, it will show ✓; else, - would confirm it must be at position 4).\n- Test new common letters to gain info on other positions. Avoid absent letters.\n- **Selected word: ERUPT** (E at position 1, R at 2, U at 3, P at 4, T at 5). This tests:\n  - E at position 1: If ✓, E is at 1; if -, E must be at position 4.\n  - U, P, T: New letters not previously tested—feedback will reveal if they are in the word and where.\n  - Avoids absent letters (C/A/N/F/S/H) and uses distinct letters for maximum information.\n\nThis guess efficiently targets E\'s position while covering common consonants (P, T) and a vowel (U).\n\n<guess>erupt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: fresh -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)\nGuess 3: erupt -> FEEDBACK: E(-) R(✓) U(x) P(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""fresh""\n- F: absent (x)\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3\n- S: absent (x)\n- H: absent (x)\n\nGuess 3: ""erupt""\n- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 1\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- U: absent (x)\n- P: present but wrong position (-) -> so P is in the word, but not at position 4\n- T: absent (x)\n\nWhat we know:\n1.

Thus, E must be at position 4.\n\n3. The letter P is in the word, but not at position 4 (from guess3: P at position 4 was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, no: in ""erupt"", P was at position 4 and marked as ""-"", meaning P is in the word but not at position 4. So P is present, but must be in a different position.\n\n4. Absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T (from all feedbacks: C,A,N from guess1; F,S,H from guess2; U,T from guess3)\n\n5.

But P is present? So we must include P? And the other letters must be from the available set? But we don\'t know? We have to guess.\n\nBut we know the word has at least R, E, P? And two more letters? \n\nNow, for the next guess, we must form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R at position 2\n- Has E at position 4 (since we deduced E must be at 4? But we haven\'t confirmed? Actually, we deduced it? But we can test? But we are sure? Because all other positions are ruled out? So we can set E at 4? And if it is correct? Then it will be marked ✓? If not? But we think it must be? So we can build on that? \n\nBut to be safe? We can design a word that has E at 4? And P at one of the other positions? And avoid absent letters.\n\nSo pattern: ? R ? E ? \n\nAnd we know P must be in the word? So we can put P at position 1, 3, or 5? And use common letters for the other positions? \n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters: C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But P is already in the word? So we can use it? \n\nNow, common letters? We might try to use vowels? But we have E? So perhaps I or O? \n\nBut let\'s list possible words that fit the pattern: _ R _ E _ \n\nAnd contain P? And avoid absent letters.\n\nExamples:\n- PRICE? But C is absent? Avoid.\n- BRIDE? But D? and E at 5? But we have E at 4? So BRIDE: B-R-I-D-E? But E at 5? Not at 4? So not matching pattern? We need E at 4? So the word must have the fourth letter E? \n\nSo BRIDE? has E at fifth? So not.\n\n- PRONE? But N absent? Avoid.\n\n- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? \n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E? So the word must end with E? No? Fourth letter E? Then fifth letter is something else? \n\nSo words like: \n  ? R ? E ? \n\nFor example: \n- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? \n\nActually, we need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: ... E at the fourth position? \n\nFor example: \n- PROTE? Not a word? \n- PRUDE? P-R-U-D-E? But U is absent? Avoid? \n- BRUTE? B-R-U-T-E? U and T absent? Avoid? \n- WRITE? W-R-I-T-E? T absent? Avoid? \n\nSo we need to avoid U and T? \n\nHow about: \n- PRIDE? P-R-I-D-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? \n\nWe need a word with E at the fourth position? \n\nFor example: \n- BARRE? Not a common word? And A absent? \n- CARRE? C absent? \n- DARRE? Not a word? \n\nAnother: \n- PERSE? But P-E-R-S-E? Not matching pattern? We need R at second? \n\nPattern: position 1: ?, 2: R, 3: ?, 4: E, 5: ? \n\nSo: \n- Position 1: must be a letter? \n- Position 3: must be a letter? \n- Position 5: must be a letter? \n\nAnd the word must be English? \n\nExamples: \n- GRADE? G-R-A-D-E? But A is absent? Avoid? \n- GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? \n- GRIME? G-R-I-M-E? But E at fifth? \n\nI think I\'m confused? \n\nLet me clarify: \nWe need the fourth letter to be E? So the word has the form: \nLetter1, R, Letter3, E, Letter5\n\nFor example: \n- PROBE? P-R-O-B-E? -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3), B(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4? So not? \n\n- How about: PRIME? P-R-I-M-E? -> P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), E(5) -> E at 5? \n\nWe need E at position 4? \n\nSo: \n- The fourth letter is E? So the word is: ...X E Y? Where X is letter3, E is at4, Y is letter5? \n\nFor example: \n- ""IRATE"" -> I-R-A-T-E? But A and T absent? \n- ""ORATE"" -> O-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? \n- ""URATE"" -> U absent? \n\nAnother: ""CRWTH""? Not common? \n\nPerhaps: ""DROVE""? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? \n\nI think I need to find words that have E at the fourth position? \n\nFor example: \n- ""OGRES""? But 6 letters? \n- ""TRIBE""? T-R-I-B-E? E at fifth? \n\nWait, let\'s search: \n5-letter words with R at second and E at fourth? \n\nExamples: \n- ARBOR? But A? and E not at fourth? \n- ARDOR? A? \n- ARMOR? A? \n- BROOD? No E? \n- BROOM? No E? \n- CROWD? C? \n- DROVE? D-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? \n\nActually, I found: \n- ""PRESE"" ? Not common? \n- ""TRICE"" ? T and C? absent? \n- ""WRITE"" ? T absent? \n\nBut we have to avoid absent letters? \n\nAnother: ""BRIDE"" -> B-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? \n\nPerhaps: ""GRIDE""? G-R-I-D-E? E at fifth? \n\nI think I made a mistake? \n\nBut we deduced E must be at position 4? But in English? Are there words with R at second and E at fourth? \n\nFor example: \n- ""PROEM"" ? P-R-O-E-M? But then E is at fourth? Yes! \n  - P(1), R(2), O(3), E(4), M(5) -> pattern matches? \n\nAnd ""PROEM"" is a word? Meaning: a prelude? \n\nAlso, it contains P? Which we know is in the word? \n\nAnd avoids absent letters? C,A,N,F,S,H,U,T? \n\nLetters: P, R, O, E, M? \n\nO and M are new? \n\nSo ""PROEM"" could be a candidate? \n\nBut is it common? But it\'s valid? \n\nAnother: ""GROPE""? G-R-O-P-E? But E at fifth? Not at fourth? \n\n""PROSE""? P-R-O-S-E? But S is absent? Avoid? \n\n""PRONE""? P-R-O-N-E? N absent? Avoid? \n\nSo ""PROEM"" seems a possibility? \n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: \n- Position 1: P? \n- Position 2: R (fixed) \n- Position 3: O \n- Position 4: E (as we deduced) \n- Position 5: M \n\nAnd P is in the word? But we put P at position 1? And we know P is present? But not at position 4? So if P is at position 1? That\'s fine? \n\nAlso, if the secret word has P at position 1? Then it would be marked ✓? Or if not? But we know P is present? So if not at 1? Then it would be marked \'-\'? \n\nBut in this guess? We are also testing O and M? \n\nAnother candidate: ""DROKE""? Not a word? \n\nOr ""BROME""? B-R-O-M-E? E at fifth? \n\nBut ""PROEM"" is a word? \n\nWe can use it? \n\nBut we have to make sure? \n\nAnother: ""GROVE""? G-R-O-V-E? E at fifth? \n\nNot. \n\n""TRODE""? T-R-O-D-E? T absent? \n\nSo I think ""PROEM"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s see if there are better? \n\n""PRICE"" has C? \n\nNo? \n\nSo we go with ""PROEM""? \n\nBut we also have to consider that the secret word might have P at position 3 or 5? \n\nIn ""PROEM"", we put P at 1? \n\nBut we could put P at position 3? For example? \n\nPattern: ? R P E ? \n\nBut then we need a word: ? R P E ? \n\nExamples: \n- ""GRAPE""? G-R-A-P-E? A absent? \n- ""GRIPE""? G-R-I-P-E? E at fifth? \n- ""CRIPE""? C absent? \n- ""TRIPE""? T absent? \n\nNot good? \n\nOr P at position 5: ? R ? E P \n\nBut then the word ends with P? Like ""CRISP""? But C and S absent? \n\nOr ""GRASP""? G-R-A-S-P? A and S absent? \n\nNot good? \n\nSo ""PROEM"" seems a reasonable choice? \n\nTherefore, we guess ""PROEM""? \n\nBut let\'s write it: \n\n<guess>proem</guess>? \n\nBut we must be cautious? \n\nAnother word: ""BROME""? But E at fifth? \n\nNo? \n\n""CREME""? C absent? \n\nSo I think ""PROEM"" is acceptable? \n\nWe\'ll use it? \n\nBut note: in ""PROEM"", the E is at position 4? Which we believe is correct? So if it is? Then it will be marked ✓? And we get info on P, O, M? \n\nIf not? But we are confident? \n\nSo? \n\nFinal decision: guess ""PROEM"" \n\nBut let\'s double-check the deduction: \n- E must be at position 4? Because: \n  - Not at 1 (from erupt: E at1 marked -)\n  - Not at 3 (from fresh: E at3 marked -)\n  - Not at 5 (from crane: E at5 marked -)\n  - And position 2 is R? So only position 4 left? \n\nYes? \n\nSo we proceed? \n\n<guess>proem</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - R is correct at position 2.  \n  - E is present but not at position 5.  \n  - C, A, N are absent.  \n- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  \n  - R is correct at position 2.  \n  - E is present but not at position 3.  \n  - F, S, H are absent.  \n- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  \n  - R is correct at position 2.  \n  - E is present but not at position 1.  \n  - P is present but not at position 4.  \n  - U, T are absent.  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **R position**: Fixed at position 2.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""fresh""
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3
- S: absent (x)
- H: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""erupt""
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- U: absent (x)
- P: present but wrong position (-) -> so P is in the word, but not at position 4
- T: absent (x)

Guess 4: ""proem""
- P: correct (✓) at position 1
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- O: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 4
- M: absent (x)

What we now know:
1. The secret word has P at position 1 and R at position 2 and E at position 4: so the pattern is P R ? E ? 
   - Position 1: P (✓)
   - Position 2: R (✓)
   - Position 4: E (✓)
   - Position 3: unknown
   - Position 5: unknown

2. The letter E is confirmed at position 4? Which matches our deduction.

3. We also know from ""proem"" that O and M are absent.

4. Present letters: P, R, E? And from ""erupt"" we know P is present? But it's now placed? Also, we have E? And R? So the secret word contains at least P, R, E? And one more letter? Two more? Because we have two open positions? Position 3 and 5? So the secret word has two more letters.

5. Absent letters: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T, O, M? (from all feedback: C,A,N from guess1; F,S,H from guess2; U,T from guess3; O,M from guess4)

So overall absent: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T, O, M

Available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But P,R,E are already known? So for positions 3 and 5? we need to choose two letters? But the word may have repeated letters? But not necessarily.

We also know from guess3: P is presented? And now placed at position 1? But we have no indication that P appears twice? So probably not? Similarly, R and E are placed? So the remaining letters at position 3 and 5 are distinct? Probably.

Now, for the next guess? We have to fill positions 3 and 5? With letters that are not absent? And form a valid English word?

The pattern: P R ? E ? 

And the word must be English? Common? 

We need to choose letters for position 3 and 5? 

Available letters: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

But common letters? Like B, D, G, I, K, L, etc? 

Possible words? 

Examples:
- ""PRIDE"": P-R-I-D-E? But we have E at position 4? In ""PRIDE"", E is at position 5? So the pattern: P R I D E? But then position 4: D? and E would be at 5? But in the secret word, E is at position 4? So ""PRIDE"" has D at 4 and E at 5? But we need E at 4? So not matching? We cannot use words that don't have E at position 4? 

Therefore, we must have words that are P R ? E ? 

So the word: 
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: Letter3
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: Letter5

So examples:
- ""PRIED"": P-R-I-E-D? But note: E is at position 4? Yes? So ""P-R-I-E-D"" -> positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5)? That matches pattern? 

Also, ""PRIED"" is a word (past tense of pry).

Other possibilities:
- ""PRYER""? But then P-R-Y-E-R? But R at position 5? And E at 4? That's P R Y E R? So repeated R? But it avoids absent letters? 

But ""PRYER"": letters P,R,Y,E,R? 

But R repeated? 

Similarly, ""PREED""? Not common? 

""PLEED""? Not a word? 

Other: 
- ""PRUDE""? But U absent? Avoid? 
- ""PROKE""? Not a word? 
- ""PRESE""? S absent? 

So ""PRIED"" seems valid: P-R-I-E-D? 

Another: ""PRIME""? P-R-I-M-E? But M absent? Avoid? 

""PRICE""? C absent? 

""PRONE""? N and O absent? 

So ""PRIED"" uses I at 3 and D at 5? 

Both are available? 

Also, ""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E? But then position 4: D? and E at 5? But that would not have E at 4? So we cannot use? 

But ""PRIED"" has E at 4? 

Similarly, we can have ""PLIED""? P-L-I-E-D? But L? 

But ""PLIED"": letters P,L,I,E,D? 

Also valid? 

But let's list:

Possible words that fit P R ? E ? 

- ""PRIED"": P-R-I-E-D -> letters: P,R,I,E,D? We haven't tested I or D? 
- ""PLIED"": P-R? No? PLIED: P-L-I-E-D? But second letter L? Not R? Wait? The pattern is P R ? So P and R at 1 and 2? So ""PLIED"" is P-L? not P-R? 

So only words starting with PR?

So pattern: PR?E? 

With E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""PRAXE""? Not common? 
- ""PRESE""? But S absent? 
- ""PRUNE""? U absent? 
- ""PRIED"": as above? 

Another: ""PROLE""? P-R-O-L-E? But O absent? Avoid? 

""PRATE""? P-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? 

""PRISE""? P-R-I-S-E? S absent? 

So ""PRIED"" seems a good candidate? 

Another: ""PRICE""? but C? 

Not? 

""PRINK""? P-R-I-N-K? N absent? 

""PRIMP""? P-R-I-M-P? M absent? 

So ""PRIED"" uses I and D? 

Both not tested? And available? 

We could try ""PRIED""? 

But we have position 5: D? 

If we guess ""PRIED"", and the secret is ""PRIED"", then we win? 

If not? We get feedback? 

Also, we have one more common word: ""PRIDE""? But doesn't fit? 

Another possibility: ""GROPE""? But not starting with PR? 

So ""PRIED"" is a valid choice? 

But let's see? 

Also, note: the secret word might have a different letter at position 3 or 5? 

But we can only try? 

Since position 4 is E? And 1 P? 2 R? Then for position 3: say I? Position 5: D? 

Also, from the past? We don't know any other constraints? 

So we guess ""PRIED""? But we must avoid used up letters? 

In ""PRIED""? Letters: P, R, I, E, D? 

We know P, R, E are already confirmed? So we are testing I and D? 

Also, if the secret word is for example ""PRYER""? But R at 5? And Y at 3? And avoids absent letters? 

But we don't know? We can try? 

But ""PRIED"" uses I and D? Which are common? 

So let's choose ""PRIED""? 

Then feedback? 

Therefore? 

<guess>pried</guess>? 

But we have two tries left? After this? 

So? 

Yes? 

Alternatively? Since we have P,R,?E? We can also try words like ""PREDY""? Not common? 

I think ""PRIED"" is fine? 

So?
</think>
### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 3.  
  - F, S, H are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 1.  
  - P is present but not at position 4.  
  - U, T are absent.  
- **Guess 4 (proem)**:  
  - P is correct at position 1.  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is correct at position 4.  
  - O, M are absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `P R ? E ?` (P at position 1, R at 2, E at 4).  
2. **Open positions**: Only positions 3 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T, O, M (cannot appear).  
4. **Present letters**: P (pos 1), R (pos 2), E (pos 4) — all confirmed.  
5. **Remaining letters**: The secret word contains exactly two more distinct letters (no evidence of repetition). Available options: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Target positions 3 and 5**: Test common letters (e.g., I, D) that form valid English words.  
- **Chosen word: PRIED**  
  - Fits the pattern `P R I E D`.  
  - Tests I at position 3 and D at position 5.  
  - Avoids all absent letters and maximizes information (I and D are high-frequency).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If `I` and `D` are correct, we solve the word.  
  - If only one is correct, we narrow possibilities for the next guess.  
  - If both are incorrect, we eliminate I/D and focus on other letters (e.g., G, L).  

This guess efficiently reduces uncertainty by focusing on the remaining positions with plausible letters.

- ""PRUDE""? But U absent? Avoid? 
- ""PROKE""? Not a word? 
- ""PRESE""? S absent? 

So ""PRIED"" seems valid: P-R-I-E-D? 

Another: ""PRIME""? P-R-I-M-E? But M absent? Avoid? 

""PRICE""? C absent? 

""PRONE""? N and O absent? 

So ""PRIED"" uses I at 3 and D at 5? 

Both are available? 

Also, ""PRIDE"" is P-R-I-D-E? But then position 4: D? and E at 5? But that would not have E at 4? So we cannot use? 

But ""PRIED"" has E at 4? 

Similarly, we can have ""PLIED""? P-L-I-E-D? But L? 

But ""PLIED"": letters P,L,I,E,D? 

Also valid? 

But let's list:

Possible words that fit P R ? E ? 

- ""PRIED"": P-R-I-E-D -> letters: P,R,I,E,D? We haven't tested I or D? 
- ""PLIED"": P-R? No? PLIED: P-L-I-E-D? But second letter L? Not R? Wait? The pattern is P R ? So P and R at 1 and 2? So ""PLIED"" is P-L? not P-R? 

So only words starting with PR?

So pattern: PR?E? 

With E at position 4? 

Examples: 
- ""PRAXE""? Not common? 
- ""PRESE""? But S absent? 
- ""PRUNE""? U absent? 
- ""PRIED"": as above? 

Another: ""PROLE""? P-R-O-L-E? But O absent? Avoid? 

""PRATE""? P-R-A-T-E? A and T absent? 

""PRISE""? P-R-I-S-E? S absent? 

So ""PRIED"" seems a good candidate? 

Another: ""PRICE""? but C? 

Not? 

""PRINK""? P-R-I-N-K? N absent? 

""PRIMP""? P-R-I-M-P? M absent? 

So ""PRIED"" uses I and D? 

Both not tested? And available? 

We could try ""PRIED""? 

But we have position 5: D? 

If we guess ""PRIED"", and the secret is ""PRIED"", then we win? 

If not? We get feedback? 

Also, we have one more common word: ""PRIDE""? But doesn't fit? 

Another possibility: ""GROPE""? But not starting with PR? 

So ""PRIED"" is a valid choice? 

But let's see? 

Also, note: the secret word might have a different letter at position 3 or 5? 

But we can only try? 

Since position 4 is E? And 1 P? 2 R? Then for position 3: say I? Position 5: D? 

Also, from the past? We don't know any other constraints? 

So we guess ""PRIED""? But we must avoid used up letters? 

In ""PRIED""? Letters: P, R, I, E, D? 

We know P, R, E are already confirmed? So we are testing I and D? 

Also, if the secret word is for example ""PRYER""? But R at 5? And Y at 3? And avoids absent letters? 

But we don't know? We can try? 

But ""PRIED"" uses I and D? Which are common? 

So let's choose ""PRIED""? 

Then feedback? 

Therefore? 

<guess>pried</guess>? 

But we have two tries left? After this? 

So? 

Yes? 

Alternatively? Since we have P,R,?E? We can also try words like ""PREDY""? Not common? 

I think ""PRIED"" is fine? 

So?### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 5.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (fresh)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 3.  
  - F, S, H are absent.  
- **Guess 3 (erupt)**:  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is present but not at position 1.  
  - P is present but not at position 4.  
  - U, T are absent.  
- **Guess 4 (proem)**:  
  - P is correct at position 1.  
  - R is correct at position 2.  
  - E is correct at position 4.  
  - O, M are absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Pattern**: The secret word is `P R ? E ?` (P at position 1, R at 2, E at 4).  
2. **Open positions**: Only positions 3 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, F, S, H, U, T, O, M (cannot appear).  
4. **Present letters**: P (pos 1), R (pos 2), E (pos 4) — all confirmed.  
5. **Remaining letters**: The secret word contains exactly two more distinct letters (no evidence of repetition). Available options: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Target positions 3 and 5**: Test common letters (e.g., I, D) that form valid English words.  
- **Chosen word: PRIED**  
  - Fits the pattern `P R I E D`.  
  - Tests I at position 3 and D at position 5.  
  - Avoids all absent letters and maximizes information (I and D are high-frequency).  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If `I` and `D` are correct, we solve the word.  
  - If only one is correct, we narrow possibilities for the next guess.  
  - If both are incorrect, we eliminate I/D and focus on other letters (e.g., G, L).  

This guess efficiently reduces uncertainty by focusing on the remaining positions with plausible letters.",Guess 5: pried -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
