We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> present, but not in the 3rd position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, the secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - It includes 'A' (somewhere except position 3).
 - It does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since many words contain 'S', 'T', and other common letters, we can choose a word that avoids the excluded letters and places 'A' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'A': 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

 We also want to test new common letters to gather more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not use C, R, N, E (excluded).
 - Contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position.
 - Includes other common letters such as S, T, B, D, G, etc.

 Examples: 
   We can try words like: ""SALAD"", ""PASTA"", ""MANGO"" -> but note:
      MANGO: M is not excluded? We haven't eliminated M yet. But wait, our feedback says:
          C, R, N, E are out. So N is excluded, but M is allowed? However, we see ""crane"" had N: x, so no N.
      Let's avoid N.

 Actually, from feedback: N is excluded so we can't use N.

 So ""MANGO"" is invalid because of N? Also, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another idea: Consider ""STAND"". But let's check:
   S, T, A, N, D -> N is excluded? Yes, because in ""crane"" N was x -> so no.

 We need a word without C, R, N, E and with 'A' not in the 3rd.

 How about ""PASTA"":
   P, A, S, T, A -> but note, word must be 5 letters? And we have two A's? The word ""pasta"" has two A's? 
   Actually, ""pasta"" has 5 letters: P-A-S-T-A.

 But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we can try.

 But let's see the feedback rules: 
   If we guess a letter that appears multiple times in the guess, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? 
   However, we don't have that information yet.

 Alternatively, try ""PLAIT"": 
   P, L, A, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E, and A is in the 3rd? We want A not in 3rd? Wait, in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. 
   So placing A in position 3 again would be unwise because we know it's not there? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, we will get another '-' unless it is actually in the 3rd? But we know it's not, so we shouldn't place A in the 3rd.

 Therefore, for our next word, let's put 'A' in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Another word: ""SAULT"" (if valid) or ""SALTY"".

 Let's consider common words: 
   ""SALAD"": has two A's? And D is not excluded? But we have: S, A, L, A, D -> but N and E are excluded? That's fine? But R and C are excluded too? This word avoids them.

 However, let's check: 
   First letter S: not tested -> test it.
   A: now in position 2 -> different from the first time.
   L: new.
   D: new.

 But we also have another A at the end? Actually, ""salad"" has 5 letters: S-A-L-A-D -> so position: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAID"": 
   S, T, A, I, D -> avoids excluded letters: no C, R, N, E? 
   Also, A is in position 3? But we know from last time that A is not in position 3? 
   So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, let's pick a word with A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me list:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Examples: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""AGENT"" -> but ""ABOUT"": has O (not excluded), U (not excluded), T (good). But we also want to test new letters.
   However, we must exclude C,R,N,E -> so ""about"" is okay? Does it have excluded? No.

   But we also want to cover more common consonants.

 Another word: ""STALE"" -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded? From ""crane"": E was x -> so E is not in the word. So avoid E.

 Therefore, ""STALE"" is not allowed? Because E is present.

 So: 
   Avoid: C, R, N, E.

 What about letters: S, T, L are good? We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: ""AISLE"" -> also has E? Excluded.

 Let me think of words that avoid C,R,N,E and have A? 

   Common words: 
     ""PLAIT"" -> has I and T? But A is in position 3? We should avoid that.

   ""ALTAR"": 
      Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:T, 4:A, 5:R -> R is excluded? Yes! So we cannot use R.

   ""ADAPT"": 
      A, D, A, P, T -> avoid: C,R,N,E? It does avoid? 
      Position: A at 1 and 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for A? Actually, we are not sure if the word can have A at multiple positions? 
      However, note: we know that A is in the word, so if we put A in position 3 we'll get '-' again? We don't want to waste a position? 

      But if the word has two A's, then we might get two '-'? 

   However, let's focus on getting more information.

   I propose ""PASTA"": 
        P, A, S, T, A -> 
        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? 

        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? 

        Also, we test P, S, T.

   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: 
        The feedback for each letter: 
          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -
          Else: x

        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get '-' and the other 'x'. 

   That's okay? We can get information.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? 

   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   Look for a word: 
        Start with S? because S is very common? 

   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? 
        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? 

   ""SALTY"": 
        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? 
        A is in position 2? 

        This avoids C,R,N,E? 

   Let's choose ""SALTY"". 

   Why not? 

   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. 

   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.

   We know A isn't the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.

   It also tests L and T? We haven't tested L or T before.

   That seems good.

 So, next guess: ""SALTY""

<guess>salty</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  
- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  

For the next guess:  
- Must exclude C, R, N, E  
- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  
- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  

The word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  
- Contains A in position 2  
- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  
- No C, R, N, E  
- Valid English word

 We need a word without C, R, N, E and with 'A' not in the 3rd.

 How about ""PASTA"":
   P, A, S, T, A -> but note, word must be 5 letters? And we have two A's? The word ""pasta"" has two A's? 
   Actually, ""pasta"" has 5 letters: P-A-S-T-A.

 But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we can try.

 But let's see the feedback rules: 
   If we guess a letter that appears multiple times in the guess, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? 
   However, we don't have that information yet.

 Alternatively, try ""PLAIT"": 
   P, L, A, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E, and A is in the 3rd? We want A not in 3rd? Wait, in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. 
   So placing A in position 3 again would be unwise because we know it's not there? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, we will get another '-' unless it is actually in the 3rd? But we know it's not, so we shouldn't place A in the 3rd.

 Therefore, for our next word, let's put 'A' in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Another word: ""SAULT"" (if valid) or ""SALTY"".

 Let's consider common words: 
   ""SALAD"": has two A's? And D is not excluded? But we have: S, A, L, A, D -> but N and E are excluded? That's fine? But R and C are excluded too? This word avoids them.

 However, let's check: 
   First letter S: not tested -> test it.
   A: now in position 2 -> different from the first time.
   L: new.
   D: new.

 But we also have another A at the end? Actually, ""salad"" has 5 letters: S-A-L-A-D -> so position: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAID"": 
   S, T, A, I, D -> avoids excluded letters: no C, R, N, E? 
   Also, A is in position 3? But we know from last time that A is not in position 3? 
   So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, let's pick a word with A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me list:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Examples: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""AGENT"" -> but ""ABOUT"": has O (not excluded), U (not excluded), T (good). But we also want to test new letters.
   However, we must exclude C,R,N,E -> so ""about"" is okay? Does it have excluded? No.

   But we also want to cover more common consonants.

 Another word: ""STALE"" -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded? From ""crane"": E was x -> so E is not in the word. So avoid E.

 Therefore, ""STALE"" is not allowed? Because E is present.

 So: 
   Avoid: C, R, N, E.

 What about letters: S, T, L are good? We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: ""AISLE"" -> also has E? Excluded.

 Let me think of words that avoid C,R,N,E and have A? 

   Common words: 
     ""PLAIT"" -> has I and T? But A is in position 3? We should avoid that.

   ""ALTAR"": 
      Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:T, 4:A, 5:R -> R is excluded? Yes! So we cannot use R.

   ""ADAPT"": 
      A, D, A, P, T -> avoid: C,R,N,E? It does avoid? 
      Position: A at 1 and 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for A? Actually, we are not sure if the word can have A at multiple positions? 
      However, note: we know that A is in the word, so if we put A in position 3 we'll get '-' again? We don't want to waste a position? 

      But if the word has two A's, then we might get two '-'? 

   However, let's focus on getting more information.

   I propose ""PASTA"": 
        P, A, S, T, A -> 
        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? 

        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? 

        Also, we test P, S, T.

   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: 
        The feedback for each letter: 
          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -
          Else: x

        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get '-' and the other 'x'. 

   That's okay? We can get information.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? 

   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   Look for a word: 
        Start with S? because S is very common? 

   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? 
        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? 

   ""SALTY"": 
        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? 
        A is in position 2? 

        This avoids C,R,N,E? 

   Let's choose ""SALTY"". 

   Why not? 

   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. 

   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.

   We know A isn't the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.

   It also tests L and T? We haven't tested L or T before.

   That seems good.

 So, next guess: ""SALTY""

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  
- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  

For the next guess:  
- Must exclude C, R, N, E  
- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  
- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  

The word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  
- Contains A in position 2  
- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  
- No C, R, N, E  
- Valid English word

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S and Y are not in the word.
- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? 
  Let's see the positions:
  In ""salty"":
    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)
    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)
    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)
    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)
    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)

So overall, we know:
- The word contains the letters: A, L, T
- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y
- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

Also, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.

We need to use this information to form a new guess.

Requirements:
- Must include A, L, T (they are present)
- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)
- Must be a valid English word.

Additionally, we have information about incorrect positions:
For A:
  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? 
  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.

For L:
  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got '-'. 
  But L could be in other positions? 

For T:
  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got '-'.

Also, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters? But we know it's 5 letters.

We don't know what the remaining two letters are? We must try to include two new letters that aren't excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, Y
So remaining letters? Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? 

Note: We cannot use the excluded ones.

Moreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? 

Let me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? 

Available letters: almost the rest? But let's list common? 
B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? 

We also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.

Consider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Case 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _

Case 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _

Case 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A

Also, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

We might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.

But note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get '-'? Similarly for L and T? 

We also have limited guesses? Let's think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? 

Example: 
Let me try position 1: A _ _ _ _
Now we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? 
Also, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? 
Similarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?

Possible word: 
  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? 

So if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? 
But we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? 

What letters for the other positions? And we must include common? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALBAT"" -> but that's not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? 
  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? 

""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.

""ALOFT"": 
   A, L, O, F, T -> 
   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T
   Now check restrictions:
      A in pos1 -> allowed.
      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? 
      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? 
      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? 

   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? 
      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it's in pos2? Which we don't know? That's fine? 
      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That's different.

   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? 

   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? 

   However, let's see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? 

   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? 

   So let's try ""aloft"".

But wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? 

Another possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _
We need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That's taken by A.

So T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that's fine.

For example: 
   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? 
   Word: L T ? A ?
   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? 

Another: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? 

Actually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:

Possible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.

To make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? 

But note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? 

Alternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? 

List: 
   ""basalt"" too long? 
   ""metal"" -> too short? 
   ""plate"" -> E excluded? 
   ""slant"" -> S excluded? 
   ""latch"" -> C excluded? 
   ""delta"" -> E excluded? 
   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? 

Actually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? 
Because in ""salty"" we tried position2? 

Similarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.

""alto"": too short? 

""malt"": too short? 

""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? 

Maybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A
We need to put L and T? 

Word: ... A? 
Example: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> 
   But A in position5? 
   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A
   Check restrictions: 
      A: position5? okay? 
      L: position2? okay? 
      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? 
      So if we put T in position4, we would get a '-'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? 
      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? 
      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got '-'. 
      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? 
      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? 

We must avoid putting T in position4? 

So back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": 
   Positions: 
      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5
   Check:
      A in position1 -> okay? 
      L in position2 -> we haven't tried? Maybe okay? 
      T in position5 -> okay? 
      Also, T not in position4? 
      L not in position3? 

   So the positions we are testing: 
      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? 
      L:2 -> might be? 
      O:3 -> new
      F:4 -> new
      T:5 -> ✓ or ? 

   This seems valid? 

But note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven't tested position2? 

But the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn't been tested? 

Also, what other words? 

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? 

""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? 

""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? 

""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> 
   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". 
   So cannot put A in position2? 

""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? 

So perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there's a word that avoids using F and O? 

Maybe ""ADULT"": 
   A,D,U,L,T -> 
   Positions: 
      A:1 -> okay? 
      D:2 -> new
      U:3 -> new
      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? 
      T:5 -> okay? 
   But does it include all? A,L,T? 

   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? 

   Word: ""ADULT""

   Now, positions:
      A at1: okay? 
      L at4: okay? 
      T at5: okay? 

   Also, this word tests U and D? 

   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?

Since we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? 

But note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? 

But we have to decide? 

Also, ""adult"": 
   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? 
   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? 

   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven't tried L in position4? 

So both words are valid? 

However, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? 

Another word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? 

I think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: 
   A at position1? okay? 
   L at position4? and we know L is present? 
   T at position5? and we know T is present? 

And the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was '-' meaning it's present but not in the guessed positions? 
In both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? 

Similarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? 

So guess ""adult"".

But let me check: 

   Guess: adult
   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T

   We expect that:
      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? 
      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? 
      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? 
      Also, we test D and U? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? 

So avoid? 

Another: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? 
   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O

   But here: 
      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got '-'. 
      So we cannot put A in position2? 

Hence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? 

Another word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? 

So I choose ""adult""? 

But consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? 
And avoids excluded? 

Therefore, I guess ""adult"".

If we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? 

But note: we haven't ruled out all? 

We can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? 

So ""adult"" it is.

<guess>adult</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3). Excludes C, R, N, E.

- **Guess 2: salty**  
  Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x) → Reveals A, L, T are present, but A not in position 2, L not in position 3, T not in position 4. Excludes S, Y.

**Summary of known constraints:**
1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  
3. **Position rules**:  
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  
   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  

This narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5. The new guess must include A, L, T and two additional letters not in the excluded list. Valid letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- **Goal**: Prioritize placing A in position 1 (untested position) to efficiently verify if it's correct, while avoiding invalid positions for L and T.  
- **Chosen word: adult**  
  - A in position 1 → Tests possible position for A (position 1).  
  - L in position 4 → Avoids position 3 (invalid for L).  
  - T in position 5 → Avoids position 4 (invalid for T).  
  - New letters tested: D (position 2), U (position 3).  
- **Why ""adult""?**  
  - Fits all constraints: Contains A, L, T; excludes C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
  - Tests new common letters (D, U) for faster deduction.  
  - Avoids repeating known invalid positions for A/L/T.  

<guess>adult</guess>",adult,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S and Y are not in the word.
- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? 
  Let's see the positions:
  In ""salty"":
    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)
    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)
    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)
    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)
    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)

So overall, we know:
- The word contains the letters: A, L, T
- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y
- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

Also, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.

We need to use this information to form a new guess.

Requirements:
- Must include A, L, T (they are present)
- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)
- Must be a valid English word.

Additionally, we have information about incorrect positions:
For A:
  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? 
  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.

For L:
  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got '-'. 
  But L could be in other positions? 

For T:
  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got '-'.

Also, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters? But we know it's 5 letters.

We don't know what the remaining two letters are? We must try to include two new letters that aren't excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, Y
So remaining letters? Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? 

Note: We cannot use the excluded ones.

Moreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? 

Let me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? 

Available letters: almost the rest? But let's list common? 
B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? 

We also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.

Consider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Case 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _

Case 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _

Case 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A

Also, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

We might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.

But note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get '-'? Similarly for L and T? 

We also have limited guesses? Let's think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? 

Example: 
Let me try position 1: A _ _ _ _
Now we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? 
Also, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? 
Similarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?

Possible word: 
  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? 

So if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? 
But we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? 

What letters for the other positions? And we must include common? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALBAT"" -> but that's not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? 
  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? 

""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.

""ALOFT"": 
   A, L, O, F, T -> 
   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T
   Now check restrictions:
      A in pos1 -> allowed.
      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? 
      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? 
      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? 

   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? 
      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it's in pos2? Which we don't know? That's fine? 
      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That's different.

   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? 

   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? 

   However, let's see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? 

   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? 

   So let's try ""aloft"".

But wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? 

Another possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _
We need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That's taken by A.

So T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that's fine.

For example: 
   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? 
   Word: L T ? A ?
   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? 

Another: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? 

Actually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:

Possible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.

To make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? 

But note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? 

Alternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? 

List: 
   ""basalt"" too long? 
   ""metal"" -> too short? 
   ""plate"" -> E excluded? 
   ""slant"" -> S excluded? 
   ""latch"" -> C excluded? 
   ""delta"" -> E excluded? 
   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? 

Actually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? 
Because in ""salty"" we tried position2? 

Similarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.

""alto"": too short? 

""malt"": too short? 

""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? 

Maybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A
We need to put L and T? 

Word: ... A? 
Example: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> 
   But A in position5? 
   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A
   Check restrictions: 
      A: position5? okay? 
      L: position2? okay? 
      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? 
      So if we put T in position4, we would get a '-'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? 
      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? 
      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got '-'. 
      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? 
      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? 

We must avoid putting T in position4? 

So back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": 
   Positions: 
      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5
   Check:
      A in position1 -> okay? 
      L in position2 -> we haven't tried? Maybe okay? 
      T in position5 -> okay? 
      Also, T not in position4? 
      L not in position3? 

   So the positions we are testing: 
      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? 
      L:2 -> might be? 
      O:3 -> new
      F:4 -> new
      T:5 -> ✓ or ? 

   This seems valid? 

But note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven't tested position2? 

But the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn't been tested? 

Also, what other words? 

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? 

""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? 

""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? 

""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> 
   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". 
   So cannot put A in position2? 

""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? 

So perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there's a word that avoids using F and O? 

Maybe ""ADULT"": 
   A,D,U,L,T -> 
   Positions: 
      A:1 -> okay? 
      D:2 -> new
      U:3 -> new
      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? 
      T:5 -> okay? 
   But does it include all? A,L,T? 

   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? 

   Word: ""ADULT""

   Now, positions:
      A at1: okay? 
      L at4: okay? 
      T at5: okay? 

   Also, this word tests U and D? 

   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?

Since we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? 

But note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? 

But we have to decide? 

Also, ""adult"": 
   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? 
   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? 

   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven't tried L in position4? 

So both words are valid? 

However, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? 

Another word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? 

I think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: 
   A at position1? okay? 
   L at position4? and we know L is present? 
   T at position5? and we know T is present? 

And the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was '-' meaning it's present but not in the guessed positions? 
In both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? 

Similarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? 

So guess ""adult"".

But let me check: 

   Guess: adult
   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T

   We expect that:
      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? 
      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? 
      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? 
      Also, we test D and U? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? 

So avoid? 

Another: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? 
   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O

   But here: 
      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got '-'. 
      So we cannot put A in position2? 

Hence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? 

Another word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? 

So I choose ""adult""? 

But consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? 
And avoids excluded? 

Therefore, I guess ""adult"".

If we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? 

But note: we haven't ruled out all? 

We can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? 

So ""adult"" it is.

<guess>adult</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3). Excludes C, R, N, E.

- **Guess 2: salty**  
  Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x) → Reveals A, L, T are present, but A not in position 2, L not in position 3, T not in position 4. Excludes S, Y.

**Summary of known constraints:**
1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  
3. **Position rules**:  
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  
   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  

This narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5. The new guess must include A, L, T and two additional letters not in the excluded list. Valid letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> present, but not in the 3rd position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, the secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - It includes 'A' (somewhere except position 3).
 - It does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since many words contain 'S', 'T', and other common letters, we can choose a word that avoids the excluded letters and places 'A' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'A': 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

 We also want to test new common letters to gather more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not use C, R, N, E (excluded).
 - Contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position.
 - Includes other common letters such as S, T, B, D, G, etc.

 Examples: 
   We can try words like: ""SALAD"", ""PASTA"", ""MANGO"" -> but note:
      MANGO: M is not excluded? We haven't eliminated M yet. But wait, our feedback says:
          C, R, N, E are out. So N is excluded, but M is allowed? However, we see ""crane"" had N: x, so no N.
      Let's avoid N.

 Actually, from feedback: N is excluded so we can't use N.

 So ""MANGO"" is invalid because of N? Also, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another idea: Consider ""STAND"". But let's check:
   S, T, A, N, D -> N is excluded? Yes, because in ""crane"" N was x -> so no.

 We need a word without C, R, N, E and with 'A' not in the 3rd.

 How about ""PASTA"":
   P, A, S, T, A -> but note, word must be 5 letters? And we have two A's? The word ""pasta"" has two A's? 
   Actually, ""pasta"" has 5 letters: P-A-S-T-A.

 But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we can try.

 But let's see the feedback rules: 
   If we guess a letter that appears multiple times in the guess, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? 
   However, we don't have that information yet.

 Alternatively, try ""PLAIT"": 
   P, L, A, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E, and A is in the 3rd? We want A not in 3rd? Wait, in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. 
   So placing A in position 3 again would be unwise because we know it's not there? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, we will get another '-' unless it is actually in the 3rd? But we know it's not, so we shouldn't place A in the 3rd.

 Therefore, for our next word, let's put 'A' in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Another word: ""SAULT"" (if valid) or ""SALTY"".

 Let's consider common words: 
   ""SALAD"": has two A's? And D is not excluded? But we have: S, A, L, A, D -> but N and E are excluded? That's fine? But R and C are excluded too? This word avoids them.

 However, let's check: 
   First letter S: not tested -> test it.
   A: now in position 2 -> different from the first time.
   L: new.
   D: new.

 But we also have another A at the end? Actually, ""salad"" has 5 letters: S-A-L-A-D -> so position: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAID"": 
   S, T, A, I, D -> avoids excluded letters: no C, R, N, E? 
   Also, A is in position 3? But we know from last time that A is not in position 3? 
   So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, let's pick a word with A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me list:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Examples: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""AGENT"" -> but ""ABOUT"": has O (not excluded), U (not excluded), T (good). But we also want to test new letters.
   However, we must exclude C,R,N,E -> so ""about"" is okay? Does it have excluded? No.

   But we also want to cover more common consonants.

 Another word: ""STALE"" -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded? From ""crane"": E was x -> so E is not in the word. So avoid E.

 Therefore, ""STALE"" is not allowed? Because E is present.

 So: 
   Avoid: C, R, N, E.

 What about letters: S, T, L are good? We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: ""AISLE"" -> also has E? Excluded.

 Let me think of words that avoid C,R,N,E and have A? 

   Common words: 
     ""PLAIT"" -> has I and T? But A is in position 3? We should avoid that.

   ""ALTAR"": 
      Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:T, 4:A, 5:R -> R is excluded? Yes! So we cannot use R.

   ""ADAPT"": 
      A, D, A, P, T -> avoid: C,R,N,E? It does avoid? 
      Position: A at 1 and 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for A? Actually, we are not sure if the word can have A at multiple positions? 
      However, note: we know that A is in the word, so if we put A in position 3 we'll get '-' again? We don't want to waste a position? 

      But if the word has two A's, then we might get two '-'? 

   However, let's focus on getting more information.

   I propose ""PASTA"": 
        P, A, S, T, A -> 
        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? 

        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? 

        Also, we test P, S, T.

   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: 
        The feedback for each letter: 
          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -
          Else: x

        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get '-' and the other 'x'. 

   That's okay? We can get information.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? 

   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   Look for a word: 
        Start with S? because S is very common? 

   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? 
        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? 

   ""SALTY"": 
        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? 
        A is in position 2? 

        This avoids C,R,N,E? 

   Let's choose ""SALTY"". 

   Why not? 

   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. 

   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.

   We know A isn't the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.

   It also tests L and T? We haven't tested L or T before.

   That seems good.

 So, next guess: ""SALTY""

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  
- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  

For the next guess:  
- Must exclude C, R, N, E  
- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  
- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  

The word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  
- Contains A in position 2  
- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  
- No C, R, N, E  
- Valid English word

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S and Y are not in the word.
- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? 
  Let's see the positions:
  In ""salty"":
    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)
    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)
    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)
    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)
    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)

So overall, we know:
- The word contains the letters: A, L, T
- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y
- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

Also, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.

We need to use this information to form a new guess.

Requirements:
- Must include A, L, T (they are present)
- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)
- Must be a valid English word.

Additionally, we have information about incorrect positions:
For A:
  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? 
  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.

For L:
  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got '-'. 
  But L could be in other positions? 

For T:
  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got '-'.

Also, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters? But we know it's 5 letters.

We don't know what the remaining two letters are? We must try to include two new letters that aren't excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, Y
So remaining letters? Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? 

Note: We cannot use the excluded ones.

Moreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? 

Let me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? 

Available letters: almost the rest? But let's list common? 
B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? 

We also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.

Consider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Case 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _

Case 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _

Case 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A

Also, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

We might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.

But note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get '-'? Similarly for L and T? 

We also have limited guesses? Let's think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? 

Example: 
Let me try position 1: A _ _ _ _
Now we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? 
Also, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? 
Similarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?

Possible word: 
  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? 

So if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? 
But we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? 

What letters for the other positions? And we must include common? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALBAT"" -> but that's not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? 
  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? 

""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.

""ALOFT"": 
   A, L, O, F, T -> 
   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T
   Now check restrictions:
      A in pos1 -> allowed.
      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? 
      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? 
      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? 

   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? 
      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it's in pos2? Which we don't know? That's fine? 
      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That's different.

   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? 

   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? 

   However, let's see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? 

   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? 

   So let's try ""aloft"".

But wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? 

Another possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _
We need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That's taken by A.

So T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that's fine.

For example: 
   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? 
   Word: L T ? A ?
   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? 

Another: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? 

Actually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:

Possible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.

To make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? 

But note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? 

Alternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? 

List: 
   ""basalt"" too long? 
   ""metal"" -> too short? 
   ""plate"" -> E excluded? 
   ""slant"" -> S excluded? 
   ""latch"" -> C excluded? 
   ""delta"" -> E excluded? 
   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? 

Actually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? 
Because in ""salty"" we tried position2? 

Similarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.

""alto"": too short? 

""malt"": too short? 

""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? 

Maybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A
We need to put L and T? 

Word: ... A? 
Example: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> 
   But A in position5? 
   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A
   Check restrictions: 
      A: position5? okay? 
      L: position2? okay? 
      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? 
      So if we put T in position4, we would get a '-'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? 
      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? 
      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got '-'. 
      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? 
      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? 

We must avoid putting T in position4? 

So back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": 
   Positions: 
      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5
   Check:
      A in position1 -> okay? 
      L in position2 -> we haven't tried? Maybe okay? 
      T in position5 -> okay? 
      Also, T not in position4? 
      L not in position3? 

   So the positions we are testing: 
      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? 
      L:2 -> might be? 
      O:3 -> new
      F:4 -> new
      T:5 -> ✓ or ? 

   This seems valid? 

But note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven't tested position2? 

But the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn't been tested? 

Also, what other words? 

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? 

""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? 

""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? 

""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> 
   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". 
   So cannot put A in position2? 

""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? 

So perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there's a word that avoids using F and O? 

Maybe ""ADULT"": 
   A,D,U,L,T -> 
   Positions: 
      A:1 -> okay? 
      D:2 -> new
      U:3 -> new
      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? 
      T:5 -> okay? 
   But does it include all? A,L,T? 

   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? 

   Word: ""ADULT""

   Now, positions:
      A at1: okay? 
      L at4: okay? 
      T at5: okay? 

   Also, this word tests U and D? 

   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?

Since we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? 

But note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? 

But we have to decide? 

Also, ""adult"": 
   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? 
   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? 

   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven't tried L in position4? 

So both words are valid? 

However, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? 

Another word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? 

I think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: 
   A at position1? okay? 
   L at position4? and we know L is present? 
   T at position5? and we know T is present? 

And the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was '-' meaning it's present but not in the guessed positions? 
In both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? 

Similarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? 

So guess ""adult"".

But let me check: 

   Guess: adult
   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T

   We expect that:
      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? 
      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? 
      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? 
      Also, we test D and U? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? 

So avoid? 

Another: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? 
   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O

   But here: 
      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got '-'. 
      So we cannot put A in position2? 

Hence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? 

Another word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? 

So I choose ""adult""? 

But consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? 
And avoids excluded? 

Therefore, I guess ""adult"".

If we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? 

But note: we haven't ruled out all? 

We can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? 

So ""adult"" it is.

<guess>adult</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3). Excludes C, R, N, E.

- **Guess 2: salty**  
  Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x) → Reveals A, L, T are present, but A not in position 2, L not in position 3, T not in position 4. Excludes S, Y.

**Summary of known constraints:**
1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  
3. **Position rules**:  
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  
   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  

This narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5. The new guess must include A, L, T and two additional letters not in the excluded list. Valid letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- **Goal**: Prioritize placing A in position 1 (untested position) to efficiently verify if it's correct, while avoiding invalid positions for L and T.  
- **Chosen word: adult**  
  - A in position 1 → Tests possible position for A (position 1).  
  - L in position 4 → Avoids position 3 (invalid for L).  
  - T in position 5 → Avoids position 4 (invalid for T).  
  - New letters tested: D (position 2), U (position 3).  
- **Why ""adult""?**  
  - Fits all constraints: Contains A, L, T; excludes C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
  - Tests new common letters (D, U) for faster deduction.  
  - Avoids repeating known invalid positions for A/L/T.

We don\'t want to waste a position? \n\n      But if the word has two A\'s, then we might get two \'-\'? \n\n   However, let\'s focus on getting more information.\n\n   I propose ""PASTA"": \n        P, A, S, T, A -> \n        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? \n\n        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? \n\n        Also, we test P, S, T.\n\n   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: \n        The feedback for each letter: \n          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -\n          Else: x\n\n        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get \'-\' and the other \'x\'. \n\n   That\'s okay? We can get information.\n\n   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? \n\n   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.\n\n   Look for a word: \n        Start with S? because S is very common? \n\n   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? \n        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? \n\n   ""SALTY"": \n        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? \n        A is in position 2? \n\n        This avoids C,R,N,E? \n\n   Let\'s choose ""SALTY"". \n\n   Why not? \n\n   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. \n\n   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\n   We know A isn\'t the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.\n\n   It also tests L and T? We haven\'t tested L or T before.\n\n   That seems good.\n\n So, next guess: ""SALTY""\n\n<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  \n- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  \n- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must exclude C, R, N, E  \n- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  \n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  \n- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  \n\nThe word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  \n- Contains A in position 2  \n- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  \n- No C, R, N, E  \n- Valid English word\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- S and Y are not in the word.\n- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? \n  Let\'s see the positions:\n  In ""salty"":\n    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)\n    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)\n    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)\n    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)\n    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)\n\nSo overall, we know:\n- The word contains the letters: A, L, T\n- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y\n- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.\n\nWe need to use this information to form a new guess.\n\nRequirements:\n- Must include A, L, T (they are present)\n- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)\n- Must be a valid English word.\n\nAdditionally, we have information about incorrect positions:\nFor A:\n  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? \n  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.\n\nFor L:\n  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got \'-\'. \n  But L could be in other positions? \n\nFor T:\n  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got \'-\'.\n\nAlso, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters? But we know it\'s 5 letters.\n\nWe don\'t know what the remaining two letters are? We must try to include two new letters that aren\'t excluded.\n\nExcluded: C, R, N, E, S, Y\nSo remaining letters? Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? \n\nNote: We cannot use the excluded ones.\n\nMoreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? \n\nLet me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? \n\nAvailable letters: almost the rest? But let\'s list common? \nB, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nWe also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.\n\nConsider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nCase 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _\n\nCase 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _\n\nCase 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A\n\nAlso, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? \n\nMoreover, the word must be valid? \n\nWe might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get \'-\'? Similarly for L and T? \n\nWe also have limited guesses? Let\'s think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? \n\nExample: \nLet me try position 1: A _ _ _ _\nNow we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? \nAlso, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? \nSimilarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?\n\nPossible word: \n  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? \n\nSo if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? \nBut we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? \n\nWhat letters for the other positions? And we must include common? \n\nPossible words: \n  ""ALBAT"" -> but that\'s not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? \n  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? \n\n""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.\n\n""ALOFT"": \n   A, L, O, F, T -> \n   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T\n   Now check restrictions:\n      A in pos1 -> allowed.\n      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? \n      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? \n      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? \n\n   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? \n      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it\'s in pos2? Which we don\'t know? That\'s fine? \n      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That\'s different.\n\n   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? \n\n   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? \n\n   However, let\'s see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? \n\n   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? \n\n   So let\'s try ""aloft"".\n\nBut wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? \n\nAnother possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _\nWe need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That\'s taken by A.\n\nSo T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that\'s fine.\n\nFor example: \n   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? \n   Word: L T ? A ?\n   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? \n\nAnother: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? \n\nActually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:\n\nPossible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.\n\nTo make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? \n\nBut note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? \n\nList: \n   ""basalt"" too long? \n   ""metal"" -> too short? \n   ""plate"" -> E excluded? \n   ""slant"" -> S excluded? \n   ""latch"" -> C excluded? \n   ""delta"" -> E excluded? \n   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? \n\nActually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? \nBecause in ""salty"" we tried position2? \n\nSimilarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.\n\n""alto"": too short? \n\n""malt"": too short? \n\n""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? \n\nMaybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A\nWe need to put L and T? \n\nWord: ... A? \nExample: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> \n   But A in position5? \n   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A\n   Check restrictions: \n      A: position5? okay? \n      L: position2? okay? \n      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? \n      So if we put T in position4, we would get a \'-\'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? \n      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? \n      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got \'-\'. \n      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? \n      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? \n\nWe must avoid putting T in position4? \n\nSo back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": \n   Positions: \n      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5\n   Check:\n      A in position1 -> okay? \n      L in position2 -> we haven\'t tried? Maybe okay? \n      T in position5 -> okay? \n      Also, T not in position4? \n      L not in position3? \n\n   So the positions we are testing: \n      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? \n      L:2 -> might be? \n      O:3 -> new\n      F:4 -> new\n      T:5 -> ✓ or ? \n\n   This seems valid? \n\nBut note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven\'t tested position2? \n\nBut the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn\'t been tested? \n\nAlso, what other words? \n\nAnother word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? \n\n""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? \n\n""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? \n\n""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> \n   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". \n   So cannot put A in position2? \n\n""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? \n\nSo perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that avoids using F and O? \n\nMaybe ""ADULT"": \n   A,D,U,L,T -> \n   Positions: \n      A:1 -> okay? \n      D:2 -> new\n      U:3 -> new\n      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? \n      T:5 -> okay? \n   But does it include all? A,L,T? \n\n   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? \n\n   Word: ""ADULT""\n\n   Now, positions:\n      A at1: okay? \n      L at4: okay? \n      T at5: okay? \n\n   Also, this word tests U and D? \n\n   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?\n\nSince we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? \n\nBut note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? \n\nBut we have to decide? \n\nAlso, ""adult"": \n   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? \n   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? \n\n   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven\'t tried L in position4? \n\nSo both words are valid? \n\nHowever, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? \n\nAnother word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? \n\nI think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: \n   A at position1? okay? \n   L at position4? and we know L is present? \n   T at position5? and we know T is present? \n\nAnd the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in the guessed positions? \nIn both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? \n\nSimilarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? \n\nSo guess ""adult"".\n\nBut let me check: \n\n   Guess: adult\n   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T\n\n   We expect that:\n      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? \n      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? \n      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? \n      Also, we test D and U? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? \n\nSo avoid? \n\nAnother: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? \n   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O\n\n   But here: \n      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got \'-\'. \n      So we cannot put A in position2? \n\nHence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? \n\nAnother word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? \n\nSo I choose ""adult""? \n\nBut consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? \nAnd avoids excluded? \n\nTherefore, I guess ""adult"".\n\nIf we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t ruled out all? \n\nWe can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? \n\nSo ""adult"" it is.\n\n<guess>adult</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3).

Excludes S, Y.\n\n**Summary of known constraints:**\n1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  \n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  \n3. **Position rules**:  \n   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  \n   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  \n   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  \n\nThis narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word, not in position 3; and C,R,N,E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning: A, L, T are in the word. But:
  - A not in position 2
  - L not in position 3
  - T not in position 4
And S,Y are absent.

Guess 3: adult -> A(-), D(x), U(x), L(-), T(✓)
Meaning:
  - A: not in position 1 (because we placed A in position 1 and got '-')
  - D: absent
  - U: absent
  - L: not in position 4 (since placed at 4 and got '-')
  - T: correct in position 5! So we know T is the last letter.

Therefore, the secret word has T in position 5: _ _ _ _ T

Also known:
- Letters in the word: A, L, T (and possibly others)
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U
- Position constraints:
  A: cannot be in position 1 (from adult), position 2 (from salty), or position 3 (from crane). 
    Therefore, the only possibility for A is position 4? Because position 5 is T, so A can't be there.
    But positions: 1,2,3 are all forbidden? Then only position 4 remains? 
    However, we also have L to place? 

Wait: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the first four letters? Position 5 is T.

A cannot be in:
  - Position 1: from adult (A(-))
  - Position 2: from salty (A(-))
  - Position 3: from crane (A(-))

Therefore, the only position left for A is position 4? 

But position 4: so the word would be: _ _ _ A L? No, position 5 is T? So _ _ _ A T?

We know L is in the word? But we only have one L? 

Also, from adult: we have L in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 
But now we are placing A in position 4? So L must be elsewhere? 

So secret word: positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:?, 4:A, 5:T? Wait, but we just concluded A must be in position 4? Let me confirm.

Available positions for A: only position 4? Because:
  Position 1: adult gave A(-) -> not at 1.
  Position 2: salty gave A(-) -> not at 2.
  Position 3: crane gave A(-) -> not at 3.
  Position 4 and 5: 5 is T? So only 4.

Therefore, A must be in position 4: so the word ends with ""AT"": ... A T

But wait: the word is _ _ _ A T? 

Also, we know L is in the word? But where? 

L cannot be in:
  - Position 3: from salty (L was in position 3? Actually, in salty: L was in position 3? Let's see: 
        salty: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> feedback L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? 
  - Also from adult: L was in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 

Therefore, L cannot be in position 3 or 4? 

Positions available for L: 1 or 2? Because positions 1,2,3,4: 
  3 and 4 are forbidden? So L must be in position 1 or 2? 

Also, we have one more letter? We know the word contains only A,L,T? Or there might be another? 

We don't have information about the other letter? We only know A,L,T are present? But guess2: salty had 5 letters? Only A,L,T were marked as present? S and Y absent? 
Similarly, adult: we tested D,U and they were absent? 

Therefore, the word must have exactly three of the letters we know: A,L,T? But wait, five letters? So the other two must be new letters? 

But we have many absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? So many letters are still possible? 

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: T
  Position 1 or 2: L? 
  And the remaining two positions: two new letters? 

Moreover, we must not use absent letters? 

So let the word be: 
  [L?] [?] [?] [A] [T]   OR   [?] [L?] [?] [A] [T]

But we cannot put L in positions 3 or 4? So:
  If L is at position 1: then word: L ? ? A T
  If L is at position 2: then word: ? L ? A T

Now, we know position 3 is unknown? 

Also, we have two unknown letters? 

We want to form a valid word? 

Possible words:
  If L at position1: 
      Words: ""LEAPT"" -> but E is absent? (from absent list) -> cannot.
      ""PLAIT"" -> P,L,A,I,T? But we have A at position4? So ""PLAIT"" would be P,L,A,I,T -> positions: A in position3? But we know A must be at position4? 
      ""BLEAT"" -> B,L,E,A,T? E absent? 
      ""FLATT"" -> not valid?
      ""CLAMP"" -> C absent? 
      How about ""BALAT""? Not a word? 

  We need common words? 

  Another idea: words ending with ""AT"": 
      Commonly, ""PLANT"" -> but N absent? 
      ""GRANT"" -> R absent? 
      ""BOAST"" -> S absent? 
      ""BLAST"" -> S absent? 

  Since we know A is in position4 and T in position5? 

  Let's list common words: 
      ""WHEAT"": E absent? 
      ""TREAT"": R absent? 
      ""MELAT""? Not English? 
      ""OPIAT""? Not common? 
      Perhaps ""DELTA"" -> but E absent? and position? 

  But note: we have L? 

  Possible: 
      If L at position1: L? ? A T
      Example: ""DELFT"" -> but D absent? 
      Or ""COAST"" -> C and S absent? 

  What about words like ""QUART"" -> Q,U,A,R,T? 
      U is absent? R absent? 

  We must avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? 

  Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z? 

  So let's try to form a word: 
      Pattern: [L?] [?] [?] A T

      Possibility 1: L _ _ A T -> words: 
          ""LEAST"" -> E,S absent? And S is absent? 
          ""LOVAT""? Not common? 
          ""LIART""? Not English? 
          Perhaps ""LIGHT"" -> but A? The word must have A at position4? 
          Wait, we know position4 is A? So the word must have A at position4? 

      More promising pattern: without L at position1? 

      Possibility 2: L at position2: pattern: _ L _ A T

      Then: words: 
        ""PLANT""-> P,L,A,N,T -> N absent? 
        ""SLANT""-> S,L,A,N,T -> S and N absent? 
        ""ALERT""-> A,L,E,R,T -> E and R absent? 
        ""FLOAT""-> F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5) -> 
          But we have A at position4? Yes? 
          Check absent: F, O? F not excluded? O not excluded? 
          And T is confirmed? 
          Also, L at position2? Is that allowed? 
          But from constraints: L cannot be in position3 or4? Position2 is allowed? 

          Also, we have to double-check: 
            For A: in ""float"", A is at position4? That matches our deduction? 
            For L: is it in position2? We haven't tested position2? So possible? 

          But note: in the feedback for ""salty"", we tried L in position3? So we don't have feedback on position2? 

          Therefore, ""FLOAT"" seems possible? 

        Is ""FLOAT"" valid? Yes? 

        We also know: from adult, D and U are absent? It doesn't use them? 

        So we can guess ""float""? 

      But wait: we have L at position2? And it must be? Because if L is in the word? And cannot be at 3 or 4? so only 1 or 2? 

      We haven't tested L at position1? But we can do? Let's see: 

      If we put L at position2: 
          Pattern: ? L ? A T

      Now, we need a letter at position1? We haven't tested? So F is new? 

      Also, position3? O is new? 

      So guess ""float"" might work? 

      But note: in ""float"", we have O? 

      We haven't tested O? 

      Also, we might get feedback for position? 

      However, there might be other words? 

      Alternative: if we put L at position1? 

      Pattern: L ? ? A T

      What words: 
        ""LIMIT"" -> but I,A and A not at4? 
        ""LOBAT""? Not valid? 
        ""LOBOT""? Not? 
        ""LEACH"" -> E absent? 
        ""LEMAN"" -> E absent? 
        ""LIBRA"" -> but T? 

      Found? ""LIGHT"" -> G,H,T at end? But T? Position5 is T? So ""LIGAT""? Not valid? 

      How about ""LOGAT"" -> not word? 

      Another possibility: ""MELAT"" -> not? 

      ""VALID"" -> but D absent? From ""adult"" feedback? 

      Therefore, it's hard to find a word with L at position1? 

      So perhaps L is at position2? 

      So we'll go with ""FLOAT""

      But note: in ""FLOAT"", we place:
          Position1: F
          Position2: L
          Position3: O
          Position4: A
          Position5: T

      We know T at5 is correct? A at4 we think is correct? 

      But let's validate the feedback we would get? 

      Also, we know from constraints: 
        A not at1,2,3 -> at4? 
        L not at3,4 -> at2? 
        T not at4 -> it's at5? 

      So it fits? 

      Also, absent? F,O? They aren't excluded? 

      Therefore, we guess ""FLOAT""

<guess>float</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word has T in position 5** (T(✓) from ""adult"").
- **A must be in position 4** (because it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 from previous guesses, and position 5 is T).
- **L must be in position 1 or 2** (cannot be in positions 3 or 4 from previous guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U.
- **Remaining letters**: Must be valid 5-letter English word containing A, L, T, with positions: `? ? ? A T`.

### Analysis:
- **Pattern rules**:  
  - Position 4: A (fixed)  
  - Position 5: T (fixed)  
  - Position 3: Must avoid L (L can only be in position 1 or 2) and avoid excluded letters.
- **Valid pattern**: `? L ? A T` is more viable than `L ? ? A T` due to common English words.
- **Best fit: ""FLOAT""**:  
  - F: Position 1 (untested letter)  
  - L: Position 2 (allowed, not tested here before)  
  - O: Position 3 (untested letter)  
  - A: Position 4 (correct placement)  
  - T: Position 5 (confirmed)  
- Avoids excluded letters (F, O accepted), meets position constraints, and tests two new letters.

<guess>float</guess>",float,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word, not in position 3; and C,R,N,E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning: A, L, T are in the word. But:
  - A not in position 2
  - L not in position 3
  - T not in position 4
And S,Y are absent.

Guess 3: adult -> A(-), D(x), U(x), L(-), T(✓)
Meaning:
  - A: not in position 1 (because we placed A in position 1 and got '-')
  - D: absent
  - U: absent
  - L: not in position 4 (since placed at 4 and got '-')
  - T: correct in position 5! So we know T is the last letter.

Therefore, the secret word has T in position 5: _ _ _ _ T

Also known:
- Letters in the word: A, L, T (and possibly others)
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U
- Position constraints:
  A: cannot be in position 1 (from adult), position 2 (from salty), or position 3 (from crane). 
    Therefore, the only possibility for A is position 4? Because position 5 is T, so A can't be there.
    But positions: 1,2,3 are all forbidden? Then only position 4 remains? 
    However, we also have L to place? 

Wait: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the first four letters? Position 5 is T.

A cannot be in:
  - Position 1: from adult (A(-))
  - Position 2: from salty (A(-))
  - Position 3: from crane (A(-))

Therefore, the only position left for A is position 4? 

But position 4: so the word would be: _ _ _ A L? No, position 5 is T? So _ _ _ A T?

We know L is in the word? But we only have one L? 

Also, from adult: we have L in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 
But now we are placing A in position 4? So L must be elsewhere? 

So secret word: positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:?, 4:A, 5:T? Wait, but we just concluded A must be in position 4? Let me confirm.

Available positions for A: only position 4? Because:
  Position 1: adult gave A(-) -> not at 1.
  Position 2: salty gave A(-) -> not at 2.
  Position 3: crane gave A(-) -> not at 3.
  Position 4 and 5: 5 is T? So only 4.

Therefore, A must be in position 4: so the word ends with ""AT"": ... A T

But wait: the word is _ _ _ A T? 

Also, we know L is in the word? But where? 

L cannot be in:
  - Position 3: from salty (L was in position 3? Actually, in salty: L was in position 3? Let's see: 
        salty: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> feedback L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? 
  - Also from adult: L was in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 

Therefore, L cannot be in position 3 or 4? 

Positions available for L: 1 or 2? Because positions 1,2,3,4: 
  3 and 4 are forbidden? So L must be in position 1 or 2? 

Also, we have one more letter? We know the word contains only A,L,T? Or there might be another? 

We don't have information about the other letter? We only know A,L,T are present? But guess2: salty had 5 letters? Only A,L,T were marked as present? S and Y absent? 
Similarly, adult: we tested D,U and they were absent? 

Therefore, the word must have exactly three of the letters we know: A,L,T? But wait, five letters? So the other two must be new letters? 

But we have many absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? So many letters are still possible? 

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: T
  Position 1 or 2: L? 
  And the remaining two positions: two new letters? 

Moreover, we must not use absent letters? 

So let the word be: 
  [L?] [?] [?] [A] [T]   OR   [?] [L?] [?] [A] [T]

But we cannot put L in positions 3 or 4? So:
  If L is at position 1: then word: L ? ? A T
  If L is at position 2: then word: ? L ? A T

Now, we know position 3 is unknown? 

Also, we have two unknown letters? 

We want to form a valid word? 

Possible words:
  If L at position1: 
      Words: ""LEAPT"" -> but E is absent? (from absent list) -> cannot.
      ""PLAIT"" -> P,L,A,I,T? But we have A at position4? So ""PLAIT"" would be P,L,A,I,T -> positions: A in position3? But we know A must be at position4? 
      ""BLEAT"" -> B,L,E,A,T? E absent? 
      ""FLATT"" -> not valid?
      ""CLAMP"" -> C absent? 
      How about ""BALAT""? Not a word? 

  We need common words? 

  Another idea: words ending with ""AT"": 
      Commonly, ""PLANT"" -> but N absent? 
      ""GRANT"" -> R absent? 
      ""BOAST"" -> S absent? 
      ""BLAST"" -> S absent? 

  Since we know A is in position4 and T in position5? 

  Let's list common words: 
      ""WHEAT"": E absent? 
      ""TREAT"": R absent? 
      ""MELAT""? Not English? 
      ""OPIAT""? Not common? 
      Perhaps ""DELTA"" -> but E absent? and position? 

  But note: we have L? 

  Possible: 
      If L at position1: L? ? A T
      Example: ""DELFT"" -> but D absent? 
      Or ""COAST"" -> C and S absent? 

  What about words like ""QUART"" -> Q,U,A,R,T? 
      U is absent? R absent? 

  We must avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? 

  Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z? 

  So let's try to form a word: 
      Pattern: [L?] [?] [?] A T

      Possibility 1: L _ _ A T -> words: 
          ""LEAST"" -> E,S absent? And S is absent? 
          ""LOVAT""? Not common? 
          ""LIART""? Not English? 
          Perhaps ""LIGHT"" -> but A? The word must have A at position4? 
          Wait, we know position4 is A? So the word must have A at position4? 

      More promising pattern: without L at position1? 

      Possibility 2: L at position2: pattern: _ L _ A T

      Then: words: 
        ""PLANT""-> P,L,A,N,T -> N absent? 
        ""SLANT""-> S,L,A,N,T -> S and N absent? 
        ""ALERT""-> A,L,E,R,T -> E and R absent? 
        ""FLOAT""-> F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5) -> 
          But we have A at position4? Yes? 
          Check absent: F, O? F not excluded? O not excluded? 
          And T is confirmed? 
          Also, L at position2? Is that allowed? 
          But from constraints: L cannot be in position3 or4? Position2 is allowed? 

          Also, we have to double-check: 
            For A: in ""float"", A is at position4? That matches our deduction? 
            For L: is it in position2? We haven't tested position2? So possible? 

          But note: in the feedback for ""salty"", we tried L in position3? So we don't have feedback on position2? 

          Therefore, ""FLOAT"" seems possible? 

        Is ""FLOAT"" valid? Yes? 

        We also know: from adult, D and U are absent? It doesn't use them? 

        So we can guess ""float""? 

      But wait: we have L at position2? And it must be? Because if L is in the word? And cannot be at 3 or 4? so only 1 or 2? 

      We haven't tested L at position1? But we can do? Let's see: 

      If we put L at position2: 
          Pattern: ? L ? A T

      Now, we need a letter at position1? We haven't tested? So F is new? 

      Also, position3? O is new? 

      So guess ""float"" might work? 

      But note: in ""float"", we have O? 

      We haven't tested O? 

      Also, we might get feedback for position? 

      However, there might be other words? 

      Alternative: if we put L at position1? 

      Pattern: L ? ? A T

      What words: 
        ""LIMIT"" -> but I,A and A not at4? 
        ""LOBAT""? Not valid? 
        ""LOBOT""? Not? 
        ""LEACH"" -> E absent? 
        ""LEMAN"" -> E absent? 
        ""LIBRA"" -> but T? 

      Found? ""LIGHT"" -> G,H,T at end? But T? Position5 is T? So ""LIGAT""? Not valid? 

      How about ""LOGAT"" -> not word? 

      Another possibility: ""MELAT"" -> not? 

      ""VALID"" -> but D absent? From ""adult"" feedback? 

      Therefore, it's hard to find a word with L at position1? 

      So perhaps L is at position2? 

      So we'll go with ""FLOAT""

      But note: in ""FLOAT"", we place:
          Position1: F
          Position2: L
          Position3: O
          Position4: A
          Position5: T

      We know T at5 is correct? A at4 we think is correct? 

      But let's validate the feedback we would get? 

      Also, we know from constraints: 
        A not at1,2,3 -> at4? 
        L not at3,4 -> at2? 
        T not at4 -> it's at5? 

      So it fits? 

      Also, absent? F,O? They aren't excluded? 

      Therefore, we guess ""FLOAT""

<guess>float</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word has T in position 5** (T(✓) from ""adult"").
- **A must be in position 4** (because it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 from previous guesses, and position 5 is T).
- **L must be in position 1 or 2** (cannot be in positions 3 or 4 from previous guesses).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. 
 Some popular starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"", ""STARE"", etc.

 I choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: x -> not in the word
 A: - -> present, but not in the 3rd position
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, the secret word contains the letter 'A', but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 We know:
 - The word has 5 letters.
 - It includes 'A' (somewhere except position 3).
 - It does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since many words contain 'S', 'T', and other common letters, we can choose a word that avoids the excluded letters and places 'A' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'A': 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

 We also want to test new common letters to gather more information.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not use C, R, N, E (excluded).
 - Contains 'A', but not in the 3rd position.
 - Includes other common letters such as S, T, B, D, G, etc.

 Examples: 
   We can try words like: ""SALAD"", ""PASTA"", ""MANGO"" -> but note:
      MANGO: M is not excluded? We haven't eliminated M yet. But wait, our feedback says:
          C, R, N, E are out. So N is excluded, but M is allowed? However, we see ""crane"" had N: x, so no N.
      Let's avoid N.

 Actually, from feedback: N is excluded so we can't use N.

 So ""MANGO"" is invalid because of N? Also, we must avoid C,R,N,E.

 Another idea: Consider ""STAND"". But let's check:
   S, T, A, N, D -> N is excluded? Yes, because in ""crane"" N was x -> so no.

 We need a word without C, R, N, E and with 'A' not in the 3rd.

 How about ""PASTA"":
   P, A, S, T, A -> but note, word must be 5 letters? And we have two A's? The word ""pasta"" has two A's? 
   Actually, ""pasta"" has 5 letters: P-A-S-T-A.

 But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we can try.

 But let's see the feedback rules: 
   If we guess a letter that appears multiple times in the guess, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? 
   However, we don't have that information yet.

 Alternatively, try ""PLAIT"": 
   P, L, A, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E, and A is in the 3rd? We want A not in 3rd? Wait, in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. 
   So placing A in position 3 again would be unwise because we know it's not there? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, we will get another '-' unless it is actually in the 3rd? But we know it's not, so we shouldn't place A in the 3rd.

 Therefore, for our next word, let's put 'A' in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 Another word: ""SAULT"" (if valid) or ""SALTY"".

 Let's consider common words: 
   ""SALAD"": has two A's? And D is not excluded? But we have: S, A, L, A, D -> but N and E are excluded? That's fine? But R and C are excluded too? This word avoids them.

 However, let's check: 
   First letter S: not tested -> test it.
   A: now in position 2 -> different from the first time.
   L: new.
   D: new.

 But we also have another A at the end? Actually, ""salad"" has 5 letters: S-A-L-A-D -> so position: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAID"": 
   S, T, A, I, D -> avoids excluded letters: no C, R, N, E? 
   Also, A is in position 3? But we know from last time that A is not in position 3? 
   So we should avoid putting A in position 3.

 Therefore, let's pick a word with A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me list:
   Position 1: A _ _ _ _
   Examples: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""AGENT"" -> but ""ABOUT"": has O (not excluded), U (not excluded), T (good). But we also want to test new letters.
   However, we must exclude C,R,N,E -> so ""about"" is okay? Does it have excluded? No.

   But we also want to cover more common consonants.

 Another word: ""STALE"" -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded? From ""crane"": E was x -> so E is not in the word. So avoid E.

 Therefore, ""STALE"" is not allowed? Because E is present.

 So: 
   Avoid: C, R, N, E.

 What about letters: S, T, L are good? We haven't tested them.

 Another idea: ""AISLE"" -> also has E? Excluded.

 Let me think of words that avoid C,R,N,E and have A? 

   Common words: 
     ""PLAIT"" -> has I and T? But A is in position 3? We should avoid that.

   ""ALTAR"": 
      Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:T, 4:A, 5:R -> R is excluded? Yes! So we cannot use R.

   ""ADAPT"": 
      A, D, A, P, T -> avoid: C,R,N,E? It does avoid? 
      Position: A at 1 and 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for A? Actually, we are not sure if the word can have A at multiple positions? 
      However, note: we know that A is in the word, so if we put A in position 3 we'll get '-' again? We don't want to waste a position? 

      But if the word has two A's, then we might get two '-'? 

   However, let's focus on getting more information.

   I propose ""PASTA"": 
        P, A, S, T, A -> 
        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? 

        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? 

        Also, we test P, S, T.

   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: 
        The feedback for each letter: 
          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -
          Else: x

        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get '-' and the other 'x'. 

   That's okay? We can get information.

   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? 

   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   Look for a word: 
        Start with S? because S is very common? 

   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? 
        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? 

   ""SALTY"": 
        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? 
        A is in position 2? 

        This avoids C,R,N,E? 

   Let's choose ""SALTY"". 

   Why not? 

   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. 

   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.

   We know A isn't the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.

   It also tests L and T? We haven't tested L or T before.

   That seems good.

 So, next guess: ""SALTY""

<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  
- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  
- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  

For the next guess:  
- Must exclude C, R, N, E  
- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  
- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  

The word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  
- Contains A in position 2  
- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  
- No C, R, N, E  
- Valid English word

<guess>salty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning:
- S and Y are not in the word.
- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? 
  Let's see the positions:
  In ""salty"":
    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)
    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)
    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)
    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)
    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)

So overall, we know:
- The word contains the letters: A, L, T
- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y
- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

Also, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.

We need to use this information to form a new guess.

Requirements:
- Must include A, L, T (they are present)
- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)
- Must be a valid English word.

Additionally, we have information about incorrect positions:
For A:
  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? 
  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.

For L:
  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got '-'. 
  But L could be in other positions? 

For T:
  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got '-'.

Also, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters? But we know it's 5 letters.

We don't know what the remaining two letters are? We must try to include two new letters that aren't excluded.

Excluded: C, R, N, E, S, Y
So remaining letters? Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? 

Note: We cannot use the excluded ones.

Moreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? 

Let me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? 

Available letters: almost the rest? But let's list common? 
B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? 

We also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.

Consider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Case 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _

Case 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _

Case 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A

Also, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

We might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.

But note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get '-'? Similarly for L and T? 

We also have limited guesses? Let's think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? 

Example: 
Let me try position 1: A _ _ _ _
Now we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? 
Also, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? 
Similarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?

Possible word: 
  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? 

So if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? 
But we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? 

What letters for the other positions? And we must include common? 

Possible words: 
  ""ALBAT"" -> but that's not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? 
  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? 

""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.

""ALOFT"": 
   A, L, O, F, T -> 
   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T
   Now check restrictions:
      A in pos1 -> allowed.
      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? 
      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? 
      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? 

   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? 
      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it's in pos2? Which we don't know? That's fine? 
      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That's different.

   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? 

   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? 

   However, let's see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? 

   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? 

   So let's try ""aloft"".

But wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? 

Another possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _
We need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That's taken by A.

So T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that's fine.

For example: 
   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? 
   Word: L T ? A ?
   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? 

Another: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? 

Actually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:

Possible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.

To make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? 

But note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? 

Alternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? 

List: 
   ""basalt"" too long? 
   ""metal"" -> too short? 
   ""plate"" -> E excluded? 
   ""slant"" -> S excluded? 
   ""latch"" -> C excluded? 
   ""delta"" -> E excluded? 
   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? 

Actually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? 
Because in ""salty"" we tried position2? 

Similarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.

""alto"": too short? 

""malt"": too short? 

""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? 

Maybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A
We need to put L and T? 

Word: ... A? 
Example: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> 
   But A in position5? 
   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A
   Check restrictions: 
      A: position5? okay? 
      L: position2? okay? 
      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? 
      So if we put T in position4, we would get a '-'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? 
      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? 
      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got '-'. 
      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? 
      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? 

We must avoid putting T in position4? 

So back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": 
   Positions: 
      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5
   Check:
      A in position1 -> okay? 
      L in position2 -> we haven't tried? Maybe okay? 
      T in position5 -> okay? 
      Also, T not in position4? 
      L not in position3? 

   So the positions we are testing: 
      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? 
      L:2 -> might be? 
      O:3 -> new
      F:4 -> new
      T:5 -> ✓ or ? 

   This seems valid? 

But note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven't tested position2? 

But the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn't been tested? 

Also, what other words? 

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? 

""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? 

""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? 

""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> 
   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". 
   So cannot put A in position2? 

""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? 

So perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see if there's a word that avoids using F and O? 

Maybe ""ADULT"": 
   A,D,U,L,T -> 
   Positions: 
      A:1 -> okay? 
      D:2 -> new
      U:3 -> new
      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? 
      T:5 -> okay? 
   But does it include all? A,L,T? 

   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? 

   Word: ""ADULT""

   Now, positions:
      A at1: okay? 
      L at4: okay? 
      T at5: okay? 

   Also, this word tests U and D? 

   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?

Since we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? 

But note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? 

But we have to decide? 

Also, ""adult"": 
   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? 
   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? 

   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven't tried L in position4? 

So both words are valid? 

However, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? 

Another word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? 

I think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: 
   A at position1? okay? 
   L at position4? and we know L is present? 
   T at position5? and we know T is present? 

And the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was '-' meaning it's present but not in the guessed positions? 
In both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? 

Similarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? 

So guess ""adult"".

But let me check: 

   Guess: adult
   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T

   We expect that:
      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? 
      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? 
      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? 
      Also, we test D and U? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? 

So avoid? 

Another: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? 
   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O

   But here: 
      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got '-'. 
      So we cannot put A in position2? 

Hence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? 

Another word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? 

So I choose ""adult""? 

But consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? 
And avoids excluded? 

Therefore, I guess ""adult"".

If we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? 

But note: we haven't ruled out all? 

We can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? 

So ""adult"" it is.

<guess>adult</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3). Excludes C, R, N, E.

- **Guess 2: salty**  
  Feedback: S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x) → Reveals A, L, T are present, but A not in position 2, L not in position 3, T not in position 4. Excludes S, Y.

**Summary of known constraints:**
1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  
2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  
3. **Position rules**:  
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  
   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  
   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  

This narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5. The new guess must include A, L, T and two additional letters not in the excluded list. Valid letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Reasoning for the next guess:
- **Goal**: Prioritize placing A in position 1 (untested position) to efficiently verify if it's correct, while avoiding invalid positions for L and T.  
- **Chosen word: adult**  
  - A in position 1 → Tests possible position for A (position 1).  
  - L in position 4 → Avoids position 3 (invalid for L).  
  - T in position 5 → Avoids position 4 (invalid for T).  
  - New letters tested: D (position 2), U (position 3).  
- **Why ""adult""?**  
  - Fits all constraints: Contains A, L, T; excludes C, R, N, E, S, Y.  
  - Tests new common letters (D, U) for faster deduction.  
  - Avoids repeating known invalid positions for A/L/T.

<guess>adult</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: adult -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) U(x) L(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: A is in the word, not in position 3; and C,R,N,E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)
Meaning: A, L, T are in the word. But:
  - A not in position 2
  - L not in position 3
  - T not in position 4
And S,Y are absent.

Guess 3: adult -> A(-), D(x), U(x), L(-), T(✓)
Meaning:
  - A: not in position 1 (because we placed A in position 1 and got '-')
  - D: absent
  - U: absent
  - L: not in position 4 (since placed at 4 and got '-')
  - T: correct in position 5! So we know T is the last letter.

Therefore, the secret word has T in position 5: _ _ _ _ T

Also known:
- Letters in the word: A, L, T (and possibly others)
- Absent letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U
- Position constraints:
  A: cannot be in position 1 (from adult), position 2 (from salty), or position 3 (from crane). 
    Therefore, the only possibility for A is position 4? Because position 5 is T, so A can't be there.
    But positions: 1,2,3 are all forbidden? Then only position 4 remains? 
    However, we also have L to place? 

Wait: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the first four letters? Position 5 is T.

A cannot be in:
  - Position 1: from adult (A(-))
  - Position 2: from salty (A(-))
  - Position 3: from crane (A(-))

Therefore, the only position left for A is position 4? 

But position 4: so the word would be: _ _ _ A L? No, position 5 is T? So _ _ _ A T?

We know L is in the word? But we only have one L? 

Also, from adult: we have L in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 
But now we are placing A in position 4? So L must be elsewhere? 

So secret word: positions: 1:?, 2:?, 3:?, 4:A, 5:T? Wait, but we just concluded A must be in position 4? Let me confirm.

Available positions for A: only position 4? Because:
  Position 1: adult gave A(-) -> not at 1.
  Position 2: salty gave A(-) -> not at 2.
  Position 3: crane gave A(-) -> not at 3.
  Position 4 and 5: 5 is T? So only 4.

Therefore, A must be in position 4: so the word ends with ""AT"": ... A T

But wait: the word is _ _ _ A T? 

Also, we know L is in the word? But where? 

L cannot be in:
  - Position 3: from salty (L was in position 3? Actually, in salty: L was in position 3? Let's see: 
        salty: S(1), A(2), L(3), T(4), Y(5) -> feedback L(-) meaning L is in the word but not at position 3? 
  - Also from adult: L was in position 4? And we got L(-) meaning L is not in position 4? 

Therefore, L cannot be in position 3 or 4? 

Positions available for L: 1 or 2? Because positions 1,2,3,4: 
  3 and 4 are forbidden? So L must be in position 1 or 2? 

Also, we have one more letter? We know the word contains only A,L,T? Or there might be another? 

We don't have information about the other letter? We only know A,L,T are present? But guess2: salty had 5 letters? Only A,L,T were marked as present? S and Y absent? 
Similarly, adult: we tested D,U and they were absent? 

Therefore, the word must have exactly three of the letters we know: A,L,T? But wait, five letters? So the other two must be new letters? 

But we have many absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? So many letters are still possible? 

Therefore, the secret word has:
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: T
  Position 1 or 2: L? 
  And the remaining two positions: two new letters? 

Moreover, we must not use absent letters? 

So let the word be: 
  [L?] [?] [?] [A] [T]   OR   [?] [L?] [?] [A] [T]

But we cannot put L in positions 3 or 4? So:
  If L is at position 1: then word: L ? ? A T
  If L is at position 2: then word: ? L ? A T

Now, we know position 3 is unknown? 

Also, we have two unknown letters? 

We want to form a valid word? 

Possible words:
  If L at position1: 
      Words: ""LEAPT"" -> but E is absent? (from absent list) -> cannot.
      ""PLAIT"" -> P,L,A,I,T? But we have A at position4? So ""PLAIT"" would be P,L,A,I,T -> positions: A in position3? But we know A must be at position4? 
      ""BLEAT"" -> B,L,E,A,T? E absent? 
      ""FLATT"" -> not valid?
      ""CLAMP"" -> C absent? 
      How about ""BALAT""? Not a word? 

  We need common words? 

  Another idea: words ending with ""AT"": 
      Commonly, ""PLANT"" -> but N absent? 
      ""GRANT"" -> R absent? 
      ""BOAST"" -> S absent? 
      ""BLAST"" -> S absent? 

  Since we know A is in position4 and T in position5? 

  Let's list common words: 
      ""WHEAT"": E absent? 
      ""TREAT"": R absent? 
      ""MELAT""? Not English? 
      ""OPIAT""? Not common? 
      Perhaps ""DELTA"" -> but E absent? and position? 

  But note: we have L? 

  Possible: 
      If L at position1: L? ? A T
      Example: ""DELFT"" -> but D absent? 
      Or ""COAST"" -> C and S absent? 

  What about words like ""QUART"" -> Q,U,A,R,T? 
      U is absent? R absent? 

  We must avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? 

  Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z? 

  So let's try to form a word: 
      Pattern: [L?] [?] [?] A T

      Possibility 1: L _ _ A T -> words: 
          ""LEAST"" -> E,S absent? And S is absent? 
          ""LOVAT""? Not common? 
          ""LIART""? Not English? 
          Perhaps ""LIGHT"" -> but A? The word must have A at position4? 
          Wait, we know position4 is A? So the word must have A at position4? 

      More promising pattern: without L at position1? 

      Possibility 2: L at position2: pattern: _ L _ A T

      Then: words: 
        ""PLANT""-> P,L,A,N,T -> N absent? 
        ""SLANT""-> S,L,A,N,T -> S and N absent? 
        ""ALERT""-> A,L,E,R,T -> E and R absent? 
        ""FLOAT""-> F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), A(4), T(5) -> 
          But we have A at position4? Yes? 
          Check absent: F, O? F not excluded? O not excluded? 
          And T is confirmed? 
          Also, L at position2? Is that allowed? 
          But from constraints: L cannot be in position3 or4? Position2 is allowed? 

          Also, we have to double-check: 
            For A: in ""float"", A is at position4? That matches our deduction? 
            For L: is it in position2? We haven't tested position2? So possible? 

          But note: in the feedback for ""salty"", we tried L in position3? So we don't have feedback on position2? 

          Therefore, ""FLOAT"" seems possible? 

        Is ""FLOAT"" valid? Yes? 

        We also know: from adult, D and U are absent? It doesn't use them? 

        So we can guess ""float""? 

      But wait: we have L at position2? And it must be? Because if L is in the word? And cannot be at 3 or 4? so only 1 or 2? 

      We haven't tested L at position1? But we can do? Let's see: 

      If we put L at position2: 
          Pattern: ? L ? A T

      Now, we need a letter at position1? We haven't tested? So F is new? 

      Also, position3? O is new? 

      So guess ""float"" might work? 

      But note: in ""float"", we have O? 

      We haven't tested O? 

      Also, we might get feedback for position? 

      However, there might be other words? 

      Alternative: if we put L at position1? 

      Pattern: L ? ? A T

      What words: 
        ""LIMIT"" -> but I,A and A not at4? 
        ""LOBAT""? Not valid? 
        ""LOBOT""? Not? 
        ""LEACH"" -> E absent? 
        ""LEMAN"" -> E absent? 
        ""LIBRA"" -> but T? 

      Found? ""LIGHT"" -> G,H,T at end? But T? Position5 is T? So ""LIGAT""? Not valid? 

      How about ""LOGAT"" -> not word? 

      Another possibility: ""MELAT"" -> not? 

      ""VALID"" -> but D absent? From ""adult"" feedback? 

      Therefore, it's hard to find a word with L at position1? 

      So perhaps L is at position2? 

      So we'll go with ""FLOAT""

      But note: in ""FLOAT"", we place:
          Position1: F
          Position2: L
          Position3: O
          Position4: A
          Position5: T

      We know T at5 is correct? A at4 we think is correct? 

      But let's validate the feedback we would get? 

      Also, we know from constraints: 
        A not at1,2,3 -> at4? 
        L not at3,4 -> at2? 
        T not at4 -> it's at5? 

      So it fits? 

      Also, absent? F,O? They aren't excluded? 

      Therefore, we guess ""FLOAT""

<guess>float</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Secret word has T in position 5** (T(✓) from ""adult"").
- **A must be in position 4** (because it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 from previous guesses, and position 5 is T).
- **L must be in position 1 or 2** (cannot be in positions 3 or 4 from previous guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U.
- **Remaining letters**: Must be valid 5-letter English word containing A, L, T, with positions: `? ? ? A T`.

### Analysis:
- **Pattern rules**:  
  - Position 4: A (fixed)  
  - Position 5: T (fixed)  
  - Position 3: Must avoid L (L can only be in position 1 or 2) and avoid excluded letters.
- **Valid pattern**: `? L ? A T` is more viable than `L ? ? A T` due to common English words.
- **Best fit: ""FLOAT""**:  
  - F: Position 1 (untested letter)  
  - L: Position 2 (allowed, not tested here before)  
  - O: Position 3 (untested letter)  
  - A: Position 4 (correct placement)  
  - T: Position 5 (confirmed)  
- Avoids excluded letters (F, O accepted), meets position constraints, and tests two new letters.

We haven\'t eliminated M yet. But wait, our feedback says:\n          C, R, N, E are out. So N is excluded, but M is allowed? However, we see ""crane"" had N: x, so no N.\n      Let\'s avoid N.\n\n Actually, from feedback: N is excluded so we can\'t use N.\n\n So ""MANGO"" is invalid because of N? Also, we must avoid C,R,N,E.\n\n Another idea: Consider ""STAND"". But let\'s check:\n   S, T, A, N, D -> N is excluded? Yes, because in ""crane"" N was x -> so no.\n\n We need a word without C, R, N, E and with \'A\' not in the 3rd.\n\n How about ""PASTA"":\n   P, A, S, T, A -> but note, word must be 5 letters? And we have two A\'s? The word ""pasta"" has two A\'s? \n   Actually, ""pasta"" has 5 letters: P-A-S-T-A.\n\n But we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we can try.\n\n But let\'s see the feedback rules: \n   If we guess a letter that appears multiple times in the guess, the feedback might mark one as correct and the other as absent? \n   However, we don\'t have that information yet.\n\n Alternatively, try ""PLAIT"": \n   P, L, A, I, T -> avoids C,R,N,E, and A is in the 3rd? We want A not in 3rd? Wait, in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in that position. \n   So placing A in position 3 again would be unwise because we know it\'s not there? Actually, if we put A in position 3 again, we will get another \'-\' unless it is actually in the 3rd? But we know it\'s not, so we shouldn\'t place A in the 3rd.\n\n Therefore, for our next word, let\'s put \'A\' in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\n Another word: ""SAULT"" (if valid) or ""SALTY"".\n\n Let\'s consider common words: \n   ""SALAD"": has two A\'s? And D is not excluded? But we have: S, A, L, A, D -> but N and E are excluded? That\'s fine? But R and C are excluded too? This word avoids them.\n\n However, let\'s check: \n   First letter S: not tested -> test it.\n   A: now in position 2 -> different from the first time.\n   L: new.\n   D: new.\n\n But we also have another A at the end? Actually, ""salad"" has 5 letters: S-A-L-A-D -> so position: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STAID"": \n   S, T, A, I, D -> avoids excluded letters: no C, R, N, E? \n   Also, A is in position 3? But we know from last time that A is not in position 3? \n   So we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n Therefore, let\'s pick a word with A in either position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me list:\n   Position 1: A _ _ _ _\n   Examples: ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""AGENT"" -> but ""ABOUT"": has O (not excluded), U (not excluded), T (good). But we also want to test new letters.\n   However, we must exclude C,R,N,E -> so ""about"" is okay? Does it have excluded? No.\n\n   But we also want to cover more common consonants.\n\n Another word: ""STALE"" -> but E is excluded? Yes, E is excluded? From ""crane"": E was x -> so E is not in the word. So avoid E.\n\n Therefore, ""STALE"" is not allowed? Because E is present.\n\n So: \n   Avoid: C, R, N, E.\n\n What about letters: S, T, L are good? We haven\'t tested them.\n\n Another idea: ""AISLE"" -> also has E? Excluded.\n\n Let me think of words that avoid C,R,N,E and have A? \n\n   Common words: \n     ""PLAIT"" -> has I and T? But A is in position 3? We should avoid that.\n\n   ""ALTAR"": \n      Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:T, 4:A, 5:R -> R is excluded? Yes! So we cannot use R.\n\n   ""ADAPT"": \n      A, D, A, P, T -> avoid: C,R,N,E? It does avoid? \n      Position: A at 1 and 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for A? Actually, we are not sure if the word can have A at multiple positions? \n      However, note: we know that A is in the word, so if we put A in position 3 we\'ll get \'-\' again? We don\'t want to waste a position? \n\n      But if the word has two A\'s, then we might get two \'-\'? \n\n   However, let\'s focus on getting more information.\n\n   I propose ""PASTA"": \n        P, A, S, T, A -> \n        Avoids excluded: no C,R,N,E? Yes? \n\n        Positions: A is at 2 and 5? That means we test two positions? \n\n        Also, we test P, S, T.\n\n   But note: if the word has only one A and we guess two, then one A might be marked as not present? Actually, the rule: \n        The feedback for each letter: \n          If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓\n          Else, if the letter is in the word but not that position: -\n          Else: x\n\n        And also, if you guess a duplicate, it might be that the word has only one A? Then one will get \'-\' and the other \'x\'. \n\n   That\'s okay? We can get information.\n\n   Alternatively, we might choose a word without duplicate letters? \n\n   How about ""PLATY""? Not common? Or ""DATAL""? Not a word.\n\n   Look for a word: \n        Start with S? because S is very common? \n\n   ""SATAY"": a word? If allowed? \n        S, A, T, A, Y -> but duplicate A? \n\n   ""SALTY"": \n        S, A, L, T, Y -> unique letters? \n        A is in position 2? \n\n        This avoids C,R,N,E? \n\n   Let\'s choose ""SALTY"". \n\n   Why not? \n\n   We test: S, A, L, T, Y. \n\n   Position 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:Y.\n\n   We know A isn\'t the 3rd? Now we are testing A in the second.\n\n   It also tests L and T? We haven\'t tested L or T before.\n\n   That seems good.\n\n So, next guess: ""SALTY""\n\n<guess>salty</guess>After analyzing the feedback from ""crane"":  \n- C, R, N, E are **absent** (x)  \n- A is **present** (-) but not in position 3  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must exclude C, R, N, E  \n- Include A in a position other than 3 (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  \n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters like S, T, L, Y  \n- Avoid duplicate letters for clearer feedback  \n\nThe word **""SALTY""** fits these conditions:  \n- Contains A in position 2  \n- Uses untested consonants S, L, T, Y  \n- No C, R, N, E  \n- Valid English word\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (which was the position in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- S and Y are not in the word.\n- A, L, T are in the word, but not in position 2, 3, and 4 respectively? \n  Let\'s see the positions:\n  In ""salty"":\n    Position 1: S -> x (not in word)\n    Position 2: A -> - (in word, not in position 2)\n    Position 3: L -> - (in word, not in position 3)\n    Position 4: T -> - (in word, not in position 4)\n    Position 5: Y -> x (not in word)\n\nSo overall, we know:\n- The word contains the letters: A, L, T\n- It does not contain: C, R, N, E, S, Y\n- We have 5 letters: [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", we had A not in position 3, and now from ""salty"", A is not in position 2, and L not in position 3, and T not in position 4.\n\nWe need to use this information to form a new guess.\n\nRequirements:\n- Must include A, L, T (they are present)\n- Cannot contain C, R, N, E, S, Y (excluded)\n- Must be a valid English word.\n\nAdditionally, we have information about incorrect positions:\nFor A:\n  Cannot be in position 2 or 3? Actually, from guess1 it was not in position 3, and guess2 not in position 2. So A cannot be in pos2 or pos3? \n  So A must be in pos1, pos4, or pos5.\n\nFor L:\n  We know L is in the word, but not in position 3? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 3 and got \'-\'. \n  But L could be in other positions? \n\nFor T:\n  We know T is in the word, but not in position 4? Because in ""salty"" it was in position 4 and got \'-\'.\n\nAlso, the word must have two other letters? We only have A, L, T? Three letters? So we need two more letters?

Possible? We have many? But we should choose common letters? \n\nNote: We cannot use the excluded ones.\n\nMoreover, we need to place A, L, T? But the word has positions? \n\nLet me think of words that include A, L, T and two other letters that are not excluded? \n\nAvailable letters: almost the rest? But let\'s list common? \nB, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z? \n\nWe also have the position restrictions for A, L, T.\n\nConsider A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nCase 1: A in position 1? Then the word: A _ _ _ _\n\nCase 2: A in position 4? Then: _ _ _ A _\n\nCase 3: A in position 5? Then: _ _ _ _ A\n\nAlso, L cannot be in position 3? T cannot be in position 4? \n\nMoreover, the word must be valid? \n\nWe might also want to test new letters? But we have three known letters? So we can try to use a word that uses A,L,T and two new letters.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word and we put A in a wrong position we get \'-\'? Similarly for L and T? \n\nWe also have limited guesses? Let\'s think of a word that puts A in one of the possible positions? And avoid putting L in position 3? And T in position 4? \n\nExample: \nLet me try position 1: A _ _ _ _\nNow we have to include L and T? So we have A, ?, ?, ?, ? and we need L and T in non-conflicting? \nAlso, L cannot be in pos3? So if we put L in position 2 or 4 or 5? \nSimilarly, T cannot be in position 4? So T in positions 1,2,3,5? But position1 is A? So T in 2,3,5?\n\nPossible word: \n  A _ L T _ -> but that would put L in position3? But we cannot? Because L cannot be in position3? \n\nSo if position1 is A, we might put L in position2? Then word: A L ? ? ? \nBut we need T? We can put T in position5? Then: A L ? ? T? \n\nWhat letters for the other positions? And we must include common? \n\nPossible words: \n  ""ALBAT"" -> but that\'s not 5? ""albat"" is not a word? \n  ""ALERT"" -> but E is excluded? \n\n""ALTER"" -> E excluded? No.\n\n""ALOFT"": \n   A, L, O, F, T -> \n   Positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:O, 4:F, 5:T\n   Now check restrictions:\n      A in pos1 -> allowed.\n      L in pos2 -> we have no feedback on pos2 for L? So possible? \n      T in pos5 -> allowed? Because T cannot only be in pos4? So pos5 is OK? \n      Also, we avoid excluded? O and F are not excluded? \n\n   But we must see if L and T are in positions they are allowed? \n      For L: we know it cannot be in position 3? But in ""salty"" we had it in pos3? Now in ""aloft"" it\'s in pos2? Which we don\'t know? That\'s fine? \n      For T: in ""salty"" we had T in pos4? Now in pos5? That\'s different.\n\n   Now, in our word, we also test O and F? \n\n   So ""aloft"" seems a valid word? \n\n   However, let\'s see: the word ""aloft"" satisfies all? \n\n   Also, exclude? C,R,N,E,S,Y not present? And we use O,F? \n\n   So let\'s try ""aloft"".\n\nBut wait, what if A is not in position1? Then we might miss? \n\nAnother possibility: A in position4? Then: _ _ _ A _\nWe need to place L and T? Also, avoid L in pos3? and T in pos4? But position4 is A? So T cannot be in position4? That\'s taken by A.\n\nSo T must be in position 1,2,3,5? But not position4? So that\'s fine.\n\nFor example: \n   We might have L at position1? T at position2? And A at position4? And then two other letters? \n   Word: L T ? A ?\n   Possible? ""LTAVA"" not common? \n\nAnother: ""PATIO"" -> P,A,T,I,O? But A is in position2? We know from ""salty"" that A cannot be in position2? So no? \n\nActually, A must be in 1,4,5? So if we consider A at position4? Then:\n\nPossible word: ""THALM"" -> not common.\n\nTo make it easier, perhaps we can try to include A in position4? \n\nBut note: we want to maximize information? We already know three letters? So we might be able to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider words that have the letters A,L,T? \n\nList: \n   ""basalt"" too long? \n   ""metal"" -> too short? \n   ""plate"" -> E excluded? \n   ""slant"" -> S excluded? \n   ""latch"" -> C excluded? \n   ""delta"" -> E excluded? \n   ""fault"" -> but F? Also, U? \n\nActually, ""fault"" has A in position 2? But we cannot because A not in position2? \nBecause in ""salty"" we tried position2? \n\nSimilarly, ""vault"": A in position2? Same.\n\n""alto"": too short? \n\n""malt"": too short? \n\n""exalt"": E and X? E excluded? \n\nMaybe A in position5? Then: _ _ _ _ A\nWe need to put L and T? \n\nWord: ... A? \nExample: ""FLOTA"" -> F,L,O,T,A -> \n   But A in position5? \n   Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:T, 5:A\n   Check restrictions: \n      A: position5? okay? \n      L: position2? okay? \n      T: position4? oh, but from ""salty"", T cannot be in position4? \n      So if we put T in position4, we would get a \'-\'? Because it is in the word? But the feedback would say ""-"" for T? \n      However, we already know T is in the word? But we are testing whether it is in position4? \n      Actually, we know it cannot be in position4? Because ""salty"" put it in position4 and got \'-\'. \n      So that means T is not in position4. Therefore, we must not put T in position4? \n      Therefore, ""FLOTA"" puts T in position4? not allowed? \n\nWe must avoid putting T in position4? \n\nSo back to our idea of ""ALOFT"": \n   Positions: \n      A:1, L:2, O:3, F:4, T:5\n   Check:\n      A in position1 -> okay? \n      L in position2 -> we haven\'t tried? Maybe okay? \n      T in position5 -> okay? \n      Also, T not in position4? \n      L not in position3? \n\n   So the positions we are testing: \n      A:1 -> if we get ✓ or ? \n      L:2 -> might be? \n      O:3 -> new\n      F:4 -> new\n      T:5 -> ✓ or ? \n\n   This seems valid? \n\nBut note: we have L in position2? In ""salty"", we had L in position3? Not? So we haven\'t tested position2? \n\nBut the rule: feedback for L? If the secret word has L in position2, then we get ✓? But it hasn\'t been tested? \n\nAlso, what other words? \n\nAnother word: ""PLAIT"" -> but A in position3? We know A cannot be in position3? \n\n""ALTOS"" -> plural? but S excluded? \n\n""FINAL"" -> but N excluded? \n\n""VALID"" -> V,A,L,I,D -> \n   A in position2? But we cannot? Because position2 for A was already incorrect in ""salty"". \n   So cannot put A in position2? \n\n""LAYIN"" -> Y excluded? \n\nSo perhaps ""aloft"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that avoids using F and O? \n\nMaybe ""ADULT"": \n   A,D,U,L,T -> \n   Positions: \n      A:1 -> okay? \n      D:2 -> new\n      U:3 -> new\n      L:4 -> okay? Because L not in position3? But position4 is new? \n      T:5 -> okay? \n   But does it include all? A,L,T? \n\n   Also, excluded letters? No C,R,N,E,S,Y? \n\n   Word: ""ADULT""\n\n   Now, positions:\n      A at1: okay? \n      L at4: okay? \n      T at5: okay? \n\n   Also, this word tests U and D? \n\n   Which one is better? ""aloft"" or ""adult""?\n\nSince we have more new letters in ""adult"" (D,U) vs ""aloft"" (O,F)? \n\nBut note: we know three letters? We might get some ✓? \n\nBut we have to decide? \n\nAlso, ""adult"": \n   We avoid putting L in position3? And T in position4? \n   However, in ""adult"": L is in position4? and T in position5? This is fine? \n\n   But what about the fact that we know L? We haven\'t tried L in position4? \n\nSo both words are valid? \n\nHowever, perhaps we can consider that we are not expecting L in position3 or T in position4? \n\nAnother word: ""LATTO"" -> not common? \n\nI think ""adult"" is a valid word? But let me confirm: \n   A at position1? okay? \n   L at position4? and we know L is present? \n   T at position5? and we know T is present? \n\nAnd the feedback for A in ""crane"" and ""salty"" was \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in the guessed positions? \nIn both, we never guessed A in position1? So that might be possible? \n\nSimilarly, we never guessed L in position1? or position4? \n\nSo guess ""adult"".\n\nBut let me check: \n\n   Guess: adult\n   Positions: 1:A, 2:D, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T\n\n   We expect that:\n      A might get ✓ if it is in pos1? \n      L might get ✓ if it is in pos4? \n      T might get ✓ if it is in pos5? \n      Also, we test D and U? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TALON"": T,A,L,O,N -> but N excluded? ""t a l o n"" -> N is excluded? \n\nSo avoid? \n\nAnother: ""BALTO"" -> B,A,L,T,O? \n   Positions:1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:T, 5:O\n\n   But here: \n      A is in position2? But we know A cannot be in position2? Because ""salty"" had A in pos2 and got \'-\'. \n      So we cannot put A in position2? \n\nHence, ""adult"" at least has A in position1? \n\nAnother word: ""PLATT"" -> not 5? \n\nSo I choose ""adult""? \n\nBut consider: the word must include A,L,T? adult has A,L,T? \nAnd avoids excluded? \n\nTherefore, I guess ""adult"".\n\nIf we get feedback that A in position1 is correct? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t ruled out all? \n\nWe can also consider ""PLAUD"" -> not common? \n\nSo ""adult"" it is.\n\n<guess>adult</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Reveals A is present (but not in position 3).

Excludes S, Y.\n\n**Summary of known constraints:**\n1. **Present letters**: A, L, T  \n2. **Excluded letters**: C, R, N, E, S, Y  \n3. **Position rules**:  \n   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (based on both guesses).  \n   - L cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2).  \n   - T cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2).  \n\nThis narrows A to positions 1, 4, or 5. The new guess must include A, L, T and two additional letters not in the excluded list. Valid letters include B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\n### Reasoning for the next guess:\n- **Goal**: Prioritize placing A in position 1 (untested position) to efficiently verify if it\'s correct, while avoiding invalid positions for L and T.  \n- **Chosen word: adult**  \n  - A in position 1 → Tests possible position for A (position 1).  \n  - L in position 4 → Avoids position 3 (invalid for L).  \n  - T in position 5 → Avoids position 4 (invalid for T).  \n  - New letters tested: D (position 2), U (position 3).  \n- **Why ""adult""?**  \n  - Fits all constraints: Contains A, L, T; excludes C, R, N, E, S, Y.  \n  - Tests new common letters (D, U) for faster deduction.  \n  - Avoids repeating known invalid positions for A/L/T.\n\n<guess>adult</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: adult -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) U(x) L(-) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning: A is in the word, not in position 3; and C,R,N,E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: salty -> S(x), A(-), L(-), T(-), Y(x)\nMeaning: A, L, T are in the word.

Because position 5 is T, so A can\'t be there.\n    But positions: 1,2,3 are all forbidden? Then only position 4 remains? \n    However, we also have L to place? \n\nWait: positions 1,2,3,4 are for the first four letters? Position 5 is T.\n\nA cannot be in:\n  - Position 1: from adult (A(-))\n  - Position 2: from salty (A(-))\n  - Position 3: from crane (A(-))\n\nTherefore, the only position left for A is position 4? \n\nBut position 4: so the word would be: _ _ _ A L? No, position 5 is T? So _ _ _ A T?\n\nWe know L is in the word? But we only have one L? \n\nAlso, from adult: we have L in position 4?

Wait, but we just concluded A must be in position 4? Let me confirm.\n\nAvailable positions for A: only position 4? Because:\n  Position 1: adult gave A(-) -> not at 1.\n  Position 2: salty gave A(-) -> not at 2.\n  Position 3: crane gave A(-) -> not at 3.\n  Position 4 and 5: 5 is T?

So L must be in position 1 or 2? \n\nAlso, we have one more letter? We know the word contains only A,L,T? Or there might be another? \n\nWe don\'t have information about the other letter? We only know A,L,T are present? But guess2: salty had 5 letters? Only A,L,T were marked as present? S and Y absent? \nSimilarly, adult: we tested D,U and they were absent? \n\nTherefore, the word must have exactly three of the letters we know: A,L,T? But wait, five letters? So the other two must be new letters? \n\nBut we have many absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? So many letters are still possible? \n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: T\n  Position 1 or 2: L? \n  And the remaining two positions: two new letters? \n\nMoreover, we must not use absent letters? \n\nSo let the word be: \n  [L?] [?] [?] [A] [T]   OR   [?] [L?] [?] [A] [T]\n\nBut we cannot put L in positions 3 or 4? So:\n  If L is at position 1: then word: L ? ? A T\n  If L is at position 2: then word: ? L ?

R absent? \n\n  We must avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,S,Y,D,U? \n\n  Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z? \n\n  So let\'s try to form a word: \n      Pattern: [L?] [?] [?] A T\n\n      Possibility 1: L _ _ A T -> words: \n          ""LEAST"" -> E,S absent?

Is that allowed? \n          But from constraints: L cannot be in position3 or4? Position2 is allowed? \n\n          Also, we have to double-check: \n            For A: in ""float"", A is at position4? That matches our deduction? \n            For L: is it in position2? We haven\'t tested position2? So possible? \n\n          But note: in the feedback for ""salty"", we tried L in position3? So we don\'t have feedback on position2? \n\n          Therefore, ""FLOAT"" seems possible? \n\n        Is ""FLOAT"" valid? Yes? \n\n        We also know: from adult, D and U are absent? It doesn\'t use them? \n\n        So we can guess ""float""? \n\n      But wait: we have L at position2? And it must be? Because if L is in the word? And cannot be at 3 or 4? so only 1 or 2? \n\n      We haven\'t tested L at position1? But we can do? Let\'s see: \n\n      If we put L at position2: \n          Pattern: ? L ? A T\n\n      Now, we need a letter at position1? We haven\'t tested? So F is new? \n\n      Also, position3? O is new? \n\n      So guess ""float"" might work? \n\n      But note: in ""float"", we have O? \n\n      We haven\'t tested O? \n\n      Also, we might get feedback for position? \n\n      However, there might be other words? \n\n      Alternative: if we put L at position1? \n\n      Pattern: L ? ?

Not? \n        ""LEACH"" -> E absent? \n        ""LEMAN"" -> E absent? \n        ""LIBRA"" -> but T? \n\n      Found? ""LIGHT"" -> G,H,T at end? But T? Position5 is T? So ""LIGAT""?

From ""adult"" feedback? \n\n      Therefore, it\'s hard to find a word with L at position1? \n\n      So perhaps L is at position2? \n\n      So we\'ll go with ""FLOAT""\n\n      But note: in ""FLOAT"", we place:\n          Position1: F\n          Position2: L\n          Position3: O\n          Position4: A\n          Position5: T\n\n      We know T at5 is correct?

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Meaning: A is present but not in position 3; C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: salty -> S(x) A(-) L(-) T(-) Y(x)
Meaning: A, L, T are present but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively; S, Y are absent.

Guess 3: adult -> A(-) D(x) U(x) L(-) T(✓)
Meaning: T is correct in position 5; A is present but not in position 1; L is present but not in position 4; D, U are absent.

Guess 4: float -> F(x) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) T(✓)
Meaning: L is correct in position 2, O is correct in position 3, A is correct in position 4, T is correct in position 5; F is absent.

So, from guess 4, we have:
- Position 2: L (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)
- Position 4: A (correct)
- Position 5: T (correct)

Therefore, the word has the form: _ L O A T

We only need to find the first letter.

We know the following letters are absent: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U, F (from the feedback of all guesses).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the first position: any letter not excluded and not already in the word? But the word has L,O,A,T, so the first letter must be a new letter? Or it could be one of these? But we have them in other positions? But the first position is open.

But note: the word has 5 distinct letters? We don't know? But in this case, we have L,O,A,T in positions 2,3,4,5, so the first letter must be a different letter? Because if it were one of these, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate? But it's possible? 

But let's see: in the feedback, when we guessed ""salty"" (which had two A's? No, ""salty"" has one A? ""salty"" is S-A-L-T-Y, no duplicate. Similarly, ""adult"" has two A's? ""adult"" is A-D-U-L-T, so A and T? But we had A in position1 and T in position5? And we got A(-) and T(✓). But the word might have only one A? 

In ""float"", we have F-L-O-A-T, no duplicate? 

But the secret word might have duplicate? However, in this case, for the first position, if we put a letter that is already in the word, it would be a duplicate? 

But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far? 

Moreover, the feedback for ""adult"": we had A in position1 and A is present? But we got A(-) meaning it's not in position1? But we know A is in the word? So if the word had two A's, we might have gotten one '-' and one '✓'? But in ""float"", we got A(✓) at position4? So the word has at least one A? 

Similarly, for other letters? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But let's first try without duplicate? 

So the first letter must be a letter not in {L,O,A,T} and not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U, F

Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Now, what words are there that start with one of these and end with ""LOAT""? 

Common words: 
  ""BLOAT"" -> B-L-O-A-T
  ""GLOAT"" -> G-L-O-A-T

Also, ""PLOAT""? Not a word? 
""FLOAT"" we already tried? 

So possible: ""BLOAT"" or ""GLOAT""

We haven't tried B or G? 

But we need to guess one? 

We can try ""BLOAT"" first? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Alternatively, we can try ""gloat""? 

But let's see the feedback? 

We know that the word is _LOAT, and we have two candidates? 

But we can guess one? 

Since we have limited guesses? We have 6 tries? This is the 5th? 

But we can try? 

But note: we might get it? 

But let's think: is there any other word? 

""CLOAT""? Not a word? 
""MLOAT""? No? 
""KLOAT""? No? 
""WHOAT""? No? 

So only ""BLOAT"" and ""GLOAT"" are common? 

We can try ""BLOAT"" and if it's not, then ""GLOAT"" next? 

But we have two guesses left? 

But we can also consider: in the feedback, we have no information about B or G? 

So let's try ""BLOAT""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is present (not position 3); C, R, N, E absent.  
- **Guess 2 (salty)**: A, L, T present (A not position 2, L not position 3, T not position 4); S, Y absent.  
- **Guess 3 (adult)**: T is **correct in position 5**; A present (not position 1), L present (not position 4); D, U absent.  
- **Guess 4 (float)**: L **correct in position 2**, O **correct in position 3**, A **correct in position 4**, T **correct in position 5**; F absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 2: **L**  
   - Position 3: **O**  
   - Position 4: **A**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
   - **Word pattern**: `? L O A T` (only position 1 is unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U, F (cannot appear in the word).  

3. **Possible letters for position 1**:  
   - Must be a valid English letter not in `{L, O, A, T}` (no duplicates confirmed yet) and not absent.  
   - **Candidates**: B, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   - **Common words fitting `?LOAT`**:  
     - `BLOAT` (swell or become inflated)  
     - `GLOAT` (dwell on one's success smugly)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Only one position is unknown, so prioritize testing a valid word that fits the pattern.  
- `BLOAT` and `GLOAT` are the most common options.  
- **Guess `BLOAT`** to test `B` in position 1:  
  - If correct, the word is solved.  
  - If incorrect, `GLOAT` is the only other common word (next guess).  

<guess>bloat</guess>",bloat,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Meaning: A, L, T are present but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively; S, Y are absent.

Guess 3: adult -> A(-) D(x) U(x) L(-) T(✓)

Meaning: L is correct in position 2, O is correct in position 3, A is correct in position 4, T is correct in position 5; F is absent.

So, from guess 4, we have:
- Position 2: L (correct)
- Position 3: O (correct)

Therefore, the word has the form: _ L O A T

But let's see: in the feedback, when we guessed ""salty"" (which had two A's? No, ""salty"" has one A? ""salty"" is S-A-L-T-Y, no duplicate. Similarly, ""adult"" has two A's? ""adult"" is A-D-U-L-T, so A and T? But we had A in position1 and T in position5? And we got A(-) and T(✓). But the word might have only one A? 

In ""float"", we have F-L-O-A-T, no duplicate? 

But the secret word might have duplicate? However, in this case, for the first position, if we put a letter that is already in the word, it would be a duplicate? 

But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far? 

Moreover, the feedback for ""adult"": we had A in position1 and A is present? But we got A(-) meaning it's not in position1? But we know A is in the word? So if the word had two A's, we might have gotten one '-' and one '✓'? But in ""float"", we got A(✓) at position4? So the word has at least one A? 

Similarly, for other letters? 

But to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be a duplicate? But let's first try without duplicate? 

So the first letter must be a letter not in {L,O,A,T} and not in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U, F

Available letters: B, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

- **Guess 2 (salty)**: A, L, T present (A not position 2, L not position 3, T not position 4); S, Y absent.  
- **Guess 3 (adult)**: T is **correct in position 5**; A present (not position 1), L present (not position 4); D, U absent.  
- **Guess 4 (float)**: L **correct in position 2**, O **correct in position 3**, A **correct in position 4**, T **correct in position 5**; F absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 2: **L**  
   - Position 3: **O**  
   - Position 4: **A**  
   - Position 5: **T**  
   - **Word pattern**: `? L O A T` (only position 1 is unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   C, R, N, E, S, Y, D, U, F (cannot appear in the word).  

3. **Possible letters for position 1**:  
   - Must be a valid English letter not in `{L, O, A, T}` (no duplicates confirmed yet) and not absent.  
   - **Candidates**: B, G, H, I, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   - **Common words fitting `?LOAT`**:  
     - `BLOAT` (swell or become inflated)  
     - `GLOAT` (dwell on one's success smugly)  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Only one position is unknown, so prioritize testing a valid word that fits the pattern.  
- `BLOAT` and `GLOAT` are the most common options.  
- **Guess `BLOAT`** to test `B` in position 1:  
  - If correct, the word is solved.  
  - If incorrect, `GLOAT` is the only other common word (next guess).",Guess 5: bloat -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(✓) O(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
