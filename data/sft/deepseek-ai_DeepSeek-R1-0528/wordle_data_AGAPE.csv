We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, we want a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word typically contains common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters in English include vowels and frequent consonants. Let's choose a word with five distinct letters: for instance, ""CRANE"".

But note: We must ensure the word is valid.

Alternatively, consider ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""CRATE"", etc. Another popular starter is ""ROAST"" or ""STARE"". 

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E — common letters.

However, note that sometimes words with S are common. But we can choose.

Let me go with ""SLATE"": It has S, L, A, T, E — two vowels and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — also good.

But note: the game requires 5-letter English word.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions? Wait, let's interpret:

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word.

So for SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (so position 3 must be A)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position (so position 5 must be E)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- And does not have: S, L, T

Since T and S and L are absent, we must avoid them.

Now, we know the word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position. Form: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word
- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)
- Includes other letters that might be common

But we don't know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form _ _ A _ E
- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.

However, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.

But note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn't necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.

Alternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.

Let's consider:

We know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E

We eliminated S, L, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.

For the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.

However, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So, the word should be: ? ? A ? E

And we must avoid S, L, T.

What words are in English? Let's think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that's not exactly: it's third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.

So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.

Common consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let's think of words.

Possible words:

- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven't tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.

But is CRANE valid? Yes, it's a 5-letter word.

However, we haven't tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.

But note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.

So CRANE is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.

But we might have other words.

But note: we don't know anything about C, R, N or B, K.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn't be testing two known positions.

But if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn't have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn't make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don't know if there are multiple A or E? But that's rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.

Moreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don't have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:

Suppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:
- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don't know.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, to maximize information, let's stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E

And test new letters in the other positions.

So:

Option 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E
- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.

But the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.

""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.

""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don't know.

CRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.

Similarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn't have A? So that wouldn't work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't put A, then we won't check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.

Alternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it's fine? We can test other letters.

But we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don't include them, we don't get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:

For example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:

- C: maybe not?
- R: maybe?
- U: maybe?
- M: maybe?
- B: maybe?

But then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.

So we don't get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don't put them, we don't get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it's better to include them?

Or not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?

But we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.

So, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.

Therefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven't tried C, R, N.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don't have A at 3? So this doesn't have A? So it's not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it's not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it's better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.

Therefore, I choose:

Pattern: X Y A Z E

Avoid letters: S, L, T

And we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N
- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K
- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that's okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But it's acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.

However, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let's compare the letters:

CRANE: C,R,N → we haven't tested C,R, any? And N is common? 
GRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that's fine.

But CRANE brings more common letters? 

Alternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can't use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? 

Therefore, avoid T.

Let me consider: 

- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.

- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:
  Position1: D
  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it's useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:
  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it's in the word but not at position2? Or if there's another A? But we don't know)
  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn't the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?

It's complicated.

But note: we know A is at position3? So if we don't put A at position3, then we get:
- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? 

Therefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? 

Therefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.

So, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? 

Another word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.

""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? 

But I think CRANE is simpler? 

Other words: 
- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.
- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? 
- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? 
- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn't have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? 

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? 

""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? 

""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? 

OR ""PRICE""?: Doesn't have A? 

Actually, CRANE is fine? 

But note: CRANE was used in the example? But it's a valid word? 

So, I'll guess CRANE? 

But wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? 

""CRANE"" has C,R,N? 

But also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K 

Or ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? 

Yes, avoid T.

So CRANE seems good? 

Final choice: CRANE? 

But let's see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? 

Anyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? 

So next guess: CRANE

Return: <guess>CRANE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)

This means:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (since they received ✓).
- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).
- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).

Considering these:
- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.

Other options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess>",CRANE,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions? Wait, let's interpret:

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word.

So for SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (so position 3 must be A)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position (so position 5 must be E)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- And does not have: S, L, T

Since T and S and L are absent, we must avoid them.

Now, we know the word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position. Form: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word
- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)
- Includes other letters that might be common

But we don't know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form _ _ A _ E
- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.

However, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.

But note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn't necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.

Alternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.

Let's consider:

We know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E

We eliminated S, L, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.

For the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.

However, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So, the word should be: ? ? A ? E

And we must avoid S, L, T.

What words are in English? Let's think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that's not exactly: it's third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.

So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.

Common consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let's think of words.

Possible words:

- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven't tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.

But is CRANE valid? Yes, it's a 5-letter word.

However, we haven't tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.

But note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.

So CRANE is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.

But we might have other words.

But note: we don't know anything about C, R, N or B, K.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn't be testing two known positions.

But if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn't have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn't make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don't know if there are multiple A or E? But that's rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.

Moreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don't have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:

Suppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:
- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don't know.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, to maximize information, let's stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E

And test new letters in the other positions.

So:

Option 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E
- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.

But the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.

""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.

""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don't know.

CRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.

Similarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn't have A? So that wouldn't work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't put A, then we won't check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.

Alternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it's fine? We can test other letters.

But we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don't include them, we don't get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:

For example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:

- C: maybe not?
- R: maybe?
- U: maybe?
- M: maybe?
- B: maybe?

But then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.

So we don't get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don't put them, we don't get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it's better to include them?

Or not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?

But we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.

So, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.

Therefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven't tried C, R, N.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don't have A at 3? So this doesn't have A? So it's not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it's not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it's better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.

Therefore, I choose:

Pattern: X Y A Z E

Avoid letters: S, L, T

And we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N
- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K
- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that's okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But it's acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.

However, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let's compare the letters:

CRANE: C,R,N → we haven't tested C,R, any? And N is common? 
GRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that's fine.

But CRANE brings more common letters? 

Alternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can't use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? 

Therefore, avoid T.

Let me consider: 

- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.

- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:
  Position1: D
  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it's useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:
  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it's in the word but not at position2? Or if there's another A? But we don't know)
  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn't the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?

It's complicated.

But note: we know A is at position3? So if we don't put A at position3, then we get:
- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? 

Therefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? 

Therefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.

So, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? 

Another word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.

""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? 

But I think CRANE is simpler? 

Other words: 
- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.
- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? 
- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? 
- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn't have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? 

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? 

""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? 

""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? 

OR ""PRICE""?: Doesn't have A? 

Actually, CRANE is fine? 

But note: CRANE was used in the example? But it's a valid word? 

So, I'll guess CRANE? 

But wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? 

""CRANE"" has C,R,N? 

But also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K 

Or ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? 

Yes, avoid T.

So CRANE seems good? 

Final choice: CRANE? 

But let's see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? 

Anyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? 

So next guess: CRANE

Return: <guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)

This means:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (since they received ✓).
- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).
- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).

Considering these:
- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.

Other options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.",Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, we want a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word typically contains common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters in English include vowels and frequent consonants. Let's choose a word with five distinct letters: for instance, ""CRANE"".

But note: We must ensure the word is valid.

Alternatively, consider ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""CRATE"", etc. Another popular starter is ""ROAST"" or ""STARE"". 

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E — common letters.

However, note that sometimes words with S are common. But we can choose.

Let me go with ""SLATE"": It has S, L, A, T, E — two vowels and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — also good.

But note: the game requires 5-letter English word.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

So, first guess: SLATE

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions? Wait, let's interpret:

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word.

So for SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (so position 3 must be A)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position (so position 5 must be E)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- And does not have: S, L, T

Since T and S and L are absent, we must avoid them.

Now, we know the word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position. Form: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word
- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)
- Includes other letters that might be common

But we don't know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form _ _ A _ E
- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.

However, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.

But note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn't necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.

Alternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.

Let's consider:

We know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E

We eliminated S, L, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.

For the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.

However, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So, the word should be: ? ? A ? E

And we must avoid S, L, T.

What words are in English? Let's think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that's not exactly: it's third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.

So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.

Common consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let's think of words.

Possible words:

- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven't tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.

But is CRANE valid? Yes, it's a 5-letter word.

However, we haven't tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.

But note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.

So CRANE is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.

But we might have other words.

But note: we don't know anything about C, R, N or B, K.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn't be testing two known positions.

But if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn't have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn't make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don't know if there are multiple A or E? But that's rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.

Moreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don't have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:

Suppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:
- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don't know.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, to maximize information, let's stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E

And test new letters in the other positions.

So:

Option 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E
- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.

But the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.

""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.

""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don't know.

CRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.

Similarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn't have A? So that wouldn't work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't put A, then we won't check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.

Alternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it's fine? We can test other letters.

But we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don't include them, we don't get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:

For example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:

- C: maybe not?
- R: maybe?
- U: maybe?
- M: maybe?
- B: maybe?

But then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.

So we don't get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don't put them, we don't get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it's better to include them?

Or not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?

But we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.

So, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.

Therefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven't tried C, R, N.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don't have A at 3? So this doesn't have A? So it's not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it's not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it's better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.

Therefore, I choose:

Pattern: X Y A Z E

Avoid letters: S, L, T

And we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N
- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K
- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that's okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But it's acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.

However, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let's compare the letters:

CRANE: C,R,N → we haven't tested C,R, any? And N is common? 
GRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that's fine.

But CRANE brings more common letters? 

Alternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can't use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? 

Therefore, avoid T.

Let me consider: 

- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.

- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:
  Position1: D
  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it's useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:
  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it's in the word but not at position2? Or if there's another A? But we don't know)
  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn't the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?

It's complicated.

But note: we know A is at position3? So if we don't put A at position3, then we get:
- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? 

Therefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? 

Therefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.

So, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? 

Another word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.

""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? 

But I think CRANE is simpler? 

Other words: 
- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.
- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? 
- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? 
- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn't have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? 

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? 

""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? 

""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? 

OR ""PRICE""?: Doesn't have A? 

Actually, CRANE is fine? 

But note: CRANE was used in the example? But it's a valid word? 

So, I'll guess CRANE? 

But wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? 

""CRANE"" has C,R,N? 

But also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K 

Or ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? 

Yes, avoid T.

So CRANE seems good? 

Final choice: CRANE? 

But let's see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? 

Anyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? 

So next guess: CRANE

Return: <guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)

This means:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (since they received ✓).
- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).
- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).

Considering these:
- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.

Other options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.

Wait, let\'s interpret:\n\nThe feedback symbols:\n- ✓: correct letter in correct position\n- -: letter in word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in word.\n\nSo for SLATE:\n- S: x → not in the word\n- L: x → not in the word\n- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (so position 3 must be A)\n- T: x → not in the word\n- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position (so position 5 must be E)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 5: E\n- And does not have: S, L, T\n\nSince T and S and L are absent, we must avoid them.\n\nNow, we know the word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position. Form: _ _ A _ E\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word\n- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)\n- Includes other letters that might be common\n\nBut we don\'t know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Has the form _ _ A _ E\n- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.\n\nBut note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn\'t necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n\nWe know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E\n\nWe eliminated S, L, T.\n\nWe should consider common letters that haven\'t been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.\n\nFor the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.\n\nHowever, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSo, the word should be: ? ? A ? E\n\nAnd we must avoid S, L, T.\n\nWhat words are in English? Let\'s think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that\'s not exactly: it\'s third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.\n\nSo pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E\n\nWe need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.\n\nCommon consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let\'s think of words.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven\'t tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.\n\nBut is CRANE valid? Yes, it\'s a 5-letter word.\n\nHowever, we haven\'t tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.\n\nBut note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.\n\nSo CRANE is a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.\n\nBut we might have other words.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know anything about C, R, N or B, K.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn\'t be testing two known positions.\n\nBut if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn\'t have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn\'t make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don\'t know if there are multiple A or E? But that\'s rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.\n\nMoreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don\'t have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:\n\nSuppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:\n- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nTherefore, to maximize information, let\'s stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nAnd test new letters in the other positions.\n\nSo:\n\nOption 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E\n- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.\n\nBut the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.\n\n""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.\n\n""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don\'t know.\n\nCRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn\'t have A? So that wouldn\'t work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don\'t have to? But if we don\'t put A, then we won\'t check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it\'s fine? We can test other letters.\n\nBut we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don\'t include them, we don\'t get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:\n\nFor example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:\n\n- C: maybe not?\n- R: maybe?\n- U: maybe?\n- M: maybe?\n- B: maybe?\n\nBut then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.\n\nSo we don\'t get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don\'t put them, we don\'t get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it\'s better to include them?\n\nOr not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?\n\nBut we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.\n\nSo, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.\n\nTherefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven\'t tried C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don\'t have A at 3? So this doesn\'t have A? So it\'s not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it\'s not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it\'s better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\nPattern: X Y A Z E\n\nAvoid letters: S, L, T\n\nAnd we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N\n- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K\n- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that\'s okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But it\'s acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.\n\nHowever, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let\'s compare the letters:\n\nCRANE: C,R,N → we haven\'t tested C,R, any? And N is common? \nGRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut CRANE brings more common letters? \n\nAlternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can\'t use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? \n\nTherefore, avoid T.\n\nLet me consider: \n\n- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.\n\n- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:\n  Position1: D\n  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it\'s useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:\n  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it\'s in the word but not at position2? Or if there\'s another A? But we don\'t know)\n  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn\'t the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?\n\nIt\'s complicated.\n\nBut note: we know A is at position3? So if we don\'t put A at position3, then we get:\n- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? \n\nTherefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? \n\nTherefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.\n\nSo, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? \n\nAnother word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.\n\n""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? \n\nBut I think CRANE is simpler? \n\nOther words: \n- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.\n- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? \n- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? \n- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn\'t have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? \n\n""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? \n\n""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? \n\nOR ""PRICE""?: Doesn\'t have A? \n\nActually, CRANE is fine? \n\nBut note: CRANE was used in the example? But it\'s a valid word? \n\nSo, I\'ll guess CRANE? \n\nBut wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? \n\n""CRANE"" has C,R,N? \n\nBut also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K \n\nOr ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? \n\nYes, avoid T.\n\nSo CRANE seems good? \n\nFinal choice: CRANE? \n\nBut let\'s see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? \n\nAnyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? \n\nSo next guess: CRANE\n\nReturn: <guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": \n- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word has \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5 (since they received ✓).\n- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).\n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.\n- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).\n- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).\n\nConsidering these:\n- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.\n- It avoids S, L, T.\n- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.\n\nOther options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have two rounds of feedback:
1. Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
2. Guess 2: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- From Guess 1 and 2, we can confirm:
  - Position 3: A (correct and fixed)
  - Position 5: E (correct and fixed)
  - Letters not in word: S, L, T from Guess 1; and now from Guess 2: C, R, N are also not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E

And the missing letters must not be: S, L, T, C, R, N

Now, we need to consider what letters are still possible.

Since we tested: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N (from both guesses)

We know A and E are in the word but fixed at their positions. So the other letters must be different.

We have used 9 letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N.

The English alphabet has 26 letters, so many more possible.

But we must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

We also know that the secret word has the form: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, E.

And we need letter1, letter2, letter4 to be letters not yet tested? Well, we have tested some that are eliminated.

Now, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- Avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N.
- Choose new letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 that are common and likely in the word.

But note: we don't know what letters are in the word? Only A and E? So we have to test.

Possible common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose three new letters to test.

We should form a valid English word of the pattern: ? ? A ? E

Avoiding S,L,T,C,R,N.

Possible words:

- ""GAZED""? But ""Z"" is less common? And pattern: G A Z E D → wait, position 3: Z? No, we need position 3: A? Not present? We must have A at 3.

Pattern must be: [1][2]A[4]E

So, possibilities:

- ""BAKED"": B(1), A(2? No: positions: B at1, A at2, K at3? But we need A at 3? So: B A ? BUT no: ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D → that doesn't have A at position 3? Position 3 is K.

We need the third letter to be A: so words like ? ? A ? E

Examples:

- ""MAKER"": M A K E R → positions: 1:M, 2:A? No: let's spell positions: 
  Position1: M
  Position2: A? But we need position 3: A? That would require the word to have A as the third letter? So:
  For example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E → pattern: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E → yes!
  But L is eliminated? Because from guess1: L was x? So L is not in the word? Therefore, BLADE has L? Invalid? 
  We cannot use any word with L? Or T? Etc.

Thus, must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHADE""? But S is eliminated? And H? H at position2? But ""SHADE"": S-H-A-D-E → S is bad? Eliminated.

""GRAPE"": G-R-A-P-E → positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E? Perfect? But R is eliminated? From guess2: R was x? So R is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use R? ""GRAPE"" has R? So invalid.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B-R-A-V-E → R? Bad? R is eliminated.

Therefore, avoid R.

Now, possible words:

What words fit ? ? A ? E:

With common letters:

For example, ""KAZOO""? Not ending with E? Must end with E.

""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E → pattern: 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E? Avoids S,L,T,C,R,N? Yes: letters I, M, G? All not tested? ""IMAGE"" is a valid word? Yes? Like a picture? But let's confirm: I-M-A-G-E → that's 5 letters? Yes? So it works? But we have to be careful: what letters does it use? I, M, A, G, E? Avoids the bad letters? Yes? 

Another word: ""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D → but position 3: V? No: P(1), A(2)? Then position 3: V? So pattern wrong? 

""FIADE""? Not a word? 

""DIANE""? D-I-A-N-E → positions:1:D,2:I,3:A,4:N,5:E? But N is eliminated? From guess2: N(x)? So can't use N? 

""MAPLE"": M-A-P-L-E → but L is eliminated? Bad? 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E → pattern:1:G,2:A? Position 3: F? Not A? Pattern wrong? 

""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E → but first letter A? So: positions:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E? But we are putting A at position1? Then if the secret word has A at position3? We should get - for A at position1? And at position3: we put A? So we also put A at3? This might be confusing? But technically? Also using A twice? 

But feedback: 
Position1: A? Since the secret has A only at position3? So it should get -? 
Position3: A? ✓? 
But that is possible? 

But is AGAPE a word? Yes? Meaning? 

However, avoiding bad letters: AGAPE? Letters: A, G, A, P, E → so we are repeating A? And E? 

But we want to test new letters? We are putting G and P? 

But also, we know A is at position3? So putting A at position1: then we expect:

- Position1: A -> ? Because A is in the word? But at wrong position? So -?
- Position3: A -> ✓?
- Position2: G -> ? not tested?
- Position4: P -> not tested?
- Position5: E -> ✓?

So we get feedback for G and P? And also confirm A at3? 

But we are using one of the guesses? So AGAPE is a possibility? 

But let's list words that are valid: 

Pattern [1][2]A[4]E

And [1][2][4] must not be S,L,T,C,R,N? And the letters must be untested? 

Another word: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D → but no: position3 is V? Pattern wrong? 

We need words like: 

- ""IMAGE"": as I said earlier? I-M-A-G-E? Yes? 
  Positions:1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E -> avoid bad letters? I,M,G? Not tested? 
  Word: IMAGE? Valid? Yes? 

- ""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E? Positions:1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:K,5:E -> avoid bad letters? Q,U,K are new? 
  But Q and U are less common? 

- ""OATEN"": O-A-T-E-N -> T and N are bad: T eliminated? N eliminated? 

- ""DAMME"": Not standard? 

- ""FAIRE"": Old English? Not modern? 

""IMAGE"" seems good? 

Another: ""BRAES""? Plural of brae? But not? And S? Avoid? 

""CHARD""? Not ending with E? Different pattern? 

""HAVEN"": H-A-V-E-N -> N? But N eliminated? 

""GAMED"": G-A-M-E-D -> position3: M? Not A? 

Back to IMAGE? 

""IMATE""? Not a word? And T? Bad? 

So IMAGE is a good candidate? 

But what about ""PAYED""? P-A-Y-E-D? Not pattern? Position? P(1),A(2),Y(3),E(4),D(5) -> position3 is Y? Not A? Wrong? 

We must have A at position3? So the words must be XYA?E? So ending with E? 

Another common word: ""ABATE""? But T? Bad? And A not at3? 

""BEAKE""? Not a word? 

""IMAGE"" appears to be solid? 

Another: ""MAGUE""? Not common? 

Or ""AGATE""? T bad? 

So I think IMAGE is acceptable? 

Perhaps ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E? Position3: G? Not A? No? 

""VAUDE""? Not? 

Therefore, let's choose IMAGE: it has I, M, G? And we haven't tested these? 

So next guess: IMAGE? 

But note: IMAGE? 

Pattern: I, M, A, G, E? Yes? 

So <guess>IMAGE</guess>? 

But let me confirm feedback? 

Secret must be ? ? A ? E? 

Yes? 

Will IMAGE work? 

Perhaps ""PAVE""? Not 5 letters? 

""SAVEE""? Not? 

So IMAGE is a word? As in icon or picture? 

Yes? 

Final decision: IMAGE? 

But I'm considering: what if ""PLAGE""? But L? Bad? 

So? 

But IMAGE? 

Maybe ""BAKED""? Pattern wrong? 

Perhaps change? 

Another word: ""GAWKS""? No E? 

I think IMAGE is our best? 

So guess: IMAGE? 

Return: <guess>IMAGE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)**  
  This confirms:
  - Position 3 must be 'A' (correct and fixed).
  - Position 5 must be 'E' (correct and fixed).
  - Letters S, L, and T are NOT in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This confirms:
  - Positions 3 and 5 remain fixed ('A' and 'E').
  - Letters C, R, and N are also NOT in the secret word.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[ ] [ ] A [ ] E`
- **Eliminated letters** (not in the word at all): S, L, T, C, R, N.
- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 2, and 4 must be filled with letters not yet tested or eliminated. These letters must be from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the eliminated ones.
- **Remaining letters**: Common letters to test include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for New Guess:
- Maintain 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 to preserve known correct letters.
- Avoid eliminated letters (S, L, T, C, R, N).
- Introduce three new, common letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information gain.

After considering valid 5-letter words fitting `[ ] [ ] A [ ] E` with available letters:
- **IMAGE** (I-M-A-G-E) fits perfectly:
  - Position 1: 'I' (new, untested vowel).
  - Position 2: 'M' (new, common consonant).
  - Position 3: 'A' (fixed, expected ✓).
  - Position 4: 'G' (new, common consonant).
  - Position 5: 'E' (fixed, expected ✓).
- All letters avoid eliminated characters (S,L,T,C,R,N).
- ""IMAGE"" is a valid English word (e.g., a visual representation) and tests high-frequency letters.

This guess efficiently tests new letters while leveraging confirmed positions to narrow possibilities.

<guess>IMAGE</guess>",IMAGE,"We have two rounds of feedback:
1. Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
2. Guess 2: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- From Guess 1 and 2, we can confirm:
  - Position 3: A (correct and fixed)
  - Position 5: E (correct and fixed)
  - Letters not in word: S, L, T from Guess 1; and now from Guess 2: C, R, N are also not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E

And the missing letters must not be: S, L, T, C, R, N

Now, we need to consider what letters are still possible.

Since we tested: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N (from both guesses)

We know A and E are in the word but fixed at their positions. So the other letters must be different.

We have used 9 letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N.

The English alphabet has 26 letters, so many more possible.

But we must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

We also know that the secret word has the form: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, E.

And we need letter1, letter2, letter4 to be letters not yet tested? Well, we have tested some that are eliminated.

Now, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- Avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N.
- Choose new letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 that are common and likely in the word.

But note: we don't know what letters are in the word? Only A and E? So we have to test.

Possible common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose three new letters to test.

We should form a valid English word of the pattern: ? ? A ? E

Avoiding S,L,T,C,R,N.

Possible words:

- ""GAZED""? But ""Z"" is less common? And pattern: G A Z E D → wait, position 3: Z? No, we need position 3: A? Not present? We must have A at 3.

Pattern must be: [1][2]A[4]E

So, possibilities:

- ""BAKED"": B(1), A(2? No: positions: B at1, A at2, K at3? But we need A at 3? So: B A ? BUT no: ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D → that doesn't have A at position 3? Position 3 is K.

We need the third letter to be A: so words like ? ? A ? E

Examples:

- ""MAKER"": M A K E R → positions: 1:M, 2:A? No: let's spell positions: 
  Position1: M
  Position2: A? But we need position 3: A? That would require the word to have A as the third letter? So:
  For example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E → pattern: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E → yes!
  But L is eliminated? Because from guess1: L was x? So L is not in the word? Therefore, BLADE has L? Invalid? 
  We cannot use any word with L? Or T? Etc.

Thus, must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHADE""? But S is eliminated? And H? H at position2? But ""SHADE"": S-H-A-D-E → S is bad? Eliminated.

""GRAPE"": G-R-A-P-E → positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E? Perfect? But R is eliminated? From guess2: R was x? So R is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use R? ""GRAPE"" has R? So invalid.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B-R-A-V-E → R? Bad? R is eliminated.

Therefore, avoid R.

Now, possible words:

What words fit ? ? A ? E:

With common letters:

For example, ""KAZOO""? Not ending with E? Must end with E.

""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E → pattern: 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E? Avoids S,L,T,C,R,N? Yes: letters I, M, G? All not tested? ""IMAGE"" is a valid word? Yes? Like a picture? But let's confirm: I-M-A-G-E → that's 5 letters? Yes? So it works? But we have to be careful: what letters does it use? I, M, A, G, E? Avoids the bad letters? Yes? 

Another word: ""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D → but position 3: V? No: P(1), A(2)? Then position 3: V? So pattern wrong? 

""FIADE""? Not a word? 

""DIANE""? D-I-A-N-E → positions:1:D,2:I,3:A,4:N,5:E? But N is eliminated? From guess2: N(x)? So can't use N? 

""MAPLE"": M-A-P-L-E → but L is eliminated? Bad? 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E → pattern:1:G,2:A? Position 3: F? Not A? Pattern wrong? 

""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E → but first letter A? So: positions:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E? But we are putting A at position1? Then if the secret word has A at position3? We should get - for A at position1? And at position3: we put A? So we also put A at3? This might be confusing? But technically? Also using A twice? 

But feedback: 
Position1: A? Since the secret has A only at position3? So it should get -? 
Position3: A? ✓? 
But that is possible? 

But is AGAPE a word? Yes? Meaning? 

However, avoiding bad letters: AGAPE? Letters: A, G, A, P, E → so we are repeating A? And E? 

But we want to test new letters? We are putting G and P? 

But also, we know A is at position3? So putting A at position1: then we expect:

- Position1: A -> ? Because A is in the word? But at wrong position? So -?
- Position3: A -> ✓?
- Position2: G -> ? not tested?
- Position4: P -> not tested?
- Position5: E -> ✓?

So we get feedback for G and P? And also confirm A at3? 

But we are using one of the guesses? So AGAPE is a possibility? 

But let's list words that are valid: 

Pattern [1][2]A[4]E

And [1][2][4] must not be S,L,T,C,R,N? And the letters must be untested? 

Another word: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D → but no: position3 is V? Pattern wrong? 

We need words like: 

- ""IMAGE"": as I said earlier? I-M-A-G-E? Yes? 
  Positions:1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E -> avoid bad letters? I,M,G? Not tested? 
  Word: IMAGE? Valid? Yes? 

- ""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E? Positions:1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:K,5:E -> avoid bad letters? Q,U,K are new? 
  But Q and U are less common? 

- ""OATEN"": O-A-T-E-N -> T and N are bad: T eliminated? N eliminated? 

- ""DAMME"": Not standard? 

- ""FAIRE"": Old English? Not modern? 

""IMAGE"" seems good? 

Another: ""BRAES""? Plural of brae? But not? And S? Avoid? 

""CHARD""? Not ending with E? Different pattern? 

""HAVEN"": H-A-V-E-N -> N? But N eliminated? 

""GAMED"": G-A-M-E-D -> position3: M? Not A? 

Back to IMAGE? 

""IMATE""? Not a word? And T? Bad? 

So IMAGE is a good candidate? 

But what about ""PAYED""? P-A-Y-E-D? Not pattern? Position? P(1),A(2),Y(3),E(4),D(5) -> position3 is Y? Not A? Wrong? 

We must have A at position3? So the words must be XYA?E? So ending with E? 

Another common word: ""ABATE""? But T? Bad? And A not at3? 

""BEAKE""? Not a word? 

""IMAGE"" appears to be solid? 

Another: ""MAGUE""? Not common? 

Or ""AGATE""? T bad? 

So I think IMAGE is acceptable? 

Perhaps ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E? Position3: G? Not A? No? 

""VAUDE""? Not? 

Therefore, let's choose IMAGE: it has I, M, G? And we haven't tested these? 

So next guess: IMAGE? 

But note: IMAGE? 

Pattern: I, M, A, G, E? Yes? 

So <guess>IMAGE</guess>? 

But let me confirm feedback? 

Secret must be ? ? A ? E? 

Yes? 

Will IMAGE work? 

Perhaps ""PAVE""? Not 5 letters? 

""SAVEE""? Not? 

So IMAGE is a word? As in icon or picture? 

Yes? 

Final decision: IMAGE? 

But I'm considering: what if ""PLAGE""? But L? Bad? 

So? 

But IMAGE? 

Maybe ""BAKED""? Pattern wrong? 

Perhaps change? 

Another word: ""GAWKS""? No E? 

I think IMAGE is our best? 

So guess: IMAGE?

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Without any prior information, we want a word that maximizes information gain. 
A good starting word typically contains common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters in English include vowels and frequent consonants. Let's choose a word with five distinct letters: for instance, ""CRANE"".

But note: We must ensure the word is valid.

Alternatively, consider ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""CRATE"", etc. Another popular starter is ""ROAST"" or ""STARE"". 

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E — common letters.

However, note that sometimes words with S are common. But we can choose.

Let me go with ""SLATE"": It has S, L, A, T, E — two vowels and three common consonants.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E — also good.

But note: the game requires 5-letter English word.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" for the first guess.

So, first guess: SLATE

<guess>SLATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""SLATE"": S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
This means:
- A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions? Wait, let's interpret:

The feedback symbols:
- ✓: correct letter in correct position
- -: letter in word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word.

So for SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (so position 3 must be A)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → E is in the word and in the correct position (so position 5 must be E)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E
- And does not have: S, L, T

Since T and S and L are absent, we must avoid them.

Now, we know the word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position. Form: _ _ A _ E

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word
- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)
- Includes other letters that might be common

But we don't know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.

We should choose a word that:
- Has the form _ _ A _ E
- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.

However, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.

But note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn't necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.

Alternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.

Let's consider:

We know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E

We eliminated S, L, T.

We should consider common letters that haven't been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.

For the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.

However, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.

So, the word should be: ? ? A ? E

And we must avoid S, L, T.

What words are in English? Let's think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that's not exactly: it's third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.

So pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

We need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.

Common consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let's think of words.

Possible words:

- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven't tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.

But is CRANE valid? Yes, it's a 5-letter word.

However, we haven't tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.

But note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.

So CRANE is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.

But we might have other words.

But note: we don't know anything about C, R, N or B, K.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn't be testing two known positions.

But if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn't have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn't make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don't know if there are multiple A or E? But that's rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.

Moreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don't have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:

Suppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:
- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don't know.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, to maximize information, let's stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E

And test new letters in the other positions.

So:

Option 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E
- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.

But the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.

Another word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.

""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.

""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don't know.

CRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.

Similarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn't have A? So that wouldn't work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't put A, then we won't check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.

Alternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it's fine? We can test other letters.

But we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don't include them, we don't get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:

For example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:

- C: maybe not?
- R: maybe?
- U: maybe?
- M: maybe?
- B: maybe?

But then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.

So we don't get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don't put them, we don't get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it's better to include them?

Or not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?

But we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.

So, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.

Therefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven't tried C, R, N.

Similarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don't have A at 3? So this doesn't have A? So it's not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it's not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it's better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.

Therefore, I choose:

Pattern: X Y A Z E

Avoid letters: S, L, T

And we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N
- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K
- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that's okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don't know if there are duplicates? But it's acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.

However, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let's compare the letters:

CRANE: C,R,N → we haven't tested C,R, any? And N is common? 
GRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that's fine.

But CRANE brings more common letters? 

Alternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can't use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? 

Therefore, avoid T.

Let me consider: 

- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.

- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:
  Position1: D
  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it's useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:
  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it's in the word but not at position2? Or if there's another A? But we don't know)
  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn't the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?

It's complicated.

But note: we know A is at position3? So if we don't put A at position3, then we get:
- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? 

Therefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? 

Therefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.

So, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? 

Another word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.

""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? 

But I think CRANE is simpler? 

Other words: 
- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.
- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? 
- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? 
- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn't have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? 

Therefore, I'll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? 

""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? 

""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? 

OR ""PRICE""?: Doesn't have A? 

Actually, CRANE is fine? 

But note: CRANE was used in the example? But it's a valid word? 

So, I'll guess CRANE? 

But wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? 

""CRANE"" has C,R,N? 

But also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K 

Or ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? 

Yes, avoid T.

So CRANE seems good? 

Final choice: CRANE? 

But let's see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? 

Anyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? 

So next guess: CRANE

Return: <guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": 
- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)

This means:
- The secret word has 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 (since they received ✓).
- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E

For the next guess:
- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).
- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).

Considering these:
- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.
- It avoids S, L, T.
- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.

Other options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two rounds of feedback:
1. Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
2. Guess 2: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)

Interpretation:
- From Guess 1 and 2, we can confirm:
  - Position 3: A (correct and fixed)
  - Position 5: E (correct and fixed)
  - Letters not in word: S, L, T from Guess 1; and now from Guess 2: C, R, N are also not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E

And the missing letters must not be: S, L, T, C, R, N

Now, we need to consider what letters are still possible.

Since we tested: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N (from both guesses)

We know A and E are in the word but fixed at their positions. So the other letters must be different.

We have used 9 letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N.

The English alphabet has 26 letters, so many more possible.

But we must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

We also know that the secret word has the form: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, E.

And we need letter1, letter2, letter4 to be letters not yet tested? Well, we have tested some that are eliminated.

Now, for the next guess, we should:
- Keep A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- Avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N.
- Choose new letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 that are common and likely in the word.

But note: we don't know what letters are in the word? Only A and E? So we have to test.

Possible common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to choose three new letters to test.

We should form a valid English word of the pattern: ? ? A ? E

Avoiding S,L,T,C,R,N.

Possible words:

- ""GAZED""? But ""Z"" is less common? And pattern: G A Z E D → wait, position 3: Z? No, we need position 3: A? Not present? We must have A at 3.

Pattern must be: [1][2]A[4]E

So, possibilities:

- ""BAKED"": B(1), A(2? No: positions: B at1, A at2, K at3? But we need A at 3? So: B A ? BUT no: ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D → that doesn't have A at position 3? Position 3 is K.

We need the third letter to be A: so words like ? ? A ? E

Examples:

- ""MAKER"": M A K E R → positions: 1:M, 2:A? No: let's spell positions: 
  Position1: M
  Position2: A? But we need position 3: A? That would require the word to have A as the third letter? So:
  For example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E → pattern: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E → yes!
  But L is eliminated? Because from guess1: L was x? So L is not in the word? Therefore, BLADE has L? Invalid? 
  We cannot use any word with L? Or T? Etc.

Thus, must avoid L.

Another word: ""SHADE""? But S is eliminated? And H? H at position2? But ""SHADE"": S-H-A-D-E → S is bad? Eliminated.

""GRAPE"": G-R-A-P-E → positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E? Perfect? But R is eliminated? From guess2: R was x? So R is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use R? ""GRAPE"" has R? So invalid.

Similarly, ""BRAVE"": B-R-A-V-E → R? Bad? R is eliminated.

Therefore, avoid R.

Now, possible words:

What words fit ? ? A ? E:

With common letters:

For example, ""KAZOO""? Not ending with E? Must end with E.

""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E → pattern: 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E? Avoids S,L,T,C,R,N? Yes: letters I, M, G? All not tested? ""IMAGE"" is a valid word? Yes? Like a picture? But let's confirm: I-M-A-G-E → that's 5 letters? Yes? So it works? But we have to be careful: what letters does it use? I, M, A, G, E? Avoids the bad letters? Yes? 

Another word: ""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D → but position 3: V? No: P(1), A(2)? Then position 3: V? So pattern wrong? 

""FIADE""? Not a word? 

""DIANE""? D-I-A-N-E → positions:1:D,2:I,3:A,4:N,5:E? But N is eliminated? From guess2: N(x)? So can't use N? 

""MAPLE"": M-A-P-L-E → but L is eliminated? Bad? 

""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E → pattern:1:G,2:A? Position 3: F? Not A? Pattern wrong? 

""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E → but first letter A? So: positions:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E? But we are putting A at position1? Then if the secret word has A at position3? We should get - for A at position1? And at position3: we put A? So we also put A at3? This might be confusing? But technically? Also using A twice? 

But feedback: 
Position1: A? Since the secret has A only at position3? So it should get -? 
Position3: A? ✓? 
But that is possible? 

But is AGAPE a word? Yes? Meaning? 

However, avoiding bad letters: AGAPE? Letters: A, G, A, P, E → so we are repeating A? And E? 

But we want to test new letters? We are putting G and P? 

But also, we know A is at position3? So putting A at position1: then we expect:

- Position1: A -> ? Because A is in the word? But at wrong position? So -?
- Position3: A -> ✓?
- Position2: G -> ? not tested?
- Position4: P -> not tested?
- Position5: E -> ✓?

So we get feedback for G and P? And also confirm A at3? 

But we are using one of the guesses? So AGAPE is a possibility? 

But let's list words that are valid: 

Pattern [1][2]A[4]E

And [1][2][4] must not be S,L,T,C,R,N? And the letters must be untested? 

Another word: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D → but no: position3 is V? Pattern wrong? 

We need words like: 

- ""IMAGE"": as I said earlier? I-M-A-G-E? Yes? 
  Positions:1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E -> avoid bad letters? I,M,G? Not tested? 
  Word: IMAGE? Valid? Yes? 

- ""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E? Positions:1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:K,5:E -> avoid bad letters? Q,U,K are new? 
  But Q and U are less common? 

- ""OATEN"": O-A-T-E-N -> T and N are bad: T eliminated? N eliminated? 

- ""DAMME"": Not standard? 

- ""FAIRE"": Old English? Not modern? 

""IMAGE"" seems good? 

Another: ""BRAES""? Plural of brae? But not? And S? Avoid? 

""CHARD""? Not ending with E? Different pattern? 

""HAVEN"": H-A-V-E-N -> N? But N eliminated? 

""GAMED"": G-A-M-E-D -> position3: M? Not A? 

Back to IMAGE? 

""IMATE""? Not a word? And T? Bad? 

So IMAGE is a good candidate? 

But what about ""PAYED""? P-A-Y-E-D? Not pattern? Position? P(1),A(2),Y(3),E(4),D(5) -> position3 is Y? Not A? Wrong? 

We must have A at position3? So the words must be XYA?E? So ending with E? 

Another common word: ""ABATE""? But T? Bad? And A not at3? 

""BEAKE""? Not a word? 

""IMAGE"" appears to be solid? 

Another: ""MAGUE""? Not common? 

Or ""AGATE""? T bad? 

So I think IMAGE is acceptable? 

Perhaps ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E? Position3: G? Not A? No? 

""VAUDE""? Not? 

Therefore, let's choose IMAGE: it has I, M, G? And we haven't tested these? 

So next guess: IMAGE? 

But note: IMAGE? 

Pattern: I, M, A, G, E? Yes? 

So <guess>IMAGE</guess>? 

But let me confirm feedback? 

Secret must be ? ? A ? E? 

Yes? 

Will IMAGE work? 

Perhaps ""PAVE""? Not 5 letters? 

""SAVEE""? Not? 

So IMAGE is a word? As in icon or picture? 

Yes? 

Final decision: IMAGE? 

But I'm considering: what if ""PLAGE""? But L? Bad? 

So? 

But IMAGE? 

Maybe ""BAKED""? Pattern wrong? 

Perhaps change? 

Another word: ""GAWKS""? No E? 

I think IMAGE is our best? 

So guess: IMAGE? 

Return: <guess>IMAGE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)**  
  This confirms:
  - Position 3 must be 'A' (correct and fixed).
  - Position 5 must be 'E' (correct and fixed).
  - Letters S, L, and T are NOT in the secret word.

- **Guess 2: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This confirms:
  - Positions 3 and 5 remain fixed ('A' and 'E').
  - Letters C, R, and N are also NOT in the secret word.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[ ] [ ] A [ ] E`
- **Eliminated letters** (not in the word at all): S, L, T, C, R, N.
- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 2, and 4 must be filled with letters not yet tested or eliminated. These letters must be from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the eliminated ones.
- **Remaining letters**: Common letters to test include B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for New Guess:
- Maintain 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5 to preserve known correct letters.
- Avoid eliminated letters (S, L, T, C, R, N).
- Introduce three new, common letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to maximize information gain.

After considering valid 5-letter words fitting `[ ] [ ] A [ ] E` with available letters:
- **IMAGE** (I-M-A-G-E) fits perfectly:
  - Position 1: 'I' (new, untested vowel).
  - Position 2: 'M' (new, common consonant).
  - Position 3: 'A' (fixed, expected ✓).
  - Position 4: 'G' (new, common consonant).
  - Position 5: 'E' (fixed, expected ✓).
- All letters avoid eliminated characters (S,L,T,C,R,N).
- ""IMAGE"" is a valid English word (e.g., a visual representation) and tests high-frequency letters.

This guess efficiently tests new letters while leveraging confirmed positions to narrow possibilities.

Form: _ _ A _ E\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word\n- Avoids letters S, L, T (because they are not in the word)\n- Includes other letters that might be common\n\nBut we don\'t know what the first, second, and fourth letters are. Therefore, our next guess should try to reveal more about the remaining letters.\n\nWe should choose a word that:\n- Has the form _ _ A _ E\n- But note: the A and E must be in those positions? Actually, in the feedback for SLATE, A and E got ✓ so yes, but in the new word we can choose entirely? Wait, no: we are not required to reuse any positions unless we know they are fixed.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, we might want to test other letters in the unknown positions.\n\nBut note: the secret word has A in position 3 and E in position 5, so our next guess doesn\'t necessarily have to keep A and E? Actually, we can change any letter we want, but if we put A and E in the same positions, we can reconfirm? Not necessary because the feedback already confirmed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the known positions to our advantage and try to guess the other letters.\n\nLet\'s consider:\n\nWe know the word pattern: ? ? A ? E\n\nWe eliminated S, L, T.\n\nWe should consider common letters that haven\'t been tested. Previously we tested S, L, A, T, E. So remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, etc.\n\nFor the new guess, one strategy is to include new consonants and vowels to get more information.\n\nHowever, we might want to reuse the A and E in the correct positions to avoid wasting two positions. That is, we can form a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5, but with new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSo, the word should be: ? ? A ? E\n\nAnd we must avoid S, L, T.\n\nWhat words are in English? Let\'s think of words ending with ""A?E"", but that\'s not exactly: it\'s third letter A and fifth E, so the last two are ? and E? Actually, position 4 is unknown and position 5 is E.\n\nSo pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E\n\nWe need to choose letter1, letter2, letter4 from the remaining alphabet without S, L, T.\n\nCommon consonants and vowels: we already know A and E are present, but might have more vowels? Let\'s think of words.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CRANE? But C, R, N? But we haven\'t tested C, R, N. However, note that CRANE has S? No, CRANE: C R A N E → no S, L, T. But wait: pattern must be ? ? A ? E → CRANE: C (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), E (5). Perfect.\n\nBut is CRANE valid? Yes, it\'s a 5-letter word.\n\nHowever, we haven\'t tested C, R, N. So guessing CRANE would test C in position1, R in position2, N in position4, while keeping A and E fixed.\n\nBut note: the feedback for A and E was ✓ in the previous guess, meaning that in the secret word they are fixed at those positions. So if we put A and E again, we expect them to be ✓ again. But if they were not, it would be inconsistent? Actually, the feedback told us A is in the correct position and E is correct, so we can rely on that.\n\nSo CRANE is a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BRAKE"": B R A K E → similarly, B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). Also avoids S,L,T.\n\nBut we might have other words.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know anything about C, R, N or B, K.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have A and E? That might be less efficient because we wouldn\'t be testing two known positions.\n\nBut if we skip A and E, then we lose the chance to get more information? Actually, we know A and E are in the word, so we must include them somewhere? Not necessarily: we can choose a word that doesn\'t have them so that we test other letters? But that doesn\'t make sense because we already know A and E are present? However, we don\'t know if there are multiple A or E? But that\'s rare? Alternatively, we can try to confirm if they are still there? But unlikely they changed.\n\nMoreover, we are constrained: the word must have A in position 3 and E in position 5? Actually, the secret word has that, but in our guess we don\'t have to — we could put A in a different position? Then we might get ""-"" for A if it is elsewhere? That would give extra information? For example:\n\nSuppose we choose a word with A in a different position? Then:\n- If the secret word has only one A, which is in position 3, then putting A elsewhere would get x? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nTherefore, to maximize information, let\'s stick with the known pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nAnd test new letters in the other positions.\n\nSo:\n\nOption 1: CRANE → letters: C, R, A, N, E\n- We know A and E will get ✓ if the secret remains consistent? We assume so.\n\nBut the secret word might have, say, two E? But unlikely.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANE"" but L is not allowed? We eliminated L? Because L was x? That means L is not in the word, so we must not use L. Similarly T and S. So ""PLANE"" is invalid because it has L? Yes.\n\n""GRAVE"": G R A V E → but V is less common? But acceptable.\n\n""FRAME"": F R A M E → M is common? But we don\'t know.\n\nCRANE is good because it uses common letters: C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRINE"": B R I N E → but then position 3 is I? Wait, no, we need A at 3? BRINE: B-R-I-N-E → no A? So that doesn\'t have A? So that wouldn\'t work? Because we want to test the A? Actually, we don\'t have to? But if we don\'t put A, then we won\'t check if A is still in position 3? And E? Similarly.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess without A and E? But then it\'s fine? We can test other letters.\n\nBut we know A and E are in the secret word? From the previous feedback? Yes: A is in the word and in position 3, so it must be there? And E similarly in position 5. So they are fixed? So we can rely on that? Therefore, we can omit them? Actually no, because the word must be 5-letter? But if we don\'t include them, we don\'t get feedback about their presence? But we already know? And the feedback would show:\n\nFor example, if we guess ""CRUMB"": C R U M B → then if the secret word is ""?A?E"", then U might be in there? But without A and E, the feedback will show:\n\n- C: maybe not?\n- R: maybe?\n- U: maybe?\n- M: maybe?\n- B: maybe?\n\nBut then for position 3: we have U, but the secret has A? So U vs A, so U would be x? Similarly position 5: B vs E → B would be x.\n\nSo we don\'t get new information about the presence of A and E? But we already know A and E are in? So when we don\'t put them, we don\'t get any new? But we might miss the opportunity to test if they are still there? Actually, they are fixed? So I think it\'s better to include them?\n\nOr not? Because we can use those positions to test other letters? For example, if we put a different letter in position 3, then if the secret has A there, we would get x for that letter? But also if we put A elsewhere? Then we can see?\n\nBut we know A is in position 3? So putting A in position 3 in our guess makes sense to reconfirm? It also tests the letter at position 3? But that might be unnecessary? Similarly E.\n\nSo, let me stick to the pattern and use a word that has A in position 3 and E in position 5? And avoid S, L, T.\n\nTherefore, CRANE is a good candidate? Let me check the letters: we haven\'t tried C, R, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRONE"": P R O N E → but pattern is P-R on positions 1 and 2? And O at 4? So: P, R, O, N, E → but position 3 is O? But we need A at 3? So ""PRONE"" is P R O N E → positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E → but we don\'t have A at 3? So this doesn\'t have A? So it\'s not testing A? And we know the secret has A at 3? So we expect position 3 to be A? Therefore, putting anything else there will be x? Because it\'s not A? So effectively, position 3 in our guess would get x? And similarly position 5: E at 5? So non-E at position 5 would get x? So we waste two positions? Therefore, I think it\'s better to lock in the A at 3 and E at 5? And use other positions to test new letters.\n\nTherefore, I choose:\n\nPattern: X Y A Z E\n\nAvoid letters: S, L, T\n\nAnd we have tested: S, L, A, T, E → so unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- CRANE → C R A N E → letters C, R, N\n- BRAKE → B R A K E → letters B, R, K\n- GRAPE → G R A P E → but E is repeated? But that\'s okay? But wait, position 5 is E? And grape has P? Wait: G R A P E → position 4 is P? So GRAPE: G R A P E → avoids S,L,T? But E is at the end? But the secret word must have E at the end? But grape has E at the end? Also, if the secret word has only one E? Then putting E at position 5 is fine? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But it\'s acceptable? But note, grape is a valid word? Yes? But actually, grape is 5 letters? Yes? So GRAPE is another possibility? But GRAPE is a fruit? Valid.\n\nHowever, I think CRANE is slightly better? Or let\'s compare the letters:\n\nCRANE: C,R,N → we haven\'t tested C,R, any? And N is common? \nGRAPE: G,R,A,P,E → we have A and E again? But A and E we already know? And G and P? P is common? But also, note that in GRAPE, we are repeating E? But E is at position 5? Same as the secret? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut CRANE brings more common letters? \n\nAlternatively, words like ""IRATE""? But T is eliminated? We can\'t use T because T was x → not in the word? So IRATE has T? So invalid? \n\nTherefore, avoid T.\n\nLet me consider: \n\n- FRAME? F R A M E → F,R,M → avoid S,L,T? Yes.\n\n- DANCE? D A? Wait, pattern: D A N C E? Positions: D at1, A at2, N at3, C at4, E at5? But wait: we need position 3 to be A? So if I put DANCE: D A N C E → then:\n  Position1: D\n  Position2: A → but in the secret, A is at position3? So putting A at position2: this might be bad? Because I know A should be at position3? So putting A at position2: then we expect if the secret has A only at3, then we get - for A? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? And position2: we would get feedback for that letter? But actually, it\'s useful? Because we can test? For example, if we put A at position2, and the secret has A at3, then we get:\n  Position2: A → symbol: - (since it\'s in the word but not at position2? Or if there\'s another A? But we don\'t know)\n  And position3: N → we put N? Then if the secret has A at3? Then N would be compared? If N isn\'t the letter, then N would get x? So we lose?\n\nIt\'s complicated.\n\nBut note: we know A is at position3? So if we don\'t put A at position3, then we get:\n- If we put A elsewhere, then position3: we put a different letter? Then that letter might be wrong? And A: if put at, say, position2, then because the secret has A at position3? Then we should get - for A at position2? And position3: the letter we put might be wrong? So we get feedback: a letter at position3 that is not A -> x? \n\nTherefore, to avoid confusion? I think putting A at position3 is safe? Because we get ✓ for A? And that tells us nothing new? Or it reconfirms? Similarly E at5? Then we focus on the other positions? \n\nTherefore, the safe approach: use a word with A at3 and E at5? With new letters elsewhere.\n\nSo, CRANE: C at1, R at2, N at4? And we test C,R,N? \n\nAnother word: ""ORATE""? But T is eliminated? So no.\n\n""MANGE"": M A N G E → but pattern: M(1), A(2 -> but we put at 2? Not 3)? Position1:M, position2:A, position3:N, position4:G, position5:E? Then A at2? We would get - for A? But secret A at3? Then we get feedback: M(?), A(-), N(?), G(?), E(✓)? Because E at5? And then position3: N? That might be x? So it could be? \n\nBut I think CRANE is simpler? \n\nOther words: \n- CHASE? But S is eliminated? So no.\n- PHASE? S? Also S? Invalid? \n- ""CAUSE""? S? Invalid? \n- ""PRIDE""? But I is? Pattern: P R I D E → but no A? So doesn\'t have A? Then position3: we put I? Which might be wrong? So we expect x? So waste? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with CRANE? But let me check if there are other options? \n\n""BRAVE"": B R A V E → V? V is less common? \n\n""GRACE"": G R A C E → C? Also? But wait, GRACE: G R A C E → pattern: G(1), R(2), A(3), C(4), E(5)? And avoid S,L,T? Yes? Letters: G,R,C? So two of CRANE? \n\nOR ""PRICE""?: Doesn\'t have A? \n\nActually, CRANE is fine? \n\nBut note: CRANE was used in the example? But it\'s a valid word? \n\nSo, I\'ll guess CRANE? \n\nBut wait: another word: ""OZONE""? But Z is rare? Not common? \n\n""CRANE"" has C,R,N? \n\nBut also, we can consider ""DRAKE""? D R A K E → D,R,K \n\nOr ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated? \n\nYes, avoid T.\n\nSo CRANE seems good? \n\nFinal choice: CRANE? \n\nBut let\'s see: if the secret was, for example, ""GRAPE"", then? Or maybe we need to test more vowels? \n\nAnyway, I think CRANE is a solid second guess? \n\nSo next guess: CRANE\n\nReturn: <guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""SLATE"": \n- S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word has \'A\' in position 3 and \'E\' in position 5 (since they received ✓).\n- The letters S, L, and T are **not** in the secret word at all (since they received x).\n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern is: _ _ A _ E\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.\n- Must avoid S, L, T entirely (as they are not in the word).\n- Should introduce new, common letters to maximize information gain for the unknown positions (1, 2, and 4).\n\nConsidering these:\n- The word ""CRANE"" fits perfectly: C in position 1, R in position 2, N in position 4, with A at 3 and E at 5.\n- It avoids S, L, T.\n- It tests three new common letters (C, R, N) in key positions.\n\nOther options (like BRAKE or FRAME) were also considered, but ""CRANE"" has higher-frequency letters and is a strong second guess to gather feedback efficiently.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two rounds of feedback:\n1. Guess 1: SLATE -> S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)\n2. Guess 2: CRANE -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- From Guess 1 and 2, we can confirm:\n  - Position 3: A (correct and fixed)\n  - Position 5: E (correct and fixed)\n  - Letters not in word: S, L, T from Guess 1; and now from Guess 2: C, R, N are also not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E\n\nAnd the missing letters must not be: S, L, T, C, R, N\n\nNow, we need to consider what letters are still possible.\n\nSince we tested: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N (from both guesses)\n\nWe know A and E are in the word but fixed at their positions. So the other letters must be different.\n\nWe have used 9 letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, N.\n\nThe English alphabet has 26 letters, so many more possible.\n\nBut we must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has the form: letter1, letter2, A, letter4, E.\n\nAnd we need letter1, letter2, letter4 to be letters not yet tested? Well, we have tested some that are eliminated.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we should:\n- Keep A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n- Avoid the eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N.\n- Choose new letters for positions 1, 2, and 4 that are common and likely in the word.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know what letters are in the word? Only A and E? So we have to test.\n\nPossible common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to choose three new letters to test.\n\nWe should form a valid English word of the pattern: ? ? A ? E\n\nAvoiding S,L,T,C,R,N.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""GAZED""? But ""Z"" is less common? And pattern: G A Z E D → wait, position 3: Z? No, we need position 3: A? Not present? We must have A at 3.\n\nPattern must be: [1][2]A[4]E\n\nSo, possibilities:\n\n- ""BAKED"": B(1), A(2? No: positions: B at1, A at2, K at3? But we need A at 3? So: B A ? BUT no: ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D → that doesn\'t have A at position 3? Position 3 is K.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A: so words like ? ? A ? E\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""MAKER"": M A K E R → positions: 1:M, 2:A? No: let\'s spell positions: \n  Position1: M\n  Position2: A? But we need position 3: A? That would require the word to have A as the third letter? So:\n  For example, ""BLADE"": B-L-A-D-E → pattern: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:D, 5:E → yes!\n  But L is eliminated? Because from guess1: L was x? So L is not in the word? Therefore, BLADE has L? Invalid? \n  We cannot use any word with L? Or T? Etc.\n\nThus, must avoid L.\n\nAnother word: ""SHADE""? But S is eliminated? And H? H at position2? But ""SHADE"": S-H-A-D-E → S is bad? Eliminated.\n\n""GRAPE"": G-R-A-P-E → positions: 1:G, 2:R, 3:A, 4:P, 5:E? Perfect? But R is eliminated? From guess2: R was x? So R is not in the word? Therefore, cannot use R? ""GRAPE"" has R? So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRAVE"": B-R-A-V-E → R? Bad? R is eliminated.\n\nTherefore, avoid R.\n\nNow, possible words:\n\nWhat words fit ? ? A ? E:\n\nWith common letters:\n\nFor example, ""KAZOO""? Not ending with E? Must end with E.\n\n""IMAGE"": I-M-A-G-E → pattern: 1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E? Avoids S,L,T,C,R,N? Yes: letters I, M, G? All not tested? ""IMAGE"" is a valid word? Yes? Like a picture? But let\'s confirm: I-M-A-G-E → that\'s 5 letters? Yes? So it works? But we have to be careful: what letters does it use? I, M, A, G, E? Avoids the bad letters? Yes? \n\nAnother word: ""PAVED"": P-A-V-E-D → but position 3: V? No: P(1), A(2)? Then position 3: V? So pattern wrong? \n\n""FIADE""? Not a word? \n\n""DIANE""? D-I-A-N-E → positions:1:D,2:I,3:A,4:N,5:E? But N is eliminated? From guess2: N(x)? So can\'t use N? \n\n""MAPLE"": M-A-P-L-E → but L is eliminated? Bad? \n\n""GAFFE"": G-A-F-F-E → pattern:1:G,2:A? Position 3: F? Not A? Pattern wrong? \n\n""AGAPE"": A-G-A-P-E → but first letter A? So: positions:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E? But we are putting A at position1? Then if the secret word has A at position3? We should get - for A at position1? And at position3: we put A? So we also put A at3? This might be confusing? But technically? Also using A twice? \n\nBut feedback: \nPosition1: A? Since the secret has A only at position3? So it should get -? \nPosition3: A? ✓? \nBut that is possible? \n\nBut is AGAPE a word? Yes? Meaning? \n\nHowever, avoiding bad letters: AGAPE? Letters: A, G, A, P, E → so we are repeating A? And E? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? We are putting G and P? \n\nBut also, we know A is at position3? So putting A at position1: then we expect:\n\n- Position1: A -> ? Because A is in the word? But at wrong position? So -?\n- Position3: A -> ✓?\n- Position2: G -> ? not tested?\n- Position4: P -> not tested?\n- Position5: E -> ✓?\n\nSo we get feedback for G and P? And also confirm A at3? \n\nBut we are using one of the guesses? So AGAPE is a possibility? \n\nBut let\'s list words that are valid: \n\nPattern [1][2]A[4]E\n\nAnd [1][2][4] must not be S,L,T,C,R,N? And the letters must be untested? \n\nAnother word: ""WAVED"": W-A-V-E-D → but no: position3 is V? Pattern wrong? \n\nWe need words like: \n\n- ""IMAGE"": as I said earlier? I-M-A-G-E? Yes? \n  Positions:1:I, 2:M, 3:A, 4:G, 5:E -> avoid bad letters? I,M,G? Not tested? \n  Word: IMAGE? Valid? Yes? \n\n- ""QUAKE"": Q-U-A-K-E? Positions:1:Q,2:U,3:A,4:K,5:E -> avoid bad letters? Q,U,K are new? \n  But Q and U are less common? \n\n- ""OATEN"": O-A-T-E-N -> T and N are bad: T eliminated? N eliminated? \n\n- ""DAMME"": Not standard? \n\n- ""FAIRE"": Old English? Not modern? \n\n""IMAGE"" seems good? \n\nAnother: ""BRAES""? Plural of brae? But not? And S? Avoid? \n\n""CHARD""? Not ending with E? Different pattern? \n\n""HAVEN"": H-A-V-E-N -> N? But N eliminated? \n\n""GAMED"": G-A-M-E-D -> position3: M? Not A? \n\nBack to IMAGE? \n\n""IMATE""? Not a word? And T? Bad? \n\nSo IMAGE is a good candidate? \n\nBut what about ""PAYED""? P-A-Y-E-D? Not pattern? Position? P(1),A(2),Y(3),E(4),D(5) -> position3 is Y? Not A? Wrong? \n\nWe must have A at position3? So the words must be XYA?E? So ending with E? \n\nAnother common word: ""ABATE""? But T? Bad? And A not at3? \n\n""BEAKE""? Not a word? \n\n""IMAGE"" appears to be solid? \n\nAnother: ""MAGUE""? Not common? \n\nOr ""AGATE""? T bad? \n\nSo I think IMAGE is acceptable? \n\nPerhaps ""VAGUE"": V-A-G-U-E? Position3: G? Not A? No? \n\n""VAUDE""? Not? \n\nTherefore, let\'s choose IMAGE: it has I, M, G? And we haven\'t tested these? \n\nSo next guess: IMAGE? \n\nBut note: IMAGE? \n\nPattern: I, M, A, G, E? Yes? \n\nSo <guess>IMAGE</guess>? \n\nBut let me confirm feedback? \n\nSecret must be ? ? A ? E? \n\nYes? \n\nWill IMAGE work? \n\nPerhaps ""PAVE""? Not 5 letters? \n\n""SAVEE""? Not? \n\nSo IMAGE is a word? As in icon or picture? \n\nYes? \n\nFinal decision: IMAGE? \n\nBut I\'m considering: what if ""PLAGE""? But L? Bad? \n\nSo? \n\nBut IMAGE? \n\nMaybe ""BAKED""? Pattern wrong? \n\nPerhaps change? \n\nAnother word: ""GAWKS""? No E? \n\nI think IMAGE is our best? \n\nSo guess: IMAGE? \n\nReturn: <guess>IMAGE</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)**  \n  This confirms:\n  - Position 3 must be \'A\' (correct and fixed).\n  - Position 5 must be \'E\' (correct and fixed).\n  - Letters S, L, and T are NOT in the secret word.\n\n- **Guess 2: CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  This confirms:\n  - Positions 3 and 5 remain fixed (\'A\' and \'E\').\n  - Letters C, R, and N are also NOT in the secret word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `[ ] [ ] A [ ] E`\n- **Eliminated letters** (not in the word at all): S, L, T, C, R, N.\n- **Unknown positions**: Positions 1, 2, and 4 must be filled with letters not yet tested or eliminated.

We are given three guesses with feedback:
- Guess 1: SLATE → S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
- Guess 2: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
- Guess 3: IMAGE → I(x), M(x), A(✓), G(-), E(✓)

**Step-by-step interpretation:**

1. **Fixed positions from previous feedback:**
   - Position 3: Always A (since A(✓) in all guesses).
   - Position 5: Always E (since E(✓) in all guesses).

2. **Eliminated letters (x means not in the word):**
   - From Guess 1: S, L, T
   - From Guess 2: C, R, N
   - From Guess 3: I, M
   - Therefore, the secret word does not contain: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M

3. **Additional insight from Guess 3:**
   - Feedback for IMAGE: G(-) → This means G is in the secret word, but not in position 4. Since position 4 was guessed as G, but it's wrong, G must be in another position.

4. **Pattern summary:**
   - Secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E
   - letter1 and letter2 cannot be any of the eliminated letters (and we just learned I and M are eliminated).
   - letter4 cannot be G (since we got a “-” for G meaning it exists but not here), so G must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are fixed).

5. **Constraints:**
   - G is in the word, and it's in position 1 or 2 (because position 4 is incorrect, and positions 3/A, 5/E are fixed).
   - letter4 (position 4) must be a new letter that is not eliminated and not G, since G is misplaced in position 4.

6. **Available letters:**
   - Eliminated: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M → Total 8 letters.
   - We have G must be in the word at position 1 or 2.
   - We need two more letters for the remaining positions? Or perhaps duplicates? But G is only once? Note the feedback has no other ✓ or -, so we don’t know about duplicates. But G is confirmed present? Therefore? 
   - The word has exactly 5 letters: pattern: [position1] [position2] A [position4] E
   - Position1 and position2 must be letters that are not eliminated? And position4 must be a letter not eliminated? And not G? Because position4 was G and gave -, so position4 is not G.

Therefore, we must:
- Include G in position 1 or 2.
- Avoid all eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, form a word: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

But G must be either letter1 or letter2? 

Also, note: we don’t know if there are other unknown letters? So for letter4, we need to pick a new letter to test? And for the other position? We have to put G and a new letter?

Two cases:
- Case 1: G at position1 → pattern: G [letter2] A [letter4] E
- Case 2: G at position2 → pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E

We must choose one? And then select the other letter? 

But also, letter4 must be a new letter? Avoid eliminated letters? 

For the next guess, we can try to get more information? Let's consider common words.

Possible words for each case:

**Case 1: G at position1?**  
Words starting with G? Avoid bad letters? Ending with E? With A at position3? And the letter2 and letter4 available?  
Examples:  
- ""GRAZE""? But R and Z? But R is eliminated?   
- ""GLADE""? L eliminated?  
- ""GOOSE""? Not pattern?  
- ""GAUGE""? G at1, A at2? Then position3: U? Not A? Pattern wrong? Must be G ? A ? E → position3 is A?  
So: ""G???E"" with A at3? So: G [position2] A [position4] E?  

Valid words?  
- ""GAFFE""? But F twice? Pattern: G A F F E → position1:G, position2:A, position3:F? Not A? Wrong?  
We must have A only at position3? So position2 cannot be A?  
Therefore, position2 must be a consonant? Not A? Because A is at position3?  

Pattern: G [letter] A [letter] E? Only two possibilities?  

For instance, ""GUAVE""? Not valid?  
""AGAPE""? But we have G at position1? ""A G A P E""? Pattern:1:A,2:G? But we want G at1?  
No? This is different?  
List:  
""GAWPE""? Not a word?  
""GAMED""? M eliminated?  
""GAMBE""? M bad?  
""CAGE""? Not?  

Perhaps ""GABLE""? But L eliminated?  
""GADBE""? No?  

Difficult?  
Another: ""GAUZE""? U and Z? Pattern: G A U Z E → position1:G,2:A → but then position3:U? Not A? Must have A at3?  
To have A at position3? Then: G [letter] A [letter] E? So the second letter must be something before A at position3?  
Examples:  
- ""GHAZE""? H and Z? But G H A Z E → checks: positions?  
  Position1: G, position2: H, position3: A, position4: Z, position5: E? Yes?  
  Valid word? ""Ghaze""? Not common? Unlikely?  
- ""GRADE""? R eliminated?  
- ""GNAVE""? N eliminated?  
- ""GLAZE""? L eliminated?  

So? Not many common words?  

**Case 2: G at position2 → pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E**  
This might be better?  
So: ? G A ? E?  
Available: common letters?  

Examples:  
- ""OGA?E""? ""OGA""? Not really?  
- ""UGA?E""? ""UGARE""? No?  
- ""AGAPE""? But A at position1? Then G at2? Then A at3? Then P at4? E at5?  
""AGAPE"": A G A P E → pattern:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E?  
But is ""AGAPE"" a valid word? Yes? Therefore?  
However, note: we don’t know if A appears multiple times? Also, position1 A would be - because A is fixed at position3? Only? Or duplicate?  

But feedback in guess3: for G at position4? We got - meaning G exists elsewhere? So in AGAPE? We put G at position2? That might be correct?  

Another word: ""BGAIE""? Invalid?  

Or ""PGA""? Not?  

Common choices: ""AGAPE"":  
- Position1: A? But the secret word has A at position3? So we would not have A at position1? So for ""AGAPE"":  
- Position1: A? Since A exists at position3? But letter A at position1? Should be -?  
- Position2: G? We know G is in the word? So if G is at position2? Then it could be correct?  
- Position3: A? Correct?   
- Position4: P? Not known?  
- Position5: E? Correct?  

So we can?  
But note: we have eliminated A? Actually, A we already tested? But we don’t know if there are duplicate A?  

Another word: ""WAGE""? 4 letters?  
""UGAPE""? Not common?  

Perhaps ""OGATE""? T bad?  

Another valid word: ""AGATE""? But T bad? Eliminated?  

""ABATE""? T eliminated?  

So ""AGAPE"" seems valid?  

Also ""VGA""? Not.  

Therefore, we can use ""AGAPE""? But we have to consider?  
We haven’t tested P?  

But let’s see?  

Another possibility: ""PAGE""? Not 5 letters?  
""PAGED""? P A G E D → pattern:1:P,2:A,3:G? Not A? Wrong?  

Therefore?  
Only ""AGAPE"" fits? Or are there others?  
""AGAVE"": A-G-A-V-E? Pattern:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:V,5:E? Also valid?  
Meaning: a plant?  

Similarly?  

But note: position4 in our guess must be a new letter?  

So for AGAPE or AGAVE?  
AGAPE: letters A, G, A, P, E? But A and E are known? So test G? and P?  
Similarly AGAVE: A, G, A, V, E?  

But AGAPE:  
- It reuses A?  
But we know A exists?  

So let’s choose AGAPE?  
But note: pattern?  
However, we are confident G must be in the word? So putting G at position2? Which is necessary?  

Now, what about the feedback for position1: if we put A at position1? Then we expect -? Or if duplicate A? But unknown?  

But it might work?  

Another word: ""DGAPE""? Not.  

So I think AGAPE is a legitimate guess?  
But AGAVE might be better? Because V is new?  

Both P and V are new letters?  

But AGAPE is more common? Or AGAVE?  

But in word games, AGAPE is acceptable?  

Alternatively, is there a word like ""KGASE""? No?  

Therefore, AGAPE or AGAVE?  

Let me look for alternatives:  
""BGATE"": T? Bad?  
""FGAPE""? Not.  
""OKAGE""? K? Valid? But pattern: O K A G E → position1:O,2:K,3:A,4:G,5:E? But we need to guess letter1? and letter2?  
For position4? If we put G? But the secret word has G? But position4 might be G? But feedback in image? G was in position4 and gave '-' meaning G is not at position4? So why put G at position4 again? We shouldn’t?  

Therefore, in the new word for position4? We must not be G? We need a different letter?  

Therefore, in AGAPE: position4 is P? Which is new?  
In AGAVE: position4 is V? New?  

So either?  
But AGAPE: position4 P?  
AGAVE: V?  

But both are uncommon? But valid?  

We could try ""HGAZE""? Not?  

Another word: ""ABOVE""? B O V E? No A at position3?  

No?  

Therefore, we'll choose AGAPE?  

But let me see?  

Actually, the word we need must use G at position1? or position2?  
And we have cases?  

From Guess 3: G(-) at position4? So we know G must be elsewhere?  

Therefore, in AGAPE:  
Pattern: A G A P E  
We expect:  
Position1: A -> If the secret word has one A only at position3? Then this should be '-', because A exists at position3? So wrong position?  
Position2: G -> We know G is in the word? If this is the correct position? Then it could be '✓'? Or if not, then '-'?  
But if G is at position2? Then it would be ✓?  

But we don’t know?  

Position3: A -> ✓  
Position4: P -> Not known? x? -? or?  
Position5: E -> ✓  

So AGAPE tests:  
- Whether A also appears at position1?  
- Whether G is at position2?  
- What letter is at position4?  

Similarly, if we choose a word with G at position1? Like ""GHAZE"" – invalid?  

So AGAPE might be the only common?  

Another word: ""OGA"": not?  
""UGA"": not?  

Therefore, I’ll go with AGAPE?  

But note? AGAPE has almost no vowels? But it has A and E?  

Perhaps ""EGRET""? But R? Bad?  

I think AGAPE is acceptable?  

But AGAVE is also?  

But AGAVE: the letter V is less frequent?  

AGAPE uses P? Which is common?  

Therefore?  

But in AGAPE, we are repeating A? So it might not be efficient? But we need to test if G is at position2? And also get P tested?  

Alternatively, another possibility:  
We might not want to reuse A? But we have to? Unless we can form a word without A at position1? But we don’t know if A is at position1?  

But we think the secret word has A only at position3? But we don’t know?  

So AGAPE tests that?  

Therefore?  

Guess: AGAPE  

Return: <guess>AGAPE</guess>?  

But I have doubt?  

Perhaps ""KHAKI""? No E?  

Or ""GAMMA""? No E?  

Therefore, AGAPE.  

But let's think of letters?  
We must avoid: S,L,T,C,R,N,I,M?  
In AGAPE: A,G,P? G and P are untested? A is known? E known?  

Yes?  

So final choice?  

If we avoid A at position1? Then we need a word with G at position1 or position2? And no A at position1?  

For example:  
Pattern: [not A] [not A?] A [G not here] E?  
With G at either position1 or 2?  

Case: G at position1, without A?  
So: G [letter2] A [letter4] E?  
With letter2 ≠ A?  

Possible?  
For instance: ""GHA?"" → ""GHATE""? T bad?  
""GHALE""? L bad?  
""GIFTE""? T bad?  

Therefore?  
""GOATE""? O,A,T? T bad?  
""GVAE""? No?  

So common words?  

Case 2: position2 G, and position1 a letter?  
Pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E?  
With letter1 ≠ A?  

Examples:  
- ""U G A P E""? ""UGAPE""? Not valid?  
- ""P G A P E""? ""PGAPE""? Not?  
- ""V G A Z E""? ""VGAZE""? No?  
- ""B G A T E""? T bad?  
- ""D G A F E""? ""DGAFE""? Not a word?  
- ""W G A B E""? ""WGABE""? No?  

Therefore, not many?  
Thus, AGAPE is the only valid common choice?  
Similarly AGAVE?  

""AGAVE"" is more widely accepted?  

Therefore, between AGAPE and AGAVE?  

But in AGAPE: the letter P vs AGAVE: V?  
We don’t prefer?  

Or ""AGAZE""? Not valid?  

Therefore?  

Or ""AGLEY""? L bad?  

Conclusion: Guess ""AGAPE"" as an initial choice?  

But note: ""AGAPE"" is in the dictionary?  

Yes?  

So I’ll go?  
</think>
Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Pattern Confirmation**: Secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 fixed as 'A' and 'E').
- **Eliminated Letters**: S, L, T (from Guess 1), C, R, N (from Guess 2), I, M (from Guess 3) → **Cannot use these.**
- **Critical Insight from Guess 3**: Feedback for IMAGE → `G(-)` means:
  - 'G' is **in the secret word**, but **not in position 4**.
  - 'G' must therefore appear in position **1 or 2** (the only remaining unknown positions).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Maintain 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
- Include 'G' in position 1 or 2 (required by Guess 3 feedback).
- Avoid all eliminated letters and test new letters for unknown positions.
- Given constraints, **AGAPE** (A-G-A-P-E) is a strong choice:
  - Position 1: 'A' → Tests if 'A' is duplicated elsewhere (expect ""-"" if it is).
  - Position 2: 'G' → Tests if 'G' belongs here (possible ""✓"" or ""-"").
  - Position 4: 'P' → New high-frequency letter to test.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and satisfies pattern `_ _ A _ E`.

<guess>AGAPE</guess>",AGAPE,"We are given three guesses with feedback:
- Guess 1: SLATE → S(x), L(x), A(✓), T(x), E(✓)
- Guess 2: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
- Guess 3: IMAGE → I(x), M(x), A(✓), G(-), E(✓)

**Step-by-step interpretation:**

1. **Fixed positions from previous feedback:**
   - Position 3: Always A (since A(✓) in all guesses).
   - Position 5: Always E (since E(✓) in all guesses).

2. **Eliminated letters (x means not in the word):**
   - From Guess 1: S, L, T
   - From Guess 2: C, R, N
   - From Guess 3: I, M
   - Therefore, the secret word does not contain: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M

3. **Additional insight from Guess 3:**
   - Feedback for IMAGE: G(-) → This means G is in the secret word, but not in position 4. Since position 4 was guessed as G, but it's wrong, G must be in another position.

4. **Pattern summary:**
   - Secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E
   - letter1 and letter2 cannot be any of the eliminated letters (and we just learned I and M are eliminated).
   - letter4 cannot be G (since we got a “-” for G meaning it exists but not here), so G must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are fixed).

5. **Constraints:**
   - G is in the word, and it's in position 1 or 2 (because position 4 is incorrect, and positions 3/A, 5/E are fixed).
   - letter4 (position 4) must be a new letter that is not eliminated and not G, since G is misplaced in position 4.

6. **Available letters:**
   - Eliminated: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M → Total 8 letters.
   - We have G must be in the word at position 1 or 2.
   - We need two more letters for the remaining positions? Or perhaps duplicates? But G is only once? Note the feedback has no other ✓ or -, so we don’t know about duplicates. But G is confirmed present? Therefore? 
   - The word has exactly 5 letters: pattern: [position1] [position2] A [position4] E
   - Position1 and position2 must be letters that are not eliminated? And position4 must be a letter not eliminated? And not G? Because position4 was G and gave -, so position4 is not G.

Therefore, we must:
- Include G in position 1 or 2.
- Avoid all eliminated letters: S, L, T, C, R, N, I, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, form a word: [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] E

But G must be either letter1 or letter2? 

Also, note: we don’t know if there are other unknown letters? So for letter4, we need to pick a new letter to test? And for the other position? We have to put G and a new letter?

Two cases:
- Case 1: G at position1 → pattern: G [letter2] A [letter4] E
- Case 2: G at position2 → pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E

We must choose one? And then select the other letter? 

But also, letter4 must be a new letter? Avoid eliminated letters? 

For the next guess, we can try to get more information? Let's consider common words.

Possible words for each case:

**Case 1: G at position1?**  
Words starting with G? Avoid bad letters? Ending with E? With A at position3? And the letter2 and letter4 available?  
Examples:  
- ""GRAZE""? But R and Z? But R is eliminated?   
- ""GLADE""? L eliminated?  
- ""GOOSE""? Not pattern?  
- ""GAUGE""? G at1, A at2? Then position3: U? Not A? Pattern wrong? Must be G ? A ? E → position3 is A?  
So: ""G???E"" with A at3? So: G [position2] A [position4] E?  

Valid words?  
- ""GAFFE""? But F twice? Pattern: G A F F E → position1:G, position2:A, position3:F? Not A? Wrong?  
We must have A only at position3? So position2 cannot be A?  
Therefore, position2 must be a consonant? Not A? Because A is at position3?  

Pattern: G [letter] A [letter] E? Only two possibilities?  

For instance, ""GUAVE""? Not valid?  
""AGAPE""? But we have G at position1? ""A G A P E""? Pattern:1:A,2:G? But we want G at1?  
No? This is different?  
List:  
""GAWPE""? Not a word?  
""GAMED""? M eliminated?  
""GAMBE""? M bad?  
""CAGE""? Not?  

Perhaps ""GABLE""? But L eliminated?  
""GADBE""? No?  

Difficult?  
Another: ""GAUZE""? U and Z? Pattern: G A U Z E → position1:G,2:A → but then position3:U? Not A? Must have A at3?  
To have A at position3? Then: G [letter] A [letter] E? So the second letter must be something before A at position3?  
Examples:  
- ""GHAZE""? H and Z? But G H A Z E → checks: positions?  
  Position1: G, position2: H, position3: A, position4: Z, position5: E? Yes?  
  Valid word? ""Ghaze""? Not common? Unlikely?  
- ""GRADE""? R eliminated?  
- ""GNAVE""? N eliminated?  
- ""GLAZE""? L eliminated?  

So? Not many common words?  

**Case 2: G at position2 → pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E**  
This might be better?  
So: ? G A ? E?  
Available: common letters?  

Examples:  
- ""OGA?E""? ""OGA""? Not really?  
- ""UGA?E""? ""UGARE""? No?  
- ""AGAPE""? But A at position1? Then G at2? Then A at3? Then P at4? E at5?  
""AGAPE"": A G A P E → pattern:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:P,5:E?  
But is ""AGAPE"" a valid word? Yes? Therefore?  
However, note: we don’t know if A appears multiple times? Also, position1 A would be - because A is fixed at position3? Only? Or duplicate?  

But feedback in guess3: for G at position4? We got - meaning G exists elsewhere? So in AGAPE? We put G at position2? That might be correct?  

Another word: ""BGAIE""? Invalid?  

Or ""PGA""? Not?  

Common choices: ""AGAPE"":  
- Position1: A? But the secret word has A at position3? So we would not have A at position1? So for ""AGAPE"":  
- Position1: A? Since A exists at position3? But letter A at position1? Should be -?  
- Position2: G? We know G is in the word? So if G is at position2? Then it could be correct?  
- Position3: A? Correct?   
- Position4: P? Not known?  
- Position5: E? Correct?  

So we can?  
But note: we have eliminated A? Actually, A we already tested? But we don’t know if there are duplicate A?  

Another word: ""WAGE""? 4 letters?  
""UGAPE""? Not common?  

Perhaps ""OGATE""? T bad?  

Another valid word: ""AGATE""? But T bad? Eliminated?  

""ABATE""? T eliminated?  

So ""AGAPE"" seems valid?  

Also ""VGA""? Not.  

Therefore, we can use ""AGAPE""? But we have to consider?  
We haven’t tested P?  

But let’s see?  

Another possibility: ""PAGE""? Not 5 letters?  
""PAGED""? P A G E D → pattern:1:P,2:A,3:G? Not A? Wrong?  

Therefore?  
Only ""AGAPE"" fits? Or are there others?  
""AGAVE"": A-G-A-V-E? Pattern:1:A,2:G,3:A,4:V,5:E? Also valid?  
Meaning: a plant?  

Similarly?  

But note: position4 in our guess must be a new letter?  

So for AGAPE or AGAVE?  
AGAPE: letters A, G, A, P, E? But A and E are known? So test G? and P?  
Similarly AGAVE: A, G, A, V, E?  

But AGAPE:  
- It reuses A?  
But we know A exists?  

So let’s choose AGAPE?  
But note: pattern?  
However, we are confident G must be in the word? So putting G at position2? Which is necessary?  

Now, what about the feedback for position1: if we put A at position1? Then we expect -? Or if duplicate A? But unknown?  

But it might work?  

Another word: ""DGAPE""? Not.  

So I think AGAPE is a legitimate guess?  
But AGAVE might be better? Because V is new?  

Both P and V are new letters?  

But AGAPE is more common? Or AGAVE?  

But in word games, AGAPE is acceptable?  

Alternatively, is there a word like ""KGASE""? No?  

Therefore, AGAPE or AGAVE?  

Let me look for alternatives:  
""BGATE"": T? Bad?  
""FGAPE""? Not.  
""OKAGE""? K? Valid? But pattern: O K A G E → position1:O,2:K,3:A,4:G,5:E? But we need to guess letter1? and letter2?  
For position4? If we put G? But the secret word has G? But position4 might be G? But feedback in image? G was in position4 and gave '-' meaning G is not at position4? So why put G at position4 again? We shouldn’t?  

Therefore, in the new word for position4? We must not be G? We need a different letter?  

Therefore, in AGAPE: position4 is P? Which is new?  
In AGAVE: position4 is V? New?  

So either?  
But AGAPE: position4 P?  
AGAVE: V?  

But both are uncommon? But valid?  

We could try ""HGAZE""? Not?  

Another word: ""ABOVE""? B O V E? No A at position3?  

No?  

Therefore, we'll choose AGAPE?  

But let me see?  

Actually, the word we need must use G at position1? or position2?  
And we have cases?  

From Guess 3: G(-) at position4? So we know G must be elsewhere?  

Therefore, in AGAPE:  
Pattern: A G A P E  
We expect:  
Position1: A -> If the secret word has one A only at position3? Then this should be '-', because A exists at position3? So wrong position?  
Position2: G -> We know G is in the word? If this is the correct position? Then it could be '✓'? Or if not, then '-'?  
But if G is at position2? Then it would be ✓?  

But we don’t know?  

Position3: A -> ✓  
Position4: P -> Not known? x? -? or?  
Position5: E -> ✓  

So AGAPE tests:  
- Whether A also appears at position1?  
- Whether G is at position2?  
- What letter is at position4?  

Similarly, if we choose a word with G at position1? Like ""GHAZE"" – invalid?  

So AGAPE might be the only common?  

Another word: ""OGA"": not?  
""UGA"": not?  

Therefore, I’ll go with AGAPE?  

But note? AGAPE has almost no vowels? But it has A and E?  

Perhaps ""EGRET""? But R? Bad?  

I think AGAPE is acceptable?  

But AGAVE is also?  

But AGAVE: the letter V is less frequent?  

AGAPE uses P? Which is common?  

Therefore?  

But in AGAPE, we are repeating A? So it might not be efficient? But we need to test if G is at position2? And also get P tested?  

Alternatively, another possibility:  
We might not want to reuse A? But we have to? Unless we can form a word without A at position1? But we don’t know if A is at position1?  

But we think the secret word has A only at position3? But we don’t know?  

So AGAPE tests that?  

Therefore?  

Guess: AGAPE  

Return: <guess>AGAPE</guess>?  

But I have doubt?  

Perhaps ""KHAKI""? No E?  

Or ""GAMMA""? No E?  

Therefore, AGAPE.  

But let's think of letters?  
We must avoid: S,L,T,C,R,N,I,M?  
In AGAPE: A,G,P? G and P are untested? A is known? E known?  

Yes?  

So final choice?  

If we avoid A at position1? Then we need a word with G at position1 or position2? And no A at position1?  

For example:  
Pattern: [not A] [not A?] A [G not here] E?  
With G at either position1 or 2?  

Case: G at position1, without A?  
So: G [letter2] A [letter4] E?  
With letter2 ≠ A?  

Possible?  
For instance: ""GHA?"" → ""GHATE""? T bad?  
""GHALE""? L bad?  
""GIFTE""? T bad?  

Therefore?  
""GOATE""? O,A,T? T bad?  
""GVAE""? No?  

So common words?  

Case 2: position2 G, and position1 a letter?  
Pattern: [letter1] G A [letter4] E?  
With letter1 ≠ A?  

Examples:  
- ""U G A P E""? ""UGAPE""? Not valid?  
- ""P G A P E""? ""PGAPE""? Not?  
- ""V G A Z E""? ""VGAZE""? No?  
- ""B G A T E""? T bad?  
- ""D G A F E""? ""DGAFE""? Not a word?  
- ""W G A B E""? ""WGABE""? No?  

Therefore, not many?  
Thus, AGAPE is the only valid common choice?  
Similarly AGAVE?  

""AGAVE"" is more widely accepted?  

Therefore, between AGAPE and AGAVE?  

But in AGAPE: the letter P vs AGAVE: V?  
We don’t prefer?  

Or ""AGAZE""? Not valid?  

Therefore?  

Or ""AGLEY""? L bad?  

Conclusion: Guess ""AGAPE"" as an initial choice?  

But note: ""AGAPE"" is in the dictionary?  

Yes?  

So I’ll go?Based on the accumulated feedback:

- **Pattern Confirmation**: Secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ E` (positions 3 and 5 fixed as 'A' and 'E').
- **Eliminated Letters**: S, L, T (from Guess 1), C, R, N (from Guess 2), I, M (from Guess 3) → **Cannot use these.**
- **Critical Insight from Guess 3**: Feedback for IMAGE → `G(-)` means:

  - 'G' must therefore appear in position **1 or 2** (the only remaining unknown positions).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Maintain 'A' in position 3 and 'E' in position 5.
- Include 'G' in position 1 or 2 (required by Guess 3 feedback).

- Given constraints, **AGAPE** (A-G-A-P-E) is a strong choice:
  - Position 1: 'A' → Tests if 'A' is duplicated elsewhere (expect ""-"" if it is).
  - Position 2: 'G' → Tests if 'G' belongs here (possible ""✓"" or ""-"").
  - Position 4: 'P' → New high-frequency letter to test.
  - Avoids eliminated letters and satisfies pattern `_ _ A _ E`.",Guess 4: AGAPE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(✓) A(✓) P(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
