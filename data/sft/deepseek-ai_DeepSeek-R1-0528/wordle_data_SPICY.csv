We are starting the game. For the first guess, we have no prior information.
 It's common to start with a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""crane"" or ""salet"", but I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it has distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 Let's check: C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.

I'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This provides a balanced mix of letters that often appear in 5-letter English words, which should help gather initial feedback about the secret word's structure. As a first guess, it maximizes the potential information gain across different positions.

First, the secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. For my first guess, I used ""crane"", and the feedback was:

- C: - meaning it's in the word but wrong position
- R: x not in the word
- A: x not in the word
- N: x not in the word
- E: x not in the word

The feedback format is:
- ✓ : correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

So, from the first guess:
- Only C is in the word, but not in the first position (since it got ""-""). Position: I guessed C as the first letter, but it's wrong position, so C must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5 of the secret word. But since R, A, N, E are all not in the word, that means only C is present from ""crane"", and it's not in position 1.

Letters confirmed not in word: R, A, N, E. That means the secret word contains C, but not in the first position, and excludes R, A, N, E.

Letters that are not in secret word: R, A, N, E.

Letters that are in secret word: C (but not in position 1).

Position of C: Since I guessed it in position 1 and it's wrong position, C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to use a word that includes C in a different position and avoids R, A, N, E, and introduces new letters.

I should choose a word that places C not in the first position, since it can't be position 1.

Also, avoid using R, A, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.

Since C is the only known letter to be present, I need to test other common letters.

Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5.

In my next guess, I should put C in one of these positions to see if it's correct or not. Since I don't know which position it belongs in yet, I can place it in a different position and see the feedback.

Let me think of words that start with different letters but contain C, not in position 1.

Possible words: For example, ""lucky"" – but I don't know if L, U, K, Y are in the word. Since I have limited tries, I should choose words with high-frequency letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, etc., but E, A, N are already out from my first guess. E, A, N are not in the word, so I should avoid them.

R is also out.

Remaining vowels: O, U, I, etc.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, etc.

Since C is placed wrongly in position 1, it could be anywhere from 2-5.

But to maximize information, I could choose a word where C is in position 2, for instance.

Let me list possible words.

But I don't have a word list, but I know many 5-letter words.

Another idea: use a word that ends with C or has C in common positions.

For example, words with C in position 2: like ""acted"" but A is out, so no.

A is out, so avoid A.

Similarly, R, N, E are out.

So, possible words: let's start with consonant + vowel + C + consonant + vowel, but need to avoid excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E.

So, letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But C must be in the word, but not in position 1.

In the guess, I can include C in position 2,3,4, or 5.

For second guess, I should place C in position 2 to test if it might be there, or position 3, etc.

I should choose a word that doesn't start with C since C is not in position 1.

So, let's pick a word starting with, say, S or T, which are common.

And include C in position 3 or something.

Also, since E is out, avoid E.

Possible words:

- ""Music"" : M U S I C – letters: M U S I C

C is in position 5, which is one possible spot.

But U and I are vowels, S and M consonants.

- ""Climb"" : but C is first, which we can't do, since C not in position 1.

C cannot be in position 1, so first letter cannot be C.

So, words not starting with C.

""topic"": T O P I C – C at end, position 5.

Letters: T O P I C

All these letters are new except C, but C is in different position.

Then feedback would show if any are in word.

Similarly, ""basic"" but A is out, so avoid.

""optic"": O P T I C – O P T I C

C at position 5.

Another option: ""quick"": Q U I C K – C in position 4.

Q is less common.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple common letters.

Common letters not excluded: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

For example, ""still"": S T I L L – but no C, so I must include C because C is confirmed in the word.

I must include C in the guess since I know it's in the word, but I don't have to for second guess? No, I can guess without C to test other letters, but since I know C is in the word, it might be inefficient not to include it and confirm its position.

Looking at feedback: I know C is in the word but wrong position, so for second guess, if I don't include C, and I get feedback, I might think C is still wrong position or something, but the game tracks overall, but in terms of feedback for the guess.

The feedback is per guess. So if in my second guess I don't include C, but C is in the word, then for that guess, letters not C might be indicated.

But it's better to include C in a possible position to check.

For example, if I put C in position 2, and it gets ✓, then I know position 2 is C.

If it gets -, then C is not in position 2 but still in word.

If I put it and it gets x, that would contradict, but since we know C is in word, it won't get x, but feedback could be - or ✓.

Since C is in the word, any guess that includes C in a position will either get ✓ if correct position or - if wrong position, or if I don't include C, no symbol for C, but C remains confirmed present.

In the feedback for a guess, it only shows for the letters guessed. So if I don't include C, I don't learn anything new about C position.

Whereas if I include C, I can narrow down the position.

So, for efficiency, I should include C in my second guess, and place it in a potential position. Since position 1 is out, I should put it in position 2,3,4 or 5.

Now, common positions for C: it can be first, but we know it's not, or end, like in words ending with C.

But ""c"" is common at end? Not really, many words end with C? Like picnic, but not 5-letter. 5-letter words ending with C: topic, music, ethic, etc.

In ""topic"", C is the 5th letter.

Similarly, ""logic"", ""magic"", etc.

Or C in position 2: like ""scold"", ""scale"" but A is out, so ""scale"" has A.

Avoid A.

""Scope"": S C O P E – E is out.

E is out, so avoid E.

No E, no A, no N, no R.

So, words without R, A, E, N.

Possible word with C: let's consider ""pitch"": P I T C H – C in position 4.

Letters: P I T C H

All new letters.

""witch"": W I T C H – similar.

""light"": L I G H T – no C, but must include C.

I need to include C.

""clutch"" is 6, too long.

5-letter: ""clout"": C L O U T – but C is first position, and we know C not in position 1, so if I put C in position 1, since it's not correct, it will get - or x, but it should get - because C is in word, just wrong position? Position is part of it.

If I put C in position 1 again? The feedback will tell if it's correct position or not.

In guess 1, I put C in position 1 and it was - meaning wrong position.

If I put C again in position 1, it will still be - since position is wrong.

But that doesn't gain new information; I should put C in a different position.

So better to move C to position 2,3,4 or 5.

For example, put C in position 2.

What words have C in position 2? Like ""scalp"", ""scorn"" but R and A out.

""scalp"" has A, ""scorn"" has R, both out.

""scope"" has E out.

""scout"": S C O U T

Letters: S C O U T

C in position 2.

O and U vowels, S,T consonants.

Avoid R,A,N,E.

""block"": B L O C K – C in position 4.

C in position 4.

B, L, O, K.

Oin position 3.

I could choose a word with multiple vowels since A and E are out, O and I and U are good.

Like ""music"": M U S I C – M,U,S,I,C

C in position 5.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C – C in position 5.

G might be less common.

""panic"": but A out.

""optic"": O P T I C - C in position 5, O P T I C.

Letters: O P T I C

All covered.

Now, position of C: since I put it in position 5, if it gets ✓, position 5 is correct; if -, then C is in word but not in position 5, so must be in 2,3, or 4.

If it gets -, then position 5 is wrong for C.

Similarly, if I get feedback on other letters.

But I need to decide.

Another idea: since only C is known, I can prioritize finding C's position.

For instance, put C in position 2.

Possible word: ""scald"" but A out.

""Scud"": only 4 letters. 5-letter needed.

""Scent"" but E out.

""Scowl"": S C O W L – C in position 2.

Letters: S,C,O,W,L

Avoids R,A,N,E.

Acceptable?

Or ""could"": C O U L D – C first position, which we avoid.

I should not put C in position 1.

So ""scowl"" : S C O W L – C position 2.

Similarly, ""scept"", but not common, or ""actin"" but A out.

""stick"": S T I C K – C in position 4.

S,T,I,C,K.

K is less common.

""quick"": Q U I C K – Q less common.

Better to use common letters.

I think ""music"" or ""topic"" is fine.

Since E is out, words ending with IC might be common.

""topic"": T O P I C

Letters: T O P I C

Position: T1 O2 P3 I4 C5

C in 5.

Now, for feedback, if C is correct position, I know, else not.

Also, I get info on T,O,P,I.

Similarly, if any are in word or not.

Another word: ""chill"" C first position not good.

""pical"" not common.

I'll go with ""topic"" for guess 2.

But in ""topic"", C is last, position 5.

Another option: ""slice"" but E out.

""slice"" has E? S L I C E – E, out.

So no.

""mucus"" but doesn't end with C, M U C U S – C position 3.

Letters M,U,C,U,S – U twice, less efficient? But valid word.

But ""music"" might be better: M U S I C – unique letters.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C.

""basic"" B A S I C but A out.

So avoid A.

""cynic"" C first position.

Not good.

I think ""music"" is good: M U S I C.

Position: M1 U2 S3 I4 C5

C in position 5.

I could place C in position 3 or 4 to avoid end.

For example, ""picky"" P I C K Y – C in position 3.

But Y is at end.

Or ""flesh"" no C.

Include C: "" fetch"" F E T C H – E out.

Not.

""patch"" A out.

Not.

""watch"" W A T C H – A out.

Same.

""pitch"" P I T C H – C in 4: P1 I2 T3 C4 H5

That works: letters P,I,T,C,H

All covered.

Similarly, ""witch"" W I T C H

But W might be less common.

P is common.

So ""pitch"" could be good.

Or ""ditch"" D I T C H.

But D.

No preference, P is fine.

Back to ""topic"" or ""pitch"".

In ""pitch"", C is position 4.

In ""music"", C position 5.

I'll choose ""pitch"" because it has C in position 4, and letters P,I,T,H.

But H is common, T, I, P.

Also, ""light"" no C.

I think ""pitch"" is fine.

So for second guess, I'll use ""pitch"".

But let's confirm letter exclusion: excluded R,A,N,E.

""pitch"" has P,I,T,C,H none of which are excluded.

C is included, position 4.

If in feedback, C gets ✓, position 4 is correct.

If -, then position 4 is wrong.

Similarly for others.

Now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.

First, I should think step by step, as per instructions.

Thought process:
- From first guess ""crane"", feedback: C is in word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E are not in word.
- Secret word contains C in positions 2,3,4, or 5, and excludes R,A,N,E.
- For second guess, choose a word that includes C not in position 1, and avoids R,A,N,E, while introducing new common letters to test positions.
- Selected ""pitch"" as guess: P,I,T,C,H with C in position 4 to test.
- If C is position 4, it will be ✓; if not, still in word.
- Also tests P,I,T,H which are new letters.

Now, output format should be <guess>pitch</guess>
</think>
Based on the first guess ""crane"" and its feedback (C is in the word but not in position 1; R, A, N, E are not in the word), the second guess must include C in a different position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid using R, A, N, or E. The goal is to test the position of C while introducing new common letters for further information.

- C must be in the word but not position 1, so I avoid starting with C.
- I excluded R, A, N, E from possible letters.
- I chose ""pitch"" as the guess because:
  - It places C in position 4, which is one of the possible positions. This will help narrow down C's location (if feedback shows C correct, position 4 is solved; if wrong position, C is in 2, 3, or 5).
  - It introduces new common consonants (P, T, H) and a vowel (I), which are high-frequency and can provide valuable feedback.
  - The word uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N, E).

<guess>pitch</guess>",pitch,"First, the secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. For my first guess, I used ""crane"", and the feedback was:

But it's better to include C in a possible position to check.

For example, if I put C in position 2, and it gets ✓, then I know position 2 is C.

If it gets -, then C is not in position 2 but still in word.

If I put it and it gets x, that would contradict, but since we know C is in word, it won't get x, but feedback could be - or ✓.

Since C is in the word, any guess that includes C in a position will either get ✓ if correct position or - if wrong position, or if I don't include C, no symbol for C, but C remains confirmed present.

In the feedback for a guess, it only shows for the letters guessed. So if I don't include C, I don't learn anything new about C position.

Whereas if I include C, I can narrow down the position.

So, for efficiency, I should include C in my second guess, and place it in a potential position. Since position 1 is out, I should put it in position 2,3,4 or 5.

Now, common positions for C: it can be first, but we know it's not, or end, like in words ending with C.

But ""c"" is common at end? Not really, many words end with C? Like picnic, but not 5-letter. 5-letter words ending with C: topic, music, ethic, etc.

In ""topic"", C is the 5th letter.

Similarly, ""logic"", ""magic"", etc.

Or C in position 2: like ""scold"", ""scale"" but A is out, so ""scale"" has A.

Avoid A.

""Scope"": S C O P E – E is out.

E is out, so avoid E.

No E, no A, no N, no R.

So, words without R, A, E, N.

Possible word with C: let's consider ""pitch"": P I T C H – C in position 4.

Letters: P I T C H

All new letters.

""witch"": W I T C H – similar.

""light"": L I G H T – no C, but must include C.

I need to include C.

""clutch"" is 6, too long.

5-letter: ""clout"": C L O U T – but C is first position, and we know C not in position 1, so if I put C in position 1, since it's not correct, it will get - or x, but it should get - because C is in word, just wrong position? Position is part of it.

If I put C in position 1 again? The feedback will tell if it's correct position or not.

In guess 1, I put C in position 1 and it was - meaning wrong position.

If I put C again in position 1, it will still be - since position is wrong.

But that doesn't gain new information; I should put C in a different position.

So better to move C to position 2,3,4 or 5.

For example, put C in position 2.

What words have C in position 2? Like ""scalp"", ""scorn"" but R and A out.

""scalp"" has A, ""scorn"" has R, both out.

""scope"" has E out.

""scout"": S C O U T

Letters: S C O U T

C in position 2.

O and U vowels, S,T consonants.

Avoid R,A,N,E.

""block"": B L O C K – C in position 4.

C in position 4.

B, L, O, K.

Oin position 3.

I could choose a word with multiple vowels since A and E are out, O and I and U are good.

Like ""music"": M U S I C – M,U,S,I,C

C in position 5.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C – C in position 5.

G might be less common.

""panic"": but A out.

""optic"": O P T I C - C in position 5, O P T I C.

Letters: O P T I C

All covered.

Now, position of C: since I put it in position 5, if it gets ✓, position 5 is correct; if -, then C is in word but not in position 5, so must be in 2,3, or 4.

If it gets -, then position 5 is wrong for C.

Similarly, if I get feedback on other letters.

But I need to decide.

Another idea: since only C is known, I can prioritize finding C's position.

For instance, put C in position 2.

Possible word: ""scald"" but A out.

""Scud"": only 4 letters. 5-letter needed.

""Scent"" but E out.

""Scowl"": S C O W L – C in position 2.

Letters: S,C,O,W,L

Avoids R,A,N,E.

Acceptable?

Or ""could"": C O U L D – C first position, which we avoid.

I should not put C in position 1.

So ""scowl"" : S C O W L – C position 2.

Similarly, ""scept"", but not common, or ""actin"" but A out.

""stick"": S T I C K – C in position 4.

S,T,I,C,K.

K is less common.

""quick"": Q U I C K – Q less common.

Better to use common letters.

I think ""music"" or ""topic"" is fine.

Since E is out, words ending with IC might be common.

""topic"": T O P I C

Letters: T O P I C

Position: T1 O2 P3 I4 C5

C in 5.

Now, for feedback, if C is correct position, I know, else not.

Also, I get info on T,O,P,I.

Similarly, if any are in word or not.

Another word: ""chill"" C first position not good.

""pical"" not common.

I'll go with ""topic"" for guess 2.

But in ""topic"", C is last, position 5.

Another option: ""slice"" but E out.

""slice"" has E? S L I C E – E, out.

So no.

""mucus"" but doesn't end with C, M U C U S – C position 3.

Letters M,U,C,U,S – U twice, less efficient? But valid word.

But ""music"" might be better: M U S I C – unique letters.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C.

""basic"" B A S I C but A out.

So avoid A.

""cynic"" C first position.

Not good.

I think ""music"" is good: M U S I C.

Position: M1 U2 S3 I4 C5

C in position 5.

I could place C in position 3 or 4 to avoid end.

For example, ""picky"" P I C K Y – C in position 3.

But Y is at end.

Or ""flesh"" no C.

Include C: "" fetch"" F E T C H – E out.

Not.

""patch"" A out.

Not.

""watch"" W A T C H – A out.

Same.

""pitch"" P I T C H – C in 4: P1 I2 T3 C4 H5

That works: letters P,I,T,C,H

All covered.

Similarly, ""witch"" W I T C H

But W might be less common.

P is common.

So ""pitch"" could be good.

Or ""ditch"" D I T C H.

But D.

No preference, P is fine.

Back to ""topic"" or ""pitch"".

In ""pitch"", C is position 4.

In ""music"", C position 5.

I'll choose ""pitch"" because it has C in position 4, and letters P,I,T,H.

But H is common, T, I, P.

Also, ""light"" no C.

I think ""pitch"" is fine.

So for second guess, I'll use ""pitch"".

But let's confirm letter exclusion: excluded R,A,N,E.

""pitch"" has P,I,T,C,H none of which are excluded.

C is included, position 4.

If in feedback, C gets ✓, position 4 is correct.

If -, then position 4 is wrong.

Similarly for others.

Now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.

First, I should think step by step, as per instructions.

Thought process:
- From first guess ""crane"", feedback: C is in word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E are not in word.
- Secret word contains C in positions 2,3,4, or 5, and excludes R,A,N,E.
- For second guess, choose a word that includes C not in position 1, and avoids R,A,N,E, while introducing new common letters to test positions.
- Selected ""pitch"" as guess: P,I,T,C,H with C in position 4 to test.
- If C is position 4, it will be ✓; if not, still in word.
- Also tests P,I,T,H which are new letters.

Now, output format should be <guess>pitch</guess>Based on the first guess ""crane"" and its feedback (C is in the word but not in position 1; R, A, N, E are not in the word), the second guess must include C in a different position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid using R, A, N, or E. The goal is to test the position of C while introducing new common letters for further information.

- C must be in the word but not position 1, so I avoid starting with C.
- I excluded R, A, N, E from possible letters.
- I chose ""pitch"" as the guess because:
  - It places C in position 4, which is one of the possible positions. This will help narrow down C's location (if feedback shows C correct, position 4 is solved; if wrong position, C is in 2, 3, or 5).
  - It introduces new common consonants (P, T, H) and a vowel (I), which are high-frequency and can provide valuable feedback.
  - The word uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N, E).",Guess 2: pitch -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(-) T(x) C(✓) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SPICY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we have no prior information.
 It's common to start with a word that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 A popular starting word in Wordle is ""crane"" or ""salet"", but I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it has distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 Let's check: C, R, A, N, E are all fairly common letters.

 Since it's the first guess, we don't have feedback. So I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 Format: We must return the guess in the specified XML tag.I'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it includes common vowels (A, E) and frequently used consonants (C, R, N). This provides a balanced mix of letters that often appear in 5-letter English words, which should help gather initial feedback about the secret word's structure. As a first guess, it maximizes the potential information gain across different positions.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I'm trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. For my first guess, I used ""crane"", and the feedback was:

- C: - meaning it's in the word but wrong position
- R: x not in the word
- A: x not in the word
- N: x not in the word
- E: x not in the word

The feedback format is:
- ✓ : correct position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

So, from the first guess:
- Only C is in the word, but not in the first position (since it got ""-""). Position: I guessed C as the first letter, but it's wrong position, so C must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5 of the secret word. But since R, A, N, E are all not in the word, that means only C is present from ""crane"", and it's not in position 1.

Letters confirmed not in word: R, A, N, E. That means the secret word contains C, but not in the first position, and excludes R, A, N, E.

Letters that are not in secret word: R, A, N, E.

Letters that are in secret word: C (but not in position 1).

Position of C: Since I guessed it in position 1 and it's wrong position, C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to use a word that includes C in a different position and avoids R, A, N, E, and introduces new letters.

I should choose a word that places C not in the first position, since it can't be position 1.

Also, avoid using R, A, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.

Since C is the only known letter to be present, I need to test other common letters.

Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5.

In my next guess, I should put C in one of these positions to see if it's correct or not. Since I don't know which position it belongs in yet, I can place it in a different position and see the feedback.

Let me think of words that start with different letters but contain C, not in position 1.

Possible words: For example, ""lucky"" – but I don't know if L, U, K, Y are in the word. Since I have limited tries, I should choose words with high-frequency letters to gather more information.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, etc., but E, A, N are already out from my first guess. E, A, N are not in the word, so I should avoid them.

R is also out.

Remaining vowels: O, U, I, etc.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, etc.

Since C is placed wrongly in position 1, it could be anywhere from 2-5.

But to maximize information, I could choose a word where C is in position 2, for instance.

Let me list possible words.

But I don't have a word list, but I know many 5-letter words.

Another idea: use a word that ends with C or has C in common positions.

For example, words with C in position 2: like ""acted"" but A is out, so no.

A is out, so avoid A.

Similarly, R, N, E are out.

So, possible words: let's start with consonant + vowel + C + consonant + vowel, but need to avoid excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E.

So, letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But C must be in the word, but not in position 1.

In the guess, I can include C in position 2,3,4, or 5.

For second guess, I should place C in position 2 to test if it might be there, or position 3, etc.

I should choose a word that doesn't start with C since C is not in position 1.

So, let's pick a word starting with, say, S or T, which are common.

And include C in position 3 or something.

Also, since E is out, avoid E.

Possible words:

- ""Music"" : M U S I C – letters: M U S I C

C is in position 5, which is one possible spot.

But U and I are vowels, S and M consonants.

- ""Climb"" : but C is first, which we can't do, since C not in position 1.

C cannot be in position 1, so first letter cannot be C.

So, words not starting with C.

""topic"": T O P I C – C at end, position 5.

Letters: T O P I C

All these letters are new except C, but C is in different position.

Then feedback would show if any are in word.

Similarly, ""basic"" but A is out, so avoid.

""optic"": O P T I C – O P T I C

C at position 5.

Another option: ""quick"": Q U I C K – C in position 4.

Q is less common.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple common letters.

Common letters not excluded: S, T, O, I, L, etc.

For example, ""still"": S T I L L – but no C, so I must include C because C is confirmed in the word.

I must include C in the guess since I know it's in the word, but I don't have to for second guess? No, I can guess without C to test other letters, but since I know C is in the word, it might be inefficient not to include it and confirm its position.

Looking at feedback: I know C is in the word but wrong position, so for second guess, if I don't include C, and I get feedback, I might think C is still wrong position or something, but the game tracks overall, but in terms of feedback for the guess.

The feedback is per guess. So if in my second guess I don't include C, but C is in the word, then for that guess, letters not C might be indicated.

But it's better to include C in a possible position to check.

For example, if I put C in position 2, and it gets ✓, then I know position 2 is C.

If it gets -, then C is not in position 2 but still in word.

If I put it and it gets x, that would contradict, but since we know C is in word, it won't get x, but feedback could be - or ✓.

Since C is in the word, any guess that includes C in a position will either get ✓ if correct position or - if wrong position, or if I don't include C, no symbol for C, but C remains confirmed present.

In the feedback for a guess, it only shows for the letters guessed. So if I don't include C, I don't learn anything new about C position.

Whereas if I include C, I can narrow down the position.

So, for efficiency, I should include C in my second guess, and place it in a potential position. Since position 1 is out, I should put it in position 2,3,4 or 5.

Now, common positions for C: it can be first, but we know it's not, or end, like in words ending with C.

But ""c"" is common at end? Not really, many words end with C? Like picnic, but not 5-letter. 5-letter words ending with C: topic, music, ethic, etc.

In ""topic"", C is the 5th letter.

Similarly, ""logic"", ""magic"", etc.

Or C in position 2: like ""scold"", ""scale"" but A is out, so ""scale"" has A.

Avoid A.

""Scope"": S C O P E – E is out.

E is out, so avoid E.

No E, no A, no N, no R.

So, words without R, A, E, N.

Possible word with C: let's consider ""pitch"": P I T C H – C in position 4.

Letters: P I T C H

All new letters.

""witch"": W I T C H – similar.

""light"": L I G H T – no C, but must include C.

I need to include C.

""clutch"" is 6, too long.

5-letter: ""clout"": C L O U T – but C is first position, and we know C not in position 1, so if I put C in position 1, since it's not correct, it will get - or x, but it should get - because C is in word, just wrong position? Position is part of it.

If I put C in position 1 again? The feedback will tell if it's correct position or not.

In guess 1, I put C in position 1 and it was - meaning wrong position.

If I put C again in position 1, it will still be - since position is wrong.

But that doesn't gain new information; I should put C in a different position.

So better to move C to position 2,3,4 or 5.

For example, put C in position 2.

What words have C in position 2? Like ""scalp"", ""scorn"" but R and A out.

""scalp"" has A, ""scorn"" has R, both out.

""scope"" has E out.

""scout"": S C O U T

Letters: S C O U T

C in position 2.

O and U vowels, S,T consonants.

Avoid R,A,N,E.

""block"": B L O C K – C in position 4.

C in position 4.

B, L, O, K.

Oin position 3.

I could choose a word with multiple vowels since A and E are out, O and I and U are good.

Like ""music"": M U S I C – M,U,S,I,C

C in position 5.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C – C in position 5.

G might be less common.

""panic"": but A out.

""optic"": O P T I C - C in position 5, O P T I C.

Letters: O P T I C

All covered.

Now, position of C: since I put it in position 5, if it gets ✓, position 5 is correct; if -, then C is in word but not in position 5, so must be in 2,3, or 4.

If it gets -, then position 5 is wrong for C.

Similarly, if I get feedback on other letters.

But I need to decide.

Another idea: since only C is known, I can prioritize finding C's position.

For instance, put C in position 2.

Possible word: ""scald"" but A out.

""Scud"": only 4 letters. 5-letter needed.

""Scent"" but E out.

""Scowl"": S C O W L – C in position 2.

Letters: S,C,O,W,L

Avoids R,A,N,E.

Acceptable?

Or ""could"": C O U L D – C first position, which we avoid.

I should not put C in position 1.

So ""scowl"" : S C O W L – C position 2.

Similarly, ""scept"", but not common, or ""actin"" but A out.

""stick"": S T I C K – C in position 4.

S,T,I,C,K.

K is less common.

""quick"": Q U I C K – Q less common.

Better to use common letters.

I think ""music"" or ""topic"" is fine.

Since E is out, words ending with IC might be common.

""topic"": T O P I C

Letters: T O P I C

Position: T1 O2 P3 I4 C5

C in 5.

Now, for feedback, if C is correct position, I know, else not.

Also, I get info on T,O,P,I.

Similarly, if any are in word or not.

Another word: ""chill"" C first position not good.

""pical"" not common.

I'll go with ""topic"" for guess 2.

But in ""topic"", C is last, position 5.

Another option: ""slice"" but E out.

""slice"" has E? S L I C E – E, out.

So no.

""mucus"" but doesn't end with C, M U C U S – C position 3.

Letters M,U,C,U,S – U twice, less efficient? But valid word.

But ""music"" might be better: M U S I C – unique letters.

Or ""logic"": L O G I C.

""basic"" B A S I C but A out.

So avoid A.

""cynic"" C first position.

Not good.

I think ""music"" is good: M U S I C.

Position: M1 U2 S3 I4 C5

C in position 5.

I could place C in position 3 or 4 to avoid end.

For example, ""picky"" P I C K Y – C in position 3.

But Y is at end.

Or ""flesh"" no C.

Include C: "" fetch"" F E T C H – E out.

Not.

""patch"" A out.

Not.

""watch"" W A T C H – A out.

Same.

""pitch"" P I T C H – C in 4: P1 I2 T3 C4 H5

That works: letters P,I,T,C,H

All covered.

Similarly, ""witch"" W I T C H

But W might be less common.

P is common.

So ""pitch"" could be good.

Or ""ditch"" D I T C H.

But D.

No preference, P is fine.

Back to ""topic"" or ""pitch"".

In ""pitch"", C is position 4.

In ""music"", C position 5.

I'll choose ""pitch"" because it has C in position 4, and letters P,I,T,H.

But H is common, T, I, P.

Also, ""light"" no C.

I think ""pitch"" is fine.

So for second guess, I'll use ""pitch"".

But let's confirm letter exclusion: excluded R,A,N,E.

""pitch"" has P,I,T,C,H none of which are excluded.

C is included, position 4.

If in feedback, C gets ✓, position 4 is correct.

If -, then position 4 is wrong.

Similarly for others.

Now, I need to output the guess in the specified format.

First, I should think step by step, as per instructions.

Thought process:
- From first guess ""crane"", feedback: C is in word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E are not in word.
- Secret word contains C in positions 2,3,4, or 5, and excludes R,A,N,E.
- For second guess, choose a word that includes C not in position 1, and avoids R,A,N,E, while introducing new common letters to test positions.
- Selected ""pitch"" as guess: P,I,T,C,H with C in position 4 to test.
- If C is position 4, it will be ✓; if not, still in word.
- Also tests P,I,T,H which are new letters.

Now, output format should be <guess>pitch</guess>Based on the first guess ""crane"" and its feedback (C is in the word but not in position 1; R, A, N, E are not in the word), the second guess must include C in a different position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid using R, A, N, or E. The goal is to test the position of C while introducing new common letters for further information.

- I excluded R, A, N, E from possible letters.
- I chose ""pitch"" as the guess because:

  - The word uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
  - It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N, E).

As a first guess, it maximizes the potential information gain across different positions.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'First, the secret word is a 5-letter English word, and I\'m trying to guess it. I have 6 tries total. For my first guess, I used ""crane"", and the feedback was:\n\n- C: - meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position\n- R: x not in the word\n- A: x not in the word\n- N: x not in the word\n- E: x not in the word\n\nThe feedback format is:\n- ✓ : correct position\n- - : letter in word but wrong position\n- x : letter not in word\n\nSo, from the first guess:\n- Only C is in the word, but not in the first position (since it got ""-""). Position: I guessed C as the first letter, but it\'s wrong position, so C must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5 of the secret word. But since R, A, N, E are all not in the word, that means only C is present from ""crane"", and it\'s not in position 1.\n\nLetters confirmed not in word: R, A, N, E. That means the secret word contains C, but not in the first position, and excludes R, A, N, E.\n\nLetters that are not in secret word: R, A, N, E.\n\nLetters that are in secret word: C (but not in position 1).\n\nPosition of C: Since I guessed it in position 1 and it\'s wrong position, C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nNow, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to use a word that includes C in a different position and avoids R, A, N, E, and introduces new letters.\n\nI should choose a word that places C not in the first position, since it can\'t be position 1.\n\nAlso, avoid using R, A, N, E, as they are confirmed absent.\n\nSince C is the only known letter to be present, I need to test other common letters.\n\nPossible positions for C: 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn my next guess, I should put C in one of these positions to see if it\'s correct or not. Since I don\'t know which position it belongs in yet, I can place it in a different position and see the feedback.\n\nLet me think of words that start with different letters but contain C, not in position 1.\n\nPossible words: For example, ""lucky"" – but I don\'t know if L, U, K, Y are in the word. Since I have limited tries, I should choose words with high-frequency letters to gather more information.\n\nCommon letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, etc., but E, A, N are already out from my first guess. E, A, N are not in the word, so I should avoid them.\n\nR is also out.\n\nRemaining vowels: O, U, I, etc.\n\nConsonants: B, D, F, G, H, etc.\n\nSince C is placed wrongly in position 1, it could be anywhere from 2-5.\n\nBut to maximize information, I could choose a word where C is in position 2, for instance.\n\nLet me list possible words.\n\nBut I don\'t have a word list, but I know many 5-letter words.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that ends with C or has C in common positions.\n\nFor example, words with C in position 2: like ""acted"" but A is out, so no.\n\nA is out, so avoid A.\n\nSimilarly, R, N, E are out.\n\nSo, possible words: let\'s start with consonant + vowel + C + consonant + vowel, but need to avoid excluded letters.\n\nExcluded letters: R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut C must be in the word, but not in position 1.\n\nIn the guess, I can include C in position 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nFor second guess, I should place C in position 2 to test if it might be there, or position 3, etc.\n\nI should choose a word that doesn\'t start with C since C is not in position 1.\n\nSo, let\'s pick a word starting with, say, S or T, which are common.\n\nAnd include C in position 3 or something.\n\nAlso, since E is out, avoid E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""Music"" : M U S I C – letters: M U S I C\n\nC is in position 5, which is one possible spot.\n\nBut U and I are vowels, S and M consonants.\n\n- ""Climb"" : but C is first, which we can\'t do, since C not in position 1.\n\nC cannot be in position 1, so first letter cannot be C.\n\nSo, words not starting with C.\n\n""topic"": T O P I C – C at end, position 5.\n\nLetters: T O P I C\n\nAll these letters are new except C, but C is in different position.\n\nThen feedback would show if any are in word.\n\nSimilarly, ""basic"" but A is out, so avoid.\n\n""optic"": O P T I C – O P T I C\n\nC at position 5.\n\nAnother option: ""quick"": Q U I C K – C in position 4.\n\nQ is less common.\n\nTo cover more ground, I could choose a word with multiple common letters.\n\nCommon letters not excluded: S, T, O, I, L, etc.\n\nFor example, ""still"": S T I L L – but no C, so I must include C because C is confirmed in the word.\n\nI must include C in the guess since I know it\'s in the word, but I don\'t have to for second guess? No, I can guess without C to test other letters, but since I know C is in the word, it might be inefficient not to include it and confirm its position.\n\nLooking at feedback: I know C is in the word but wrong position, so for second guess, if I don\'t include C, and I get feedback, I might think C is still wrong position or something, but the game tracks overall, but in terms of feedback for the guess.\n\nThe feedback is per guess. So if in my second guess I don\'t include C, but C is in the word, then for that guess, letters not C might be indicated.\n\nBut it\'s better to include C in a possible position to check.\n\nFor example, if I put C in position 2, and it gets ✓, then I know position 2 is C.\n\nIf it gets -, then C is not in position 2 but still in word.\n\nIf I put it and it gets x, that would contradict, but since we know C is in word, it won\'t get x, but feedback could be - or ✓.\n\nSince C is in the word, any guess that includes C in a position will either get ✓ if correct position or - if wrong position, or if I don\'t include C, no symbol for C, but C remains confirmed present.\n\nIn the feedback for a guess, it only shows for the letters guessed. So if I don\'t include C, I don\'t learn anything new about C position.\n\nWhereas if I include C, I can narrow down the position.\n\nSo, for efficiency, I should include C in my second guess, and place it in a potential position. Since position 1 is out, I should put it in position 2,3,4 or 5.\n\nNow, common positions for C: it can be first, but we know it\'s not, or end, like in words ending with C.\n\nBut ""c"" is common at end? Not really, many words end with C? Like picnic, but not 5-letter. 5-letter words ending with C: topic, music, ethic, etc.\n\nIn ""topic"", C is the 5th letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""logic"", ""magic"", etc.\n\nOr C in position 2: like ""scold"", ""scale"" but A is out, so ""scale"" has A.\n\nAvoid A.\n\n""Scope"": S C O P E – E is out.\n\nE is out, so avoid E.\n\nNo E, no A, no N, no R.\n\nSo, words without R, A, E, N.\n\nPossible word with C: let\'s consider ""pitch"": P I T C H – C in position 4.\n\nLetters: P I T C H\n\nAll new letters.\n\n""witch"": W I T C H – similar.\n\n""light"": L I G H T – no C, but must include C.\n\nI need to include C.\n\n""clutch"" is 6, too long.\n\n5-letter: ""clout"": C L O U T – but C is first position, and we know C not in position 1, so if I put C in position 1, since it\'s not correct, it will get - or x, but it should get - because C is in word, just wrong position? Position is part of it.\n\nIf I put C in position 1 again? The feedback will tell if it\'s correct position or not.\n\nIn guess 1, I put C in position 1 and it was - meaning wrong position.\n\nIf I put C again in position 1, it will still be - since position is wrong.\n\nBut that doesn\'t gain new information; I should put C in a different position.\n\nSo better to move C to position 2,3,4 or 5.\n\nFor example, put C in position 2.\n\nWhat words have C in position 2? Like ""scalp"", ""scorn"" but R and A out.\n\n""scalp"" has A, ""scorn"" has R, both out.\n\n""scope"" has E out.\n\n""scout"": S C O U T\n\nLetters: S C O U T\n\nC in position 2.\n\nO and U vowels, S,T consonants.\n\nAvoid R,A,N,E.\n\n""block"": B L O C K – C in position 4.\n\nC in position 4.\n\nB, L, O, K.\n\nOin position 3.\n\nI could choose a word with multiple vowels since A and E are out, O and I and U are good.\n\nLike ""music"": M U S I C – M,U,S,I,C\n\nC in position 5.\n\nOr ""logic"": L O G I C – C in position 5.\n\nG might be less common.\n\n""panic"": but A out.\n\n""optic"": O P T I C - C in position 5, O P T I C.\n\nLetters: O P T I C\n\nAll covered.\n\nNow, position of C: since I put it in position 5, if it gets ✓, position 5 is correct; if -, then C is in word but not in position 5, so must be in 2,3, or 4.\n\nIf it gets -, then position 5 is wrong for C.\n\nSimilarly, if I get feedback on other letters.\n\nBut I need to decide.\n\nAnother idea: since only C is known, I can prioritize finding C\'s position.\n\nFor instance, put C in position 2.\n\nPossible word: ""scald"" but A out.\n\n""Scud"": only 4 letters. 5-letter needed.\n\n""Scent"" but E out.\n\n""Scowl"": S C O W L – C in position 2.\n\nLetters: S,C,O,W,L\n\nAvoids R,A,N,E.\n\nAcceptable?\n\nOr ""could"": C O U L D – C first position, which we avoid.\n\nI should not put C in position 1.\n\nSo ""scowl"" : S C O W L – C position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""scept"", but not common, or ""actin"" but A out.\n\n""stick"": S T I C K – C in position 4.\n\nS,T,I,C,K.\n\nK is less common.\n\n""quick"": Q U I C K – Q less common.\n\nBetter to use common letters.\n\nI think ""music"" or ""topic"" is fine.\n\nSince E is out, words ending with IC might be common.\n\n""topic"": T O P I C\n\nLetters: T O P I C\n\nPosition: T1 O2 P3 I4 C5\n\nC in 5.\n\nNow, for feedback, if C is correct position, I know, else not.\n\nAlso, I get info on T,O,P,I.\n\nSimilarly, if any are in word or not.\n\nAnother word: ""chill"" C first position not good.\n\n""pical"" not common.\n\nI\'ll go with ""topic"" for guess 2.\n\nBut in ""topic"", C is last, position 5.\n\nAnother option: ""slice"" but E out.\n\n""slice"" has E? S L I C E – E, out.\n\nSo no.\n\n""mucus"" but doesn\'t end with C, M U C U S – C position 3.\n\nLetters M,U,C,U,S – U twice, less efficient? But valid word.\n\nBut ""music"" might be better: M U S I C – unique letters.\n\nOr ""logic"": L O G I C.\n\n""basic"" B A S I C but A out.\n\nSo avoid A.\n\n""cynic"" C first position.\n\nNot good.\n\nI think ""music"" is good: M U S I C.\n\nPosition: M1 U2 S3 I4 C5\n\nC in position 5.\n\nI could place C in position 3 or 4 to avoid end.\n\nFor example, ""picky"" P I C K Y – C in position 3.\n\nBut Y is at end.\n\nOr ""flesh"" no C.\n\nInclude C: "" fetch"" F E T C H – E out.\n\nNot.\n\n""patch"" A out.\n\nNot.\n\n""watch"" W A T C H – A out.\n\nSame.\n\n""pitch"" P I T C H – C in 4: P1 I2 T3 C4 H5\n\nThat works: letters P,I,T,C,H\n\nAll covered.\n\nSimilarly, ""witch"" W I T C H\n\nBut W might be less common.\n\nP is common.\n\nSo ""pitch"" could be good.\n\nOr ""ditch"" D I T C H.\n\nBut D.\n\nNo preference, P is fine.\n\nBack to ""topic"" or ""pitch"".\n\nIn ""pitch"", C is position 4.\n\nIn ""music"", C position 5.\n\nI\'ll choose ""pitch"" because it has C in position 4, and letters P,I,T,H.\n\nBut H is common, T, I, P.\n\nAlso, ""light"" no C.\n\nI think ""pitch"" is fine.\n\nSo for second guess, I\'ll use ""pitch"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm letter exclusion: excluded R,A,N,E.\n\n""pitch"" has P,I,T,C,H none of which are excluded.\n\nC is included, position 4.\n\nIf in feedback, C gets ✓, position 4 is correct.\n\nIf -, then position 4 is wrong.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I need to output the guess in the specified format.\n\nFirst, I should think step by step, as per instructions.\n\nThought process:\n- From first guess ""crane"", feedback: C is in word but not in position 1; R,A,N,E are not in word.\n- Secret word contains C in positions 2,3,4, or 5, and excludes R,A,N,E.\n- For second guess, choose a word that includes C not in position 1, and avoids R,A,N,E, while introducing new common letters to test positions.\n- Selected ""pitch"" as guess: P,I,T,C,H with C in position 4 to test.\n- If C is position 4, it will be ✓; if not, still in word.\n- Also tests P,I,T,H which are new letters.\n\nNow, output format should be <guess>pitch</guess>Based on the first guess ""crane"" and its feedback (C is in the word but not in position 1; R, A, N, E are not in the word), the second guess must include C in a different position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid using R, A, N, or E. The goal is to test the position of C while introducing new common letters for further information.\n\n- C must be in the word but not position 1, so I avoid starting with C.\n- I excluded R, A, N, E from possible letters.\n- I chose ""pitch"" as the guess because:\n  - It places C in position 4, which is one of the possible positions. This will help narrow down C\'s location (if feedback shows C correct, position 4 is solved; if wrong position, C is in 2, 3, or 5).\n  - It introduces new common consonants (P, T, H) and a vowel (I), which are high-frequency and can provide valuable feedback.\n  - The word uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N, E).\n\n<guess>pitch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pitch -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(-) T(x) C(✓) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (-)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter C, but not in position 1.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: ""pitch""
- P: present but wrong position (-)
- I: present but wrong position (-)
- T: not in word (x)
- C: correct position (✓) — so C is in position 4 of the secret word.
- H: not in word (x)

From this, we know:
- C is confirmed to be in position 4 (since we got ✓ for C in position 4).
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for P in position 1).
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got - for I in position 2).
- T and H are not in the word at all.

So, summarizing what we know:
- The secret word has C in position 4.
- The word contains P and I, but P is not in position 1 and I is not in position 2.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C is not in position 1, which is consistent.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We must:
- Include P and I (since they are in the word) but in different positions than tried before (P not in 1, I not in 2).
- Avoid using R, A, N, E, T, H.
- Since C is fixed in position 4, we don't need to change that.

Possible positions for P and I:
- P can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since not 1, and 4 is C).
- I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since not 2, and 4 is C).

We also need to introduce new letters to find the remaining letters of the word.

The secret word has 5 positions: _ _ _ C _

We know:
- Position 4 is C.
- The word contains P and I, but not in positions where we tried (P not 1, I not 2).

We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should choose a word that:
- Has C in position 4.
- Includes P and I in positions that are allowed (for P: 2,3,5; for I:1,3,5).
- Uses new letters for the remaining positions, avoiding excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H.

Excluded letters so far: R, A, N, E, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but I and P are in the word, so we can use them again to test positions, but we need to place them in new positions).

We should avoid repeating positions for P and I that we already know are wrong? For P, we know position 1 is wrong, so we can try position 2,3, or 5. Similarly for I, position 2 is wrong, so try 1,3, or 5.

But we can also use the same letter multiple times if needed, but in this case, we don't have duplicates.

Now, let's think of words that end with C (position 4 is C, so the word has C in the fourth position? Wait, position 4 is the fourth letter, so the word is like: ? ? ? C ?

For example, words ending with C are not common, but here C is in position 4, so the last letter is something else.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, so the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, C, letter5.

So it's not necessarily ending with C; the fifth letter is after C.

For instance, ""topic"" has C at position 4? ""topic"" is T-O-P-I-C, so positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:P, 4:I, 5:C? No, that's position 5.

I think I confused the positions.

In ""pitch"", we had P-I-T-C-H, so:
Position 1: P
Position 2: I
Position 3: T
Position 4: C
Position 5: H

And we got C(✓) for position 4, so in the secret word, position 4 is C.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ C _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

We know that:
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""pitch"" feedback: P(-) in position 1).
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""pitch"" feedback: I(-) in position 2).
- Also, from ""crane"", C is not in position 1, which is consistent.

Now, P must be in one of positions 2,3,5? Positions 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, I must be in one of positions 1,3, or 5.

But position 3 can only hold one letter, so if both P and I are to be placed, they might conflict if both want position 3.

We need to consider possibilities.

Also, there are two more letters to find for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words.

First, since position 4 is C, and we have P and I to place.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be P (since P not in 1), so position 1 must be a new letter or I? I can be in position 1.

Position 1: can be I or a new letter.

Position 2: cannot be I (since I not in 2), so position 2 must be P or a new letter? P can be in position 2.

Position 3: can be P, I, or a new letter.

Position 5: can be P, I, or a new letter.

But P and I must be placed somewhere.

Now, to maximize information, we should try to place P and I in positions we haven't tested yet.

For example, for P, we tried position 1 and it was wrong, so we can try position 2 or 3 or 5.

Similarly for I, we tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1 or 3 or 5.

We should avoid using excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But I and P are in the word, so we can use them.

Now, let's think of common words that fit.

For example, if I is in position 1, then word: I _ _ C _

With P in 2,3, or 5.

But position 2 cannot be I? Position 2 can be P, since I cannot be in 2, but P can.

If I in position 1, then position 2 can be P, for example.

Word: I P _ C _

But what can be position 3 and 5? And avoid excluded letters.

Position 3: not T, etc.

Possible word: ""impact"" but A is out, and positions: I M P A C T, but A and T out, and 6 letters? ""impact"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""spicy"" S P I C Y, but in this case, position 4 is C, so S P I C Y: position 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:Y.

But in our case, we have I and P to place, but in ""spicy"", I is in position 3, P in position 2.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We need to guess a word that fits the constraints.

Another idea: since C is fixed in position 4, we can think of words like ? ? ? C ?

Common patterns: for example, words ending with IC are common, but here position 4 is C, so it's not ending with IC; position 5 is after C.

Like ""music"" is M U S I C, so position 4 is I, not C.

We need position 4 to be C.

Examples: ""panic"" P A N I C, but A and N out.

""topic"" T O P I C, position 4 is I, not C.

""pitch"" we had, position 4 C.

Other words: ""latch"" L A T C H, A and T out.

""batch"" same.

""dutch"" D U T C H, T and H out.

""fetch"" F E T C H, E,T,H out.

Not good.

""mocha"" M O C H A, but position 4 is H? M O C H A: 1:M, 2:O, 3:C, 4:H, 5:A — but C is in position 3, not 4.

We need position 4 to be C.

So words where the fourth letter is C.

For example: ""attic"" A T T I C, but A,T out, and position 4 is I.

""Attic"" positions: 1:A, 2:T, 3:T, 4:I, 5:C.

Not.

""Artic"" similar.

""optic"" O P T I C, 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:I, 5:C.

Position 4 is I.

I'm struggling to find words with C in position 4.

Let's list some 5-letter words with C as the fourth letter.

For example:
- ""bench"" B E N C H, but E,N,H out.
- ""cinch"" C I N C H, C first, and N,H out.
- ""lynch"" L Y N C H, N,H out.
- ""pouch"" P O U C H, H out.
- ""touch"" T O U C H, T,H out.
- ""vouch"" V O U C H, H out.
- ""winch"" W I N C H, N,H out.
- ""zilch"" Z I L C H, H out.

Many have H, which is out.

""force"" F O R C E, R,E out.

""since"" S I N C E, N,E out.

""dance"" D A N C E, A,N,E out.

""mince"" M I N C E, N,E out.

""price"" P R I C E, R,E out.

""spice"" S P I C E, E out.

""spice"" has E, which is out.

But E is excluded, so no.

""voice"" V O I C E, E out.

Not.

""aback"" A B A C K, A out.

""attack"" 6 letters.

Perhaps ""comic"" C O M I C, but position 4 is I.

I think I need to think differently.

Another word: ""civic"" C I V I C, C first.

Not position 4.

""logic"" L O G I C, position 4 I.

Perhaps words like ""cleft"" but C first.

Maybe ""slick"" S L I C K, position 4 C? S L I C K: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K

Yes! Position 4 is C.

Similarly, ""click"" C L I C K, C first.

""brick"" B R I C K, R out.

""prick"" P R I C K, R out.

""stick"" S T I C K, T out.

""trick"" T R I C K, T,R out.

""quick"" Q U I C K, Q might be less common.

""flick"" F L I C K, F,L,I,C,K.

Letters: F,L,I,C,K.

Now, in this case, position 4 is C.

But in our secret word, position 4 is C, and we have to include P and I.

In ""flick"", it has I, but not P.

We need to include P because P is in the word.

Similarly, I is in the word.

So for our guess, we must include P and I, since they are in the word, and C in position 4.

C is fixed in position 4.

So the guess must have C in position 4, and include P and I in positions 1,2,3, or 5, but not in the positions that are known wrong: P not in 1, I not in 2.

Also, avoid excluded letters.

So possible positions for P: 2,3,5

For I: 1,3,5

But position 3 and 5 can be shared, but only one letter.

So we need to choose a word with C in 4, and P and I in the allowed positions.

For example:
- If P in position 2, I in position 1: word like I P _ C _
  - What can be position 3 and 5? Avoid R,A,N,E,T,H.
  - Possible: I P S C ? but S, and position 5, e.g., I P S C Y? ""ipscy"" not a word.
  - I P L C K? ""iplck"" not a word.
  - I P O C K? ""ipock"" not a word.
  - Not common.

- P in position 2, I in position 3: word like _ P I C _
  - Position 1 and 5 to fill.
  - Position 1 can be a letter, position 5 a letter.
  - Words: e.g., ""spicy"" S P I C Y, but position 4 is C? S P I C Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:Y. Yes, position 4 is C.
  - ""spicy"" has S and Y, which are not excluded.
  - Also, P is in position 2, which is allowed (since P not in 1, but position 2 is new).
  - I is in position 3, which is allowed (I not in 2, position 3 is new).
  - C in position 4, fixed.
  - Letters: S, P, I, C, Y. S and Y are new.
  - Excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H are out, S and Y are not in excluded, so ok.

- P in position 2, I in position 5: word like _ P _ C I
  - Position 1 and 3 to fill.
  - E.g., ""optic"" but position 4 is I, not C. O P T I C, position 4 I.
  - ""topic"" same.
  - ""cubic"" C U B I C, C first.
  - Not many with C in 4 and I in 5.

- P in position 3, I in position 1: word like I _ P C _
  - Position 2 and 5.
  - E.g., ""impel"" but E,L? I M P E L, position 4 E, not C.
  - Not with C in 4.

- P in position 3, I in position 2: but I cannot be in position 2, from feedback.

I not in position 2, so I cannot be in position 2.

- P in position 3, I in position 5: word like _ _ P C I
  - Position 1 and 2.
  - E.g., ""spici"" not word, ""bacon"" B A C O N, not C in 4.
  - ""loci"" not 5 letters.
  - Hard to find.

- P in position 5, I in position 1: word like I _ _ C P
  - Position 2 and 3.
  - E.g., ""incap"" I N C A P, A and N out, and position 4 A? I N C A P: 1:I,2:N,3:C,4:A,5:P — position 3 C, not 4.
  - Not.

- P in position 5, I in position 3: word like _ _ I C P
  - Position 1 and 2.
  - E.g., ""crisp"" C R I S P, C first, R out.
  - ""wisp"" W I S P, but 4 letters? ""wispy"" W I S P Y, position 4 P, not C.
  - Not.

So the most feasible seems ""spicy"": S P I C Y, with positions:
- S in 1
- P in 2
- I in 3
- C in 4
- Y in 5

Now, check against constraints:
- P is in position 2: allowed, since we know P is not in 1, but position 2 is new and possible.
- I is in position 3: allowed, since I not in 2, position 3 is new.
- C in 4: correct.
- Avoids R,A,N,E,T,H: S, P, I, C, Y — P and I are in the word, S and Y are new, not excluded.

""spicy"" is a valid English word.

We could have other options, but this seems good.

Another possibility: ""optic"" but position 4 is not C.

Or ""public"" 6 letters.

I think ""spicy"" is a good choice.

In ""spicy"", we have S in position 1, which is new, and Y in position 5.

Feedback will tell us if S and Y are in the word, and if P and I are in correct positions.

Specifically:
- If P is in position 2, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly for I in position 3.

But we don't know yet.

We might get more information.

Another word: ""civic"" not.

I think ""spicy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the feedback from guess 2.

In guess 2, ""pitch"" had P in 1 (wrong position), I in 2 (wrong position), T not, C correct, H not.

So for ""spicy"", we are putting P in 2 and I in 3.

If in secret word, P is in position 2, we get ✓ for P; if not, but P is in word, we get - for P in position 2.

Similarly for I in position 3.

Also, S and Y will be tested.

So it should be informative.

We could choose a word with P in position 3 or 5, but ""spicy"" seems straightforward.

Another word: ""picky"" P I C K Y, but position 4 is K? P I C K Y: 1:P, 2:I, 3:C, 4:K, 5:Y — position 3 is C, not 4.

Not.

""musky"" M U S K Y, no C.

Must have C in 4.

I think ""spicy"" is a good guess.

So for third guess, I'll go with ""spicy"".

But in ""spicy"", position 4 is C, yes.

Now, output.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  This indicates that C is in the secret word but not in position 1. R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

- **Guess 2: ""pitch"" → P(-) I(-) T(x) C(✓) H(x)**  
  This shows:
  - C is in the correct position (position 4).
  - P is in the word but not in position 1.
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.
  - T and H are not in the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure:** `_ _ _ C _` (C is fixed in position 4).
- **Confirmed letters in the word:** C (position 4), P, and I.
- **P's possible positions:** 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1, as per feedback).
- **I's possible positions:** 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2, as per feedback).
- **Excluded letters (not in the word):** R, A, N, E, T, H.
- **Available letters for new guesses:** B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but P and I must be included in the guess).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Must include C in position 4** to maintain the known correct position.
- **Must include P and I** to test their positions, placing them in new slots (P not in 1, I not in 2).
- **Introduce new common letters** to gather more information, avoiding excluded letters.
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters** like S, O, L, D, M, U, Y for better coverage.
- **Aim for a valid word** that fits the constraints.

The word ""spicy"" is chosen because:
- It has C in position 4 (required).
- It places P in position 2 (a new position to test, as P cannot be in 1).
- It places I in position 3 (a new position to test, as I cannot be in 2).
- It introduces S (position 1) and Y (position 5), both common letters not excluded.
- It avoids all excluded letters (R, A, N, E, T, H).
- ""Spicy"" is a valid English word, fitting the 5-letter requirement.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of P and I:
- If P is in position 2, it may be marked ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position).
- If I is in position 3, it may be marked ✓ or -.
- Feedback on S and Y will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

<guess>spicy</guess>",spicy,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: present but wrong position (-)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: not in word (x)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter C, but not in position 1.
- The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Guess 2: ""pitch""
- P: present but wrong position (-)
- I: present but wrong position (-)
- T: not in word (x)
- C: correct position (✓) — so C is in position 4 of the secret word.
- H: not in word (x)

From this, we know:
- C is confirmed to be in position 4 (since we got ✓ for C in position 4).
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for P in position 1).
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (since we got - for I in position 2).
- T and H are not in the word at all.

So, summarizing what we know:
- The secret word has C in position 4.
- The word contains P and I, but P is not in position 1 and I is not in position 2.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, T, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know that C is not in position 1, which is consistent.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We must:
- Include P and I (since they are in the word) but in different positions than tried before (P not in 1, I not in 2).
- Avoid using R, A, N, E, T, H.
- Since C is fixed in position 4, we don't need to change that.

Possible positions for P and I:
- P can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since not 1, and 4 is C).
- I can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since not 2, and 4 is C).

We also need to introduce new letters to find the remaining letters of the word.

The secret word has 5 positions: _ _ _ C _

We know:
- Position 4 is C.
- The word contains P and I, but not in positions where we tried (P not 1, I not 2).

We don't know the other two letters yet.

We should choose a word that:
- Has C in position 4.
- Includes P and I in positions that are allowed (for P: 2,3,5; for I:1,3,5).
- Uses new letters for the remaining positions, avoiding excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H.

Excluded letters so far: R, A, N, E, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but I and P are in the word, so we can use them again to test positions, but we need to place them in new positions).

We should avoid repeating positions for P and I that we already know are wrong? For P, we know position 1 is wrong, so we can try position 2,3, or 5. Similarly for I, position 2 is wrong, so try 1,3, or 5.

But we can also use the same letter multiple times if needed, but in this case, we don't have duplicates.

Now, let's think of words that end with C (position 4 is C, so the word has C in the fourth position? Wait, position 4 is the fourth letter, so the word is like: ? ? ? C ?

For example, words ending with C are not common, but here C is in position 4, so the last letter is something else.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, so the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, C, letter5.

So it's not necessarily ending with C; the fifth letter is after C.

For instance, ""topic"" has C at position 4? ""topic"" is T-O-P-I-C, so positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:P, 4:I, 5:C? No, that's position 5.

I think I confused the positions.

In ""pitch"", we had P-I-T-C-H, so:
Position 1: P
Position 2: I
Position 3: T
Position 4: C
Position 5: H

And we got C(✓) for position 4, so in the secret word, position 4 is C.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ C _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3,5.

We know that:
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (from ""pitch"" feedback: P(-) in position 1).
- I is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""pitch"" feedback: I(-) in position 2).
- Also, from ""crane"", C is not in position 1, which is consistent.

Now, P must be in one of positions 2,3,5? Positions 2,3, or 5.

Similarly, I must be in one of positions 1,3, or 5.

But position 3 can only hold one letter, so if both P and I are to be placed, they might conflict if both want position 3.

We need to consider possibilities.

Also, there are two more letters to find for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words.

First, since position 4 is C, and we have P and I to place.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be P (since P not in 1), so position 1 must be a new letter or I? I can be in position 1.

Position 1: can be I or a new letter.

Position 2: cannot be I (since I not in 2), so position 2 must be P or a new letter? P can be in position 2.

Position 3: can be P, I, or a new letter.

Position 5: can be P, I, or a new letter.

But P and I must be placed somewhere.

Now, to maximize information, we should try to place P and I in positions we haven't tested yet.

For example, for P, we tried position 1 and it was wrong, so we can try position 2 or 3 or 5.

Similarly for I, we tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1 or 3 or 5.

We should avoid using excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But I and P are in the word, so we can use them.

Now, let's think of common words that fit.

For example, if I is in position 1, then word: I _ _ C _

With P in 2,3, or 5.

But position 2 cannot be I? Position 2 can be P, since I cannot be in 2, but P can.

If I in position 1, then position 2 can be P, for example.

Word: I P _ C _

But what can be position 3 and 5? And avoid excluded letters.

Position 3: not T, etc.

Possible word: ""impact"" but A is out, and positions: I M P A C T, but A and T out, and 6 letters? ""impact"" is 6 letters.

5-letter: ""spicy"" S P I C Y, but in this case, position 4 is C, so S P I C Y: position 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:Y.

But in our case, we have I and P to place, but in ""spicy"", I is in position 3, P in position 2.

But we don't know if that's the case.

We need to guess a word that fits the constraints.

Another idea: since C is fixed in position 4, we can think of words like ? ? ? C ?

Common patterns: for example, words ending with IC are common, but here position 4 is C, so it's not ending with IC; position 5 is after C.

Like ""music"" is M U S I C, so position 4 is I, not C.

We need position 4 to be C.

Examples: ""panic"" P A N I C, but A and N out.

""topic"" T O P I C, position 4 is I, not C.

""pitch"" we had, position 4 C.

Other words: ""latch"" L A T C H, A and T out.

""batch"" same.

""dutch"" D U T C H, T and H out.

""fetch"" F E T C H, E,T,H out.

Not good.

""mocha"" M O C H A, but position 4 is H? M O C H A: 1:M, 2:O, 3:C, 4:H, 5:A — but C is in position 3, not 4.

We need position 4 to be C.

So words where the fourth letter is C.

For example: ""attic"" A T T I C, but A,T out, and position 4 is I.

""Attic"" positions: 1:A, 2:T, 3:T, 4:I, 5:C.

Not.

""Artic"" similar.

""optic"" O P T I C, 1:O, 2:P, 3:T, 4:I, 5:C.

Position 4 is I.

I'm struggling to find words with C in position 4.

Let's list some 5-letter words with C as the fourth letter.

For example:
- ""bench"" B E N C H, but E,N,H out.
- ""cinch"" C I N C H, C first, and N,H out.
- ""lynch"" L Y N C H, N,H out.
- ""pouch"" P O U C H, H out.
- ""touch"" T O U C H, T,H out.
- ""vouch"" V O U C H, H out.
- ""winch"" W I N C H, N,H out.
- ""zilch"" Z I L C H, H out.

Many have H, which is out.

""force"" F O R C E, R,E out.

""since"" S I N C E, N,E out.

""dance"" D A N C E, A,N,E out.

""mince"" M I N C E, N,E out.

""price"" P R I C E, R,E out.

""spice"" S P I C E, E out.

""spice"" has E, which is out.

But E is excluded, so no.

""voice"" V O I C E, E out.

Not.

""aback"" A B A C K, A out.

""attack"" 6 letters.

Perhaps ""comic"" C O M I C, but position 4 is I.

I think I need to think differently.

Another word: ""civic"" C I V I C, C first.

Not position 4.

""logic"" L O G I C, position 4 I.

Perhaps words like ""cleft"" but C first.

Maybe ""slick"" S L I C K, position 4 C? S L I C K: 1:S, 2:L, 3:I, 4:C, 5:K

Yes! Position 4 is C.

Similarly, ""click"" C L I C K, C first.

""brick"" B R I C K, R out.

""prick"" P R I C K, R out.

""stick"" S T I C K, T out.

""trick"" T R I C K, T,R out.

""quick"" Q U I C K, Q might be less common.

""flick"" F L I C K, F,L,I,C,K.

Letters: F,L,I,C,K.

Now, in this case, position 4 is C.

But in our secret word, position 4 is C, and we have to include P and I.

In ""flick"", it has I, but not P.

We need to include P because P is in the word.

Similarly, I is in the word.

So for our guess, we must include P and I, since they are in the word, and C in position 4.

C is fixed in position 4.

So the guess must have C in position 4, and include P and I in positions 1,2,3, or 5, but not in the positions that are known wrong: P not in 1, I not in 2.

Also, avoid excluded letters.

So possible positions for P: 2,3,5

For I: 1,3,5

But position 3 and 5 can be shared, but only one letter.

So we need to choose a word with C in 4, and P and I in the allowed positions.

For example:
- If P in position 2, I in position 1: word like I P _ C _
  - What can be position 3 and 5? Avoid R,A,N,E,T,H.
  - Possible: I P S C ? but S, and position 5, e.g., I P S C Y? ""ipscy"" not a word.
  - I P L C K? ""iplck"" not a word.
  - I P O C K? ""ipock"" not a word.
  - Not common.

- P in position 2, I in position 3: word like _ P I C _
  - Position 1 and 5 to fill.
  - Position 1 can be a letter, position 5 a letter.
  - Words: e.g., ""spicy"" S P I C Y, but position 4 is C? S P I C Y: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:Y. Yes, position 4 is C.
  - ""spicy"" has S and Y, which are not excluded.
  - Also, P is in position 2, which is allowed (since P not in 1, but position 2 is new).
  - I is in position 3, which is allowed (I not in 2, position 3 is new).
  - C in position 4, fixed.
  - Letters: S, P, I, C, Y. S and Y are new.
  - Excluded letters: R,A,N,E,T,H are out, S and Y are not in excluded, so ok.

- P in position 2, I in position 5: word like _ P _ C I
  - Position 1 and 3 to fill.
  - E.g., ""optic"" but position 4 is I, not C. O P T I C, position 4 I.
  - ""topic"" same.
  - ""cubic"" C U B I C, C first.
  - Not many with C in 4 and I in 5.

- P in position 3, I in position 1: word like I _ P C _
  - Position 2 and 5.
  - E.g., ""impel"" but E,L? I M P E L, position 4 E, not C.
  - Not with C in 4.

- P in position 3, I in position 2: but I cannot be in position 2, from feedback.

I not in position 2, so I cannot be in position 2.

- P in position 3, I in position 5: word like _ _ P C I
  - Position 1 and 2.
  - E.g., ""spici"" not word, ""bacon"" B A C O N, not C in 4.
  - ""loci"" not 5 letters.
  - Hard to find.

- P in position 5, I in position 1: word like I _ _ C P
  - Position 2 and 3.
  - E.g., ""incap"" I N C A P, A and N out, and position 4 A? I N C A P: 1:I,2:N,3:C,4:A,5:P — position 3 C, not 4.
  - Not.

- P in position 5, I in position 3: word like _ _ I C P
  - Position 1 and 2.
  - E.g., ""crisp"" C R I S P, C first, R out.
  - ""wisp"" W I S P, but 4 letters? ""wispy"" W I S P Y, position 4 P, not C.
  - Not.

So the most feasible seems ""spicy"": S P I C Y, with positions:
- S in 1
- P in 2
- I in 3
- C in 4
- Y in 5

Now, check against constraints:
- P is in position 2: allowed, since we know P is not in 1, but position 2 is new and possible.
- I is in position 3: allowed, since I not in 2, position 3 is new.
- C in 4: correct.
- Avoids R,A,N,E,T,H: S, P, I, C, Y — P and I are in the word, S and Y are new, not excluded.

""spicy"" is a valid English word.

We could have other options, but this seems good.

Another possibility: ""optic"" but position 4 is not C.

Or ""public"" 6 letters.

I think ""spicy"" is a good choice.

In ""spicy"", we have S in position 1, which is new, and Y in position 5.

Feedback will tell us if S and Y are in the word, and if P and I are in correct positions.

Specifically:
- If P is in position 2, it might be correct or not.
- Similarly for I in position 3.

But we don't know yet.

We might get more information.

Another word: ""civic"" not.

I think ""spicy"" is fine.

But let's confirm the feedback from guess 2.

In guess 2, ""pitch"" had P in 1 (wrong position), I in 2 (wrong position), T not, C correct, H not.

So for ""spicy"", we are putting P in 2 and I in 3.

If in secret word, P is in position 2, we get ✓ for P; if not, but P is in word, we get - for P in position 2.

Similarly for I in position 3.

Also, S and Y will be tested.

So it should be informative.

We could choose a word with P in position 3 or 5, but ""spicy"" seems straightforward.

Another word: ""picky"" P I C K Y, but position 4 is K? P I C K Y: 1:P, 2:I, 3:C, 4:K, 5:Y — position 3 is C, not 4.

Not.

""musky"" M U S K Y, no C.

Must have C in 4.

I think ""spicy"" is a good guess.

So for third guess, I'll go with ""spicy"".

But in ""spicy"", position 4 is C, yes.

Now, output.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  This indicates that C is in the secret word but not in position 1. R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all.

- **Guess 2: ""pitch"" → P(-) I(-) T(x) C(✓) H(x)**  
  This shows:
  - C is in the correct position (position 4).
  - P is in the word but not in position 1.
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.
  - T and H are not in the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word structure:** `_ _ _ C _` (C is fixed in position 4).

- **Available letters for new guesses:** B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but P and I must be included in the guess).

### Strategy for Guess 3:

The word ""spicy"" is chosen because:

- It avoids all excluded letters (R, A, N, E, T, H).
- ""Spicy"" is a valid English word, fitting the 5-letter requirement.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of P and I:

- If I is in position 3, it may be marked ✓ or -.
- Feedback on S and Y will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.",Guess 3: spicy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) C(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
