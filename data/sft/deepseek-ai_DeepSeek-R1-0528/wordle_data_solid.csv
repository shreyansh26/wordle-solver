We are given feedback that for the guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, or E.

 Since none of these letters are in the secret word, we must avoid using them in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.

 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we should avoid the ones we know are not present.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 Some common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, I, O, U, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word that includes some of the most common remaining letters.

 For example, words like ""SPLIT"", ""GHOUL"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 Let me try to think of a word that uses common letters and avoids the forbidden ones (C, R, A, N, E).

 One common word is ""SPLIT"": 
   S, P, L, I, T

 But note: we don't know if these letters are in the word, but we are trying to test new ones.

 Alternatively, we could use ""MOUTH"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's consider the frequency.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""BUILD"" but that has 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters. ""BUILD"" is 5 letters? 
 Actually, ""BUILD"" is 5 letters: B-U-I-L-D.

 However, we might also consider ""GHOUL"" (which is 5 letters: G-H-O-U-L) but it's less common.

 Let's list some words without C,R,A,N,E:

 - split: S, P, L, I, T
 - built: B, U, I, L, T
 - ghost: G, H, O, S, T
 - pilot: P, I, L, O, T -> but note we have to avoid A and E, and this doesn't have them.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to reuse letters we already know are absent? 
 But in this case, we know C,R,A,N,E are absent, so we can use any other letters.

 I think ""SPLIT"" is a good candidate because it has common letters: S, P, L, I, T.

 Alternatively, we could use a word with more vowels? We have I and O and U left. 
 But we have only one vowel in ""SPLIT"" (I). 

 Another option: ""POULT"" (which is a young chicken) but that's obscure.

 Let's go with a more common word: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This has two vowels (O and I) and common consonants.

 But note: we are avoiding A and E, and we haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 However, we must make sure the word is valid. ""MOIST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is also valid: P, I, O, U, S. This has three vowels (I, O, U) and two consonants (P, S).

 Since we have no information, testing more vowels might be good. But we also want to cover consonants.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has a mix and is common.

 But let me check: we are going to avoid the letters we already know are absent (C,R,A,N,E). 
 ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I'll go with ""moist"".

 However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" was all x, so we are free to use any other letters.

 Another candidate: ""SLUMP"" or ""DUMPY"", but I think ""MOIST"" is better.

 Let me think of the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without the letters we know are absent.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are:
 T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So, ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) is also a good candidate.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is fine.

 Alternatively, we can use ""GHOUL"" to test some less common letters? But that might not be efficient.

 I think we should stick to common letters.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"".

 But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries (including this one). 

 So, I'll guess ""moist"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters to maximize information. 

I considered words like ""split"" (S, P, L, I, T) and ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T), but ultimately chose ""moist"" because:
- It uses high-frequency letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested)
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants
- ""MOIST"" is a common English word, ensuring validity

This guess will help identify new correct letters/positions efficiently.

But we also want to cover consonants.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has a mix and is common.\n\n But let me check: we are going to avoid the letters we already know are absent (C,R,A,N,E). \n ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""moist"".\n\n However, note that the feedback for ""crane"" was all x, so we are free to use any other letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLUMP"" or ""DUMPY"", but I think ""MOIST"" is better.\n\n Let me think of the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without the letters we know are absent.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are:\n T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n So, ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) is also a good candidate.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is fine.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""GHOUL"" to test some less common letters? But that might not be efficient.\n\n I think we should stick to common letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""MOIST"".\n\n But note: we are on the second guess, and we have 5 more tries (including this one). \n\n So, I\'ll guess ""moist"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters to maximize information. \n\nI considered words like ""split"" (S, P, L, I, T) and ""built"" (B, U, I, L, T), but ultimately chose ""moist"" because:\n- It uses high-frequency letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested)\n- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants\n- ""MOIST"" is a common English word, ensuring validity\n\nThis guess will help identify new correct letters/positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(-) S(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word contains none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: moist → M(x), O(✓), I(-), S(-), T(x)
- O is correct and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- I is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word, but not the third position).
- S is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word, but not the fourth position).
- M and T are absent (so the secret word also doesn't have M or T).

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as O: _ O _ _ _
- It contains the letters I and S, but not in the positions we guessed (so I cannot be in position 3 and S cannot be in position 4).
- Additionally, the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Since I is present but not in position 3, and S is present but not in position 4, they must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3 (for S? but wait positions: we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 left for I and S? However, note that position 2 is fixed as O).

The word has 5 positions:
Position 1: unknown, cannot be O (since O is fixed at 2), and must not be any forbidden letter.
Position 2: O (fixed).
Position 3: unknown, but cannot be I (since the feedback says I is in wrong position and it was guessed in position 3).
Position 4: unknown, but cannot be S (since S was guessed in position 4 and feedback says wrong position).
Position 5: unknown.

Also, we know the word contains both I and S, but we don't know in which positions.

Moreover, we must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

So available letters: We can use any letter except: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Remaining vowels: U, O (O is already used, but we can have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates. However, in this case, we have no indication of duplicates yet. But we should not assume without reason.)

We need to find a word that matches:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains I and S (but not in position 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, I could be in position 1, 4, or 5; and S in position 1, 3, or 5).

Let's think of possible words.

We know the word has at least three letters: O (at 2), I, and S.

We need to assign I and S to positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but with constraints:
- I cannot be at position 3? Wait, in guess 2, I was at position 3 and got (-) meaning it's in the word but not there. So I must be in one of {1, 4, 5}.
- S cannot be at position 4? Because in guess 2, S was at position 4 and got (-), so S must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.

Note: Position 3: available for S? Yes. Position 4: available for I? Yes.

Also, we must account for the other two positions: one of them might have I or S, and the remaining positions must be filled with new letters we haven't tested? Or possibly duplicates? But let's try without duplicates first.

We need to include I and S, and also two more letters (since the word has 5 letters and we already have O, I, S).

But note: O is one letter, I and S are two more, so two additional letters are needed.

We must choose two additional letters from the forbidden list? No, avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels: O (already used), U, and possibly Y.

We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Let's list possible words that fit:

Structure: _ O _ _ _

With I in {1,4,5} and S in {1,3,5}, and the word must contain both I and S.

Possible cases:

Case 1: I at position 1, then S could be at 3 or 5 (but not at 1 because then we have two uses of the same position? No, position 1 can only have one letter). So:
- If I is at 1: then word is I O _ _ _
  Then S can be at 3 or 5 (not at 4 because S was not allowed at 4? Actually, S could be at 4? Wait, the feedback for S in guess 2 was at position 4 and got (-), meaning S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Yes, because the feedback explicitly says it's not in that position.

Therefore, S must be in 1, 3, or 5 — but if I is at 1, then position 1 is taken, so S can only be at 3 or 5.

Similarly, if we put S at position 1, then I must be at 4 or 5.

But wait, I cannot be at position 3? Correct, because we already know I is not at 3.

So let's enumerate:

Option A: Position 1: I, then S must be at 3 or 5 -> 
  Word: I O [if S at 3: S] or [something else] at 3, or if S at 5: then word is I O _ _ S

But we need to fill the other blanks.

Option B: Position 1: S, then I must be at 4 or 5 (since not at 3) -> 
  Word: S O [at 3: not S and not I? Then what?] and then I at 4 or 5.

Option C: Position 1 is neither I nor S? Then both I and S must appear in positions 3,4,5? But positions 3 and 4 are not possible for I and S individually? 
Specifically: I must be in {1,4,5} and S must be in {1,3,5}. 
So if position 1 is not I or S, then:
- I must be in {4,5}
- S must be in {3,5}
But note position 5 could have both? Only if I and S are the same letter? But they are different letters, so position 5 can have only one. Therefore, we must have:
  Either:
    I at 4 and S at 3 (and then position 5 is a new letter)
    Or I at 4 and S at 5 -> but then position 3 must be something else? But then S would be at 5 -> acceptable.
    Or I at 5 and S at 3 -> acceptable.
    Or I at 5 and S at 5 -> impossible.

So possible if position 1 is not I or S:
- (I at 4, S at 3): word: _ O S I _
- (I at 4, S at 5): word: _ O _ I S
- (I at 5, S at 3): word: _ O S _ I

Now, we also haven to fill the blank positions and avoid forbidden letters.

Moreover, we must form valid English words.

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

We also want to cover more letters to gather information.

Given we have 6 guesses total, we are on the third guess.

Let me think of potential words:

First, from the above:

Pattern 1: I O _ _ _ with S in position 3 or 5? Not necessarily, because in this pattern I is at 1, but then the word is I O ... 

We must avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

Consider words:

Pattern: I O ? ? ? 

If S is at 3: then ""I O S ? ?"" -> words like ""IOS??"" ... possible: ""IOSIS"" (not common), ""IOTAS"" (but A is forbidden). What about ""IOSUL"" (not a word). Not great.

If S is at 5: ""I O ? ? S"" -> words like ""I O _ _ S"". What might be: ""IOKUS""? No. ""IODUS""? No. Not easy.

Alternatively, pattern: S O _ _ _ 
Then I at 4 or 5: 
- If I at 4: ""S O _ I _"" 
- If I at 5: ""S O _ _ I""

Words like: SOFIS? Not a word. SOLID? But L and D are allowed? SOLID: S O L I D -> let's check letters: S, O, L, I, D.
Are these allowed? L and D are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

SOLID: 
- S: present? Yes, in the secret word? We know S is present, but in our pattern we have S at position 1. And we need I at 4 -> SOLID has I at position 4? Positions: 
  Position1: S, Position2: O, Position3: L, Position4: I, Position5: D.

But the feedback says S is not in position 4? Here S is at position 1, which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not at position 4.

Also, I is at position 4. But the feedback said I must not be at position 3? Here I is at 4, so that's fine.

Check against feedback: 
In guess 2 (moist): O was at position 2 and is correct (so secret has O at 2). 
SOLID has O at 2? Yes.

Also, SOLID has I and S: S at 1, I at 4 -> both present? Yes.

Moreover, L and D are new letters.

Does it use forbidden letters? No: L and D are not in {C,R,A,N,E,M,T}.

But wait, we haven't tested L and D, so they might be in the word.

However, is SOLID a valid guess? Yes.

But let me see if it matches the feedback:

We have: O(✓) at position 2.

I(-) in guess2 (position3) -> now I is at position4? So in the secret word, if it's SOLID, then when we guessed MOIST (with I at position3), the secret has I at position4 -> so the feedback should have reported (-) for I, which we got.

S(-) in guess2 (at position4): secret has S at position1 -> not at position4, so (-) is correct.

So SOLID is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Pattern without I or S at position1?

For example: _ O S I _ -> something O S I ? 

Words: POSIT? But P is allowed? POSIT: P O S I T -> but T is forbidden? Yes, T is forbidden (in guess2 T got x). So cannot use T.

Also, FOSIL? Not common.

Or _ O _ I S -> examples: DOGIS? Not a word. FOCIS? No. LOGIS? Word? Not really. More common: TOUIS? Not a word.

Perhaps: BOGUS? But S is at position5? And we have structure: ? O ? I S? Wait, we have I in position4? So let me see: BOGUS -> positions: B O G U S -> I is not at position4? So misses I. Not acceptable because we must have I.

We know the word must contain I, so if we don't have I in that pattern, it's wrong.

Pattern _ O S _ I: examples: JOSTI? Not a word. DOSHI? Perhaps? But what?

Maybe we choose SOLID. But let's see if we can test more letters.

We already know O, I, S must be in the word. For the third guess, we want to maximize information by introducing new letters? But SOLID uses L and D which are new.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that follows the constraints and tests letters we haven't tried.

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and some of these are common.

In SOLID: uses L and D -> both common.

Another word: POSH? Only 4 letters. Not 5.

What about: OUSEL? But O is at position1? We have O fixed at position2.

Must be _ O _ _ _

Another word: BOILS? But I and S are present? B O I L S -> second letter O: good.

Positions: 
Position1: B
Position2: O
Position3: I -> but the feedback said I is not in position3? And in BOILS, I is at position3 -> that would be invalid? No, wait: if the secret word has I at position3, then when we guessed MOIST (I in position3), it should have been marked as ✓? But we got (-) meaning it's in the word but not position3. Therefore, the secret word cannot have I at position3. So BOILS is impossible.

Similarly, we cannot have any word with I in position3.

Another word: DOILY? Not 5 letters? DOILY is 5 letters: D O I L Y -> I at position3 -> again invalid? Exactly.

So we avoid I at position3.

What about SOLID: I is at position4 -> acceptable.

Another: SOULI? That would be S O U L I -> I at position5? And S at position1? Then it has S, O, U, L, I.

Does it include I? Yes. And O at position2? Yes.

Check feedback constraints: 
I: in SOULI, I is at position5 -> so it's not at position3? Good.
S: at position1 -> not at position4? Good.

And forbidden letters? U, L, I, S, O -> U and L are new and allowed.

Is SOULI a word? It might be obscure. SOULI is not common. Better SOLID.

What about: SOLID, SOLDI, SOLID is the common word.

Another possibility: if we don't have position1 as S, but as something else? Pattern: _ O S I _ -> but we need a word with positions fixed: ? O S I ?

We have: letters: unknown1, O, S, I, unknown5.

Words: POSIT is invalid because T is forbidden. Other words: FOSIS? Not valid. ROSIN? But R is forbidden? And N is forbidden? Forget.

Similarly, D OSIS? Not a word.

Or HOWIS? Not valid.

So probably SOLID is a good choice.

But we also have another pattern: _ O _ I S -> then word must be ? O ? I S? Examples: DOVIS? Not word. LOGIS? LOGIS is not common. Other: BOXIS? Not valid.

Or: FOWIS? No.

So SOLID seems a good candidate.

But we must consider: the feedback does not rule out duplicates? What if the word has two O's? But we guessed O and got ✓, so only one O? Not necessarily, but we have no information.

In SOLID, there's one O.

Now, let me check: guess SOLID.

If the secret word is SOLID, then:
- O at position2: ✓
- I at position4: so not at position3 -> matches our feedback
- S at position1: so not at position4 -> matches
- L and D: we haven't tested yet.

But even if SOLID is correct, it might not be, so we want to test letters.

Another candidate: GOUIS? Not a word.

Or PIOUS? But in PIOUS: P I O U S -> no, structure: second letter O? But P I O U S: position2 is I? Not O.

We need second letter O.

Another candidate: SHOWN? But has W and N -> N forbidden? Forget.

Perhaps: SOLVE? But V is new? SOLVE: S O L V E -> but E is forbidden? And E is forbidden? Yes, E is forbidden because it was in ""crane"" and got x. So SOLVE must not use E.

Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

Therefore, SOLID: D is allowed? Yes.

Another possibility: SOUPY? But has Y? And no I? Doesn't have I? We must have I in the word? So cannot.

Thus, SOLID is a good guess.

Another word: DOZIL? Not a common word.

Or FOXIL? Not valid.

I think SOLID is the best so far.

We can try: SOLID.

But note: after three guesses, we'll get more information.

Other words similar: SKOLL? But no I? Must have I.

Only SOLID comes to mind.

What about: BLOWY? But no I and S? Impossible.

LOUIE? But E forbidden? And structure: L O U I E -> E forbidden? And position2 is O? But LOUIE: L O U I E -> E forbidden? So ""LOUIE"" has E? And E is forbidden? So no.

Perhaps: IOPUS? Not word.

So I'll go with SOLID.

Therefore, guess: solid

But note: in SOLID, we have S at position1, which we know is correct? Not necessarily, because the feedback said S is in the word but not at position4. So position1 is possible.

But we don't know if S is actually at position1 or not? We are guessing it might be.

We can also consider a word that puts S in position3 or position5 to test.

For example, we can try a word that places S in position3? But in the pattern we have possibility: _ O S _ I -> but what words exist? For example, POSIT (invalid due to T), MOSSI? Not word.

Perhaps: DOSSY -> but not common and D O S S Y -> but no I? Must have I? DOSSY doesn't have I.

So if we put S at position3, and I at position5: _ O S _ I -> for example, FOSSI? Not valid. How about ""JOSSY""? and I? Not.

So let's stick with SOLID.

We might also try: HIOIS? Not valid.

Therefore, I'll guess ""solid"".

<guess>solid</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": Letters C, R, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From ""moist"":
  - O is correct and in position 2 (second letter).
  - I is present but not in position 3.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M and T are **not** in the secret word.

This means:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
- It contains both I and S, but I cannot be in position 3 and S cannot be in position 4.
- The remaining letters must avoid forbidden characters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Considering possible words that fit these constraints, ""solid"" (S at position 1, O at position 2, L at position 3, I at position 4, D at position 5) meets the criteria:
- O is in position 2 as required.
- I is present (position 4), avoiding position 3.
- S is present (position 1), avoiding position 4.
- Uses new letters L and D for further testing.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

This guess should provide valuable feedback on letter positions while testing new characters.

<guess>solid</guess>",solid,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So the secret word contains none of these letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Guess 2: moist → M(x), O(✓), I(-), S(-), T(x)
- O is correct and in the correct position (second letter). So the secret word has O as the second letter.
- I is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word, but not the third position).
- S is present but in the wrong position (so it's in the word, but not the fourth position).
- M and T are absent (so the secret word also doesn't have M or T).

From the feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the second letter as O: _ O _ _ _
- It contains the letters I and S, but not in the positions we guessed (so I cannot be in position 3 and S cannot be in position 4).
- Additionally, the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Since I is present but not in position 3, and S is present but not in position 4, they must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3 (for S? but wait positions: we have positions 1, 3, 4, 5 left for I and S? However, note that position 2 is fixed as O).

The word has 5 positions:
Position 1: unknown, cannot be O (since O is fixed at 2), and must not be any forbidden letter.
Position 2: O (fixed).
Position 3: unknown, but cannot be I (since the feedback says I is in wrong position and it was guessed in position 3).
Position 4: unknown, but cannot be S (since S was guessed in position 4 and feedback says wrong position).
Position 5: unknown.

Also, we know the word contains both I and S, but we don't know in which positions.

Moreover, we must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

So available letters: We can use any letter except: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Remaining vowels: U, O (O is already used, but we can have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't rule out duplicates. However, in this case, we have no indication of duplicates yet. But we should not assume without reason.)

We need to find a word that matches:
- Second letter is O.
- Contains I and S (but not in position 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, I could be in position 1, 4, or 5; and S in position 1, 3, or 5).

Let's think of possible words.

We know the word has at least three letters: O (at 2), I, and S.

We need to assign I and S to positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but with constraints:
- I cannot be at position 3? Wait, in guess 2, I was at position 3 and got (-) meaning it's in the word but not there. So I must be in one of {1, 4, 5}.
- S cannot be at position 4? Because in guess 2, S was at position 4 and got (-), so S must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.

Note: Position 3: available for S? Yes. Position 4: available for I? Yes.

Also, we must account for the other two positions: one of them might have I or S, and the remaining positions must be filled with new letters we haven't tested? Or possibly duplicates? But let's try without duplicates first.

We need to include I and S, and also two more letters (since the word has 5 letters and we already have O, I, S).

But note: O is one letter, I and S are two more, so two additional letters are needed.

We must choose two additional letters from the forbidden list? No, avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels: O (already used), U, and possibly Y.

We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Let's list possible words that fit:

Structure: _ O _ _ _

With I in {1,4,5} and S in {1,3,5}, and the word must contain both I and S.

Possible cases:

Case 1: I at position 1, then S could be at 3 or 5 (but not at 1 because then we have two uses of the same position? No, position 1 can only have one letter). So:
- If I is at 1: then word is I O _ _ _
  Then S can be at 3 or 5 (not at 4 because S was not allowed at 4? Actually, S could be at 4? Wait, the feedback for S in guess 2 was at position 4 and got (-), meaning S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4 in the secret word? Yes, because the feedback explicitly says it's not in that position.

Therefore, S must be in 1, 3, or 5 — but if I is at 1, then position 1 is taken, so S can only be at 3 or 5.

Similarly, if we put S at position 1, then I must be at 4 or 5.

But wait, I cannot be at position 3? Correct, because we already know I is not at 3.

So let's enumerate:

Option A: Position 1: I, then S must be at 3 or 5 -> 
  Word: I O [if S at 3: S] or [something else] at 3, or if S at 5: then word is I O _ _ S

But we need to fill the other blanks.

Option B: Position 1: S, then I must be at 4 or 5 (since not at 3) -> 
  Word: S O [at 3: not S and not I? Then what?] and then I at 4 or 5.

Option C: Position 1 is neither I nor S? Then both I and S must appear in positions 3,4,5? But positions 3 and 4 are not possible for I and S individually? 
Specifically: I must be in {1,4,5} and S must be in {1,3,5}. 
So if position 1 is not I or S, then:
- I must be in {4,5}
- S must be in {3,5}
But note position 5 could have both? Only if I and S are the same letter? But they are different letters, so position 5 can have only one. Therefore, we must have:
  Either:
    I at 4 and S at 3 (and then position 5 is a new letter)
    Or I at 4 and S at 5 -> but then position 3 must be something else? But then S would be at 5 -> acceptable.
    Or I at 5 and S at 3 -> acceptable.
    Or I at 5 and S at 5 -> impossible.

So possible if position 1 is not I or S:
- (I at 4, S at 3): word: _ O S I _
- (I at 4, S at 5): word: _ O _ I S
- (I at 5, S at 3): word: _ O S _ I

Now, we also haven to fill the blank positions and avoid forbidden letters.

Moreover, we must form valid English words.

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

We also want to cover more letters to gather information.

Given we have 6 guesses total, we are on the third guess.

Let me think of potential words:

First, from the above:

Pattern 1: I O _ _ _ with S in position 3 or 5? Not necessarily, because in this pattern I is at 1, but then the word is I O ... 

We must avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

Consider words:

Pattern: I O ? ? ? 

If S is at 3: then ""I O S ? ?"" -> words like ""IOS??"" ... possible: ""IOSIS"" (not common), ""IOTAS"" (but A is forbidden). What about ""IOSUL"" (not a word). Not great.

If S is at 5: ""I O ? ? S"" -> words like ""I O _ _ S"". What might be: ""IOKUS""? No. ""IODUS""? No. Not easy.

Alternatively, pattern: S O _ _ _ 
Then I at 4 or 5: 
- If I at 4: ""S O _ I _"" 
- If I at 5: ""S O _ _ I""

Words like: SOFIS? Not a word. SOLID? But L and D are allowed? SOLID: S O L I D -> let's check letters: S, O, L, I, D.
Are these allowed? L and D are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

SOLID: 
- S: present? Yes, in the secret word? We know S is present, but in our pattern we have S at position 1. And we need I at 4 -> SOLID has I at position 4? Positions: 
  Position1: S, Position2: O, Position3: L, Position4: I, Position5: D.

But the feedback says S is not in position 4? Here S is at position 1, which is allowed because the feedback only said S is not at position 4.

Also, I is at position 4. But the feedback said I must not be at position 3? Here I is at 4, so that's fine.

Check against feedback: 
In guess 2 (moist): O was at position 2 and is correct (so secret has O at 2). 
SOLID has O at 2? Yes.

Also, SOLID has I and S: S at 1, I at 4 -> both present? Yes.

Moreover, L and D are new letters.

Does it use forbidden letters? No: L and D are not in {C,R,A,N,E,M,T}.

But wait, we haven't tested L and D, so they might be in the word.

However, is SOLID a valid guess? Yes.

But let me see if it matches the feedback:

We have: O(✓) at position 2.

I(-) in guess2 (position3) -> now I is at position4? So in the secret word, if it's SOLID, then when we guessed MOIST (with I at position3), the secret has I at position4 -> so the feedback should have reported (-) for I, which we got.

S(-) in guess2 (at position4): secret has S at position1 -> not at position4, so (-) is correct.

So SOLID is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other possibilities.

Pattern without I or S at position1?

For example: _ O S I _ -> something O S I ? 

Words: POSIT? But P is allowed? POSIT: P O S I T -> but T is forbidden? Yes, T is forbidden (in guess2 T got x). So cannot use T.

Also, FOSIL? Not common.

Or _ O _ I S -> examples: DOGIS? Not a word. FOCIS? No. LOGIS? Word? Not really. More common: TOUIS? Not a word.

Perhaps: BOGUS? But S is at position5? And we have structure: ? O ? I S? Wait, we have I in position4? So let me see: BOGUS -> positions: B O G U S -> I is not at position4? So misses I. Not acceptable because we must have I.

We know the word must contain I, so if we don't have I in that pattern, it's wrong.

Pattern _ O S _ I: examples: JOSTI? Not a word. DOSHI? Perhaps? But what?

Maybe we choose SOLID. But let's see if we can test more letters.

We already know O, I, S must be in the word. For the third guess, we want to maximize information by introducing new letters? But SOLID uses L and D which are new.

Alternatively, we can think of a word that follows the constraints and tests letters we haven't tried.

We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and some of these are common.

In SOLID: uses L and D -> both common.

Another word: POSH? Only 4 letters. Not 5.

What about: OUSEL? But O is at position1? We have O fixed at position2.

Must be _ O _ _ _

Another word: BOILS? But I and S are present? B O I L S -> second letter O: good.

Positions: 
Position1: B
Position2: O
Position3: I -> but the feedback said I is not in position3? And in BOILS, I is at position3 -> that would be invalid? No, wait: if the secret word has I at position3, then when we guessed MOIST (I in position3), it should have been marked as ✓? But we got (-) meaning it's in the word but not position3. Therefore, the secret word cannot have I at position3. So BOILS is impossible.

Similarly, we cannot have any word with I in position3.

Another word: DOILY? Not 5 letters? DOILY is 5 letters: D O I L Y -> I at position3 -> again invalid? Exactly.

So we avoid I at position3.

What about SOLID: I is at position4 -> acceptable.

Another: SOULI? That would be S O U L I -> I at position5? And S at position1? Then it has S, O, U, L, I.

Does it include I? Yes. And O at position2? Yes.

Check feedback constraints: 
I: in SOULI, I is at position5 -> so it's not at position3? Good.
S: at position1 -> not at position4? Good.

And forbidden letters? U, L, I, S, O -> U and L are new and allowed.

Is SOULI a word? It might be obscure. SOULI is not common. Better SOLID.

What about: SOLID, SOLDI, SOLID is the common word.

Another possibility: if we don't have position1 as S, but as something else? Pattern: _ O S I _ -> but we need a word with positions fixed: ? O S I ?

We have: letters: unknown1, O, S, I, unknown5.

Words: POSIT is invalid because T is forbidden. Other words: FOSIS? Not valid. ROSIN? But R is forbidden? And N is forbidden? Forget.

Similarly, D OSIS? Not a word.

Or HOWIS? Not valid.

So probably SOLID is a good choice.

But we also have another pattern: _ O _ I S -> then word must be ? O ? I S? Examples: DOVIS? Not word. LOGIS? LOGIS is not common. Other: BOXIS? Not valid.

Or: FOWIS? No.

So SOLID seems a good candidate.

But we must consider: the feedback does not rule out duplicates? What if the word has two O's? But we guessed O and got ✓, so only one O? Not necessarily, but we have no information.

In SOLID, there's one O.

Now, let me check: guess SOLID.

If the secret word is SOLID, then:
- O at position2: ✓
- I at position4: so not at position3 -> matches our feedback
- S at position1: so not at position4 -> matches
- L and D: we haven't tested yet.

But even if SOLID is correct, it might not be, so we want to test letters.

Another candidate: GOUIS? Not a word.

Or PIOUS? But in PIOUS: P I O U S -> no, structure: second letter O? But P I O U S: position2 is I? Not O.

We need second letter O.

Another candidate: SHOWN? But has W and N -> N forbidden? Forget.

Perhaps: SOLVE? But V is new? SOLVE: S O L V E -> but E is forbidden? And E is forbidden? Yes, E is forbidden because it was in ""crane"" and got x. So SOLVE must not use E.

Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,T.

Therefore, SOLID: D is allowed? Yes.

Another possibility: SOUPY? But has Y? And no I? Doesn't have I? We must have I in the word? So cannot.

Thus, SOLID is a good guess.

Another word: DOZIL? Not a common word.

Or FOXIL? Not valid.

I think SOLID is the best so far.

We can try: SOLID.

But note: after three guesses, we'll get more information.

Other words similar: SKOLL? But no I? Must have I.

Only SOLID comes to mind.

What about: BLOWY? But no I and S? Impossible.

LOUIE? But E forbidden? And structure: L O U I E -> E forbidden? And position2 is O? But LOUIE: L O U I E -> E forbidden? So ""LOUIE"" has E? And E is forbidden? So no.

Perhaps: IOPUS? Not word.

So I'll go with SOLID.

Therefore, guess: solid

But note: in SOLID, we have S at position1, which we know is correct? Not necessarily, because the feedback said S is in the word but not at position4. So position1 is possible.

But we don't know if S is actually at position1 or not? We are guessing it might be.

We can also consider a word that puts S in position3 or position5 to test.

For example, we can try a word that places S in position3? But in the pattern we have possibility: _ O S _ I -> but what words exist? For example, POSIT (invalid due to T), MOSSI? Not word.

Perhaps: DOSSY -> but not common and D O S S Y -> but no I? Must have I? DOSSY doesn't have I.

So if we put S at position3, and I at position5: _ O S _ I -> for example, FOSSI? Not valid. How about ""JOSSY""? and I? Not.

So let's stick with SOLID.

We might also try: HIOIS? Not valid.

Therefore, I'll guess ""solid"".

<guess>solid</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": Letters C, R, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word.
- From ""moist"":
  - O is correct and in position 2 (second letter).
  - I is present but not in position 3.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M and T are **not** in the secret word.

This means:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ O _ _ _`.
- It contains both I and S, but I cannot be in position 3 and S cannot be in position 4.
- The remaining letters must avoid forbidden characters: C, R, A, N, E, M, T.

Considering possible words that fit these constraints, ""solid"" (S at position 1, O at position 2, L at position 3, I at position 4, D at position 5) meets the criteria:
- O is in position 2 as required.
- I is present (position 4), avoiding position 3.
- S is present (position 1), avoiding position 4.
- Uses new letters L and D for further testing.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

This guess should provide valuable feedback on letter positions while testing new characters.",Guess 3: solid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) L(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
