We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often used.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of common letters.

 So, the first guess is: RAISE

We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x -> R is not in the secret word.
 A: x -> A is not in the secret word.
 I: x -> I is not in the secret word.
 S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.

 Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.

 Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.

 Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.

 We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

 We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.

 The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.

 We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.

 For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven't been tried. And we also want to test other letters.

 We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.

 Let's think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.

 Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don't know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn't specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let's assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.

 Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked '-' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).

 Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?

 Alternatively, let's look for words that have E and S in different positions.

 Common words: 
 Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.

 But we must not use R, A, I.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:

 ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. 
 So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.

 However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That's okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.

 Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).

 We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either '-' or 'x'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn't have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.

 Similarly, avoid S at position 4.

 So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it's in 1) and E not in 5 (it's in 3? wait, ""spend"": 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: E
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: D

 Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that's okay.

 But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.

 Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.

 Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? 
 ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? 
 But we must check: 
 - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. 
 - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? 
 However, we don't know if E is at 4? It might be.

 But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven't tested T, O, N. 
 Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.

 Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.

 Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.

 Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.

 So ""house"": 
 H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.

 So let's go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That's good.

 Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? 
 S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: 
 S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.

 Then E is at position 3? Same as above.

 Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.

 But let me confirm: 
 ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

 We can use ""spend"". We haven't tested P, N, D.

 Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.

 But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? 

 We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:

 ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don't know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? 
 S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it's wrong? We don't want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S's? 

 We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? 

 So let me stick with distinct letters.

 Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? 
 N, O, T, E, S -> positions: 
 Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.
 Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? 
 This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn't forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn't say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn't at position5) and S at 5? 
 So that seems okay.

 But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn't test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn't test S at position5? 

 We want to cover new positions.

 In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? 

 So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? 

 Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?

 Both seem okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.

 But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don't know about other letters? 

 However, we don't have constraints on the other letters? 

 Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.

 We have two letters: S and E. 

 We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? 

 Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? 

 Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? 
 Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that's okay.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.

 But we didn't test O and Y? 

 Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.

 ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That's not allowed.

 So we skip.

 ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can't use R.

 Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that's okay? 
 But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? 
 Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). 
 However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it's present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.

 So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? 

 After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: 
 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 Position1: N -> new
 Position2: O -> new
 Position3: T -> new
 Position4: E -> we haven't tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? 
 Position5: S -> we haven't tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.

 So we test E at position4 and S at position5? 

 We might gain more information.

 Alternatively, ""spend"": 
 Position1: S -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
 Position2: P
 Position3: E -> we haven't tested E at position3? 
 Position4: N
 Position5: D

 This also tests S at1 and E at3? 

 Both are valid.

 But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? 

 Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don't know. 

 We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? 

 But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? 

 In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn't test? 

 But ""spend"" also does that? 

 However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? 

 After some thought, we decide:

 Let's go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? 

 Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) 

 Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> 
 Position1: T
 Position2: O
 Position3: N
 Position4: E
 Position5: S

 But then we are testing T and O? 

 Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.

 Same as above? 

 Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? 

 We'll go with ""notes"".

 But wait: ""notes"" is a word.

 So I decide to guess ""notes"".

 But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? 

 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it's safe.

 We might get:
 - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with '-' or '✓'? But we are guessing position5? 
 Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with '-' or '✓'? 

 We don't know? But that's the point: we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
 Positions: 
 1: O
 2: N
 3: S
 4: E
 5: T

 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? 

 But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven't tested? 

 Is ""onset"" common? Yes.

 However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". 

 But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? 

 Actually, same set of letters? 

 Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.

 So let's go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? 

 We decide: let's choose ""onset"".

 Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? 
 Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": 
 S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)
 Then S at position1? E at position3? 
 And we avoid position4 for S? (we don't put S at4)? 
 And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? 

 This tests S at1? E at3? 

 This is also good.

 But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? 

 After consideration, let's pick ""onset"": 
 O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)

 This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? 

 We have not tested E at position4? 

 And we are avoiding R,A,I.

 So we choose ""onset"".

 Let me confirm: 
 Secret word contains E and S? We are putting E at position4 and S at position3? 

 Also, we are introducing O, N, T? 

 Yes.

 So the guess is ""onset"".

 Response: <guess>onset</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R, A, and I are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include S and E (since they exist in the secret word).
- Must **not** include R, A, or I.
- Must place S in a position other than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Must place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).

After evaluating options, ""onset"" (O-N-S-E-T) fits well:
- Places S in position 3 (a new position, avoiding 4).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position, avoiding 5).
- Uses common letters O, N, and T for additional coverage.
- Contains no R, A, or I.

This will test S and E in untried positions while introducing new letters (O, N, T).

<guess>onset</guess>",onset,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x -> R is not in the secret word.
 A: x -> A is not in the secret word.
 I: x -> I is not in the secret word.
 S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.

 Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.

 Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.

 Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.

 We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

 We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.

 The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.

 We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.

 For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven't been tried. And we also want to test other letters.

 We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.

 Let's think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.

 Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don't know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn't specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let's assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.

 Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked '-' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).

 Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?

 Alternatively, let's look for words that have E and S in different positions.

 Common words: 
 Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.

 But we must not use R, A, I.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:

 ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. 
 So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.

 However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That's okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.

 Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).

 We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either '-' or 'x'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn't have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.

 Similarly, avoid S at position 4.

 So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it's in 1) and E not in 5 (it's in 3? wait, ""spend"": 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: E
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: D

 Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that's okay.

 But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.

 Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.

 Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? 
 ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? 
 But we must check: 
 - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. 
 - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? 
 However, we don't know if E is at 4? It might be.

 But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven't tested T, O, N. 
 Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.

 Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.

 Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.

 Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.

 So ""house"": 
 H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.

 So let's go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That's good.

 Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? 
 S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: 
 S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.

 Then E is at position 3? Same as above.

 Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.

 But let me confirm: 
 ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

 We can use ""spend"". We haven't tested P, N, D.

 Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.

 But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? 

 We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:

 ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don't know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? 
 S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it's wrong? We don't want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S's? 

 We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? 

 So let me stick with distinct letters.

 Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? 
 N, O, T, E, S -> positions: 
 Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.
 Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? 
 This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn't forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn't say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn't at position5) and S at 5? 
 So that seems okay.

 But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn't test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn't test S at position5? 

 We want to cover new positions.

 In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? 

 So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? 

 Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?

 Both seem okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.

 But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don't know about other letters? 

 However, we don't have constraints on the other letters? 

 Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.

 We have two letters: S and E. 

 We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? 

 Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? 

 Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? 
 Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that's okay.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.

 But we didn't test O and Y? 

 Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.

 ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That's not allowed.

 So we skip.

 ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can't use R.

 Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that's okay? 
 But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? 
 Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). 
 However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it's present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.

 So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? 

 After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: 
 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 Position1: N -> new
 Position2: O -> new
 Position3: T -> new
 Position4: E -> we haven't tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? 
 Position5: S -> we haven't tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.

 So we test E at position4 and S at position5? 

 We might gain more information.

 Alternatively, ""spend"": 
 Position1: S -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
 Position2: P
 Position3: E -> we haven't tested E at position3? 
 Position4: N
 Position5: D

 This also tests S at1 and E at3? 

 Both are valid.

 But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? 

 Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don't know. 

 We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? 

 But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? 

 In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn't test? 

 But ""spend"" also does that? 

 However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? 

 After some thought, we decide:

 Let's go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? 

 Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) 

 Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> 
 Position1: T
 Position2: O
 Position3: N
 Position4: E
 Position5: S

 But then we are testing T and O? 

 Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.

 Same as above? 

 Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? 

 We'll go with ""notes"".

 But wait: ""notes"" is a word.

 So I decide to guess ""notes"".

 But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? 

 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it's safe.

 We might get:
 - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with '-' or '✓'? But we are guessing position5? 
 Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with '-' or '✓'? 

 We don't know? But that's the point: we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
 Positions: 
 1: O
 2: N
 3: S
 4: E
 5: T

 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? 

 But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven't tested? 

 Is ""onset"" common? Yes.

 However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". 

 But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? 

 Actually, same set of letters? 

 Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.

 So let's go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? 

 We decide: let's choose ""onset"".

 Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? 
 Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": 
 S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)
 Then S at position1? E at position3? 
 And we avoid position4 for S? (we don't put S at4)? 
 And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? 

 This tests S at1? E at3? 

 This is also good.

 But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? 

 After consideration, let's pick ""onset"": 
 O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)

 This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? 

 We have not tested E at position4? 

 And we are avoiding R,A,I.

 So we choose ""onset"".

 Let me confirm: 
 Secret word contains E and S? We are putting E at position4 and S at position3? 

 Also, we are introducing O, N, T? 

 Yes.

 So the guess is ""onset"".

 Response: <guess>onset</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R, A, and I are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include S and E (since they exist in the secret word).
- Must **not** include R, A, or I.
- Must place S in a position other than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Must place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).

After evaluating options, ""onset"" (O-N-S-E-T) fits well:
- Places S in position 3 (a new position, avoiding 4).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position, avoiding 5).
- Uses common letters O, N, and T for additional coverage.
- Contains no R, A, or I.

This will test S and E in untried positions while introducing new letters (O, N, T).",Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(x) S(-) E(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,shelf,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often used.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of common letters.

 So, the first guess is: RAISE

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x -> R is not in the secret word.
 A: x -> A is not in the secret word.
 I: x -> I is not in the secret word.
 S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.

 Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.

 Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.

 Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.

 We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

 We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.

 The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.

 We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.

 For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven't been tried. And we also want to test other letters.

 We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.

 Let's think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.

 Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don't know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn't specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let's assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.

 Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked '-' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).

 Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?

 Alternatively, let's look for words that have E and S in different positions.

 Common words: 
 Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.

 But we must not use R, A, I.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:

 ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. 
 So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.

 However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That's okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.

 Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).

 We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either '-' or 'x'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn't have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.

 Similarly, avoid S at position 4.

 So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it's in 1) and E not in 5 (it's in 3? wait, ""spend"": 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: E
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: D

 Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that's okay.

 But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.

 Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.

 Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? 
 ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? 
 But we must check: 
 - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. 
 - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? 
 However, we don't know if E is at 4? It might be.

 But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven't tested T, O, N. 
 Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.

 Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.

 Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.

 Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.

 So ""house"": 
 H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.

 So let's go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That's good.

 Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? 
 S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: 
 S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.

 Then E is at position 3? Same as above.

 Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.

 But let me confirm: 
 ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

 We can use ""spend"". We haven't tested P, N, D.

 Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.

 But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? 

 We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:

 ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don't know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? 
 S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it's wrong? We don't want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S's? 

 We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? 

 So let me stick with distinct letters.

 Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? 
 N, O, T, E, S -> positions: 
 Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.
 Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? 
 This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn't forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn't say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn't at position5) and S at 5? 
 So that seems okay.

 But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn't test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn't test S at position5? 

 We want to cover new positions.

 In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? 

 So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? 

 Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?

 Both seem okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.

 But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don't know about other letters? 

 However, we don't have constraints on the other letters? 

 Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.

 We have two letters: S and E. 

 We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? 

 Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? 

 Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? 
 Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that's okay.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.

 But we didn't test O and Y? 

 Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.

 ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That's not allowed.

 So we skip.

 ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can't use R.

 Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that's okay? 
 But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? 
 Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). 
 However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it's present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.

 So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? 

 After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: 
 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 Position1: N -> new
 Position2: O -> new
 Position3: T -> new
 Position4: E -> we haven't tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? 
 Position5: S -> we haven't tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.

 So we test E at position4 and S at position5? 

 We might gain more information.

 Alternatively, ""spend"": 
 Position1: S -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
 Position2: P
 Position3: E -> we haven't tested E at position3? 
 Position4: N
 Position5: D

 This also tests S at1 and E at3? 

 Both are valid.

 But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? 

 Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don't know. 

 We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? 

 But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? 

 In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn't test? 

 But ""spend"" also does that? 

 However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? 

 After some thought, we decide:

 Let's go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? 

 Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) 

 Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> 
 Position1: T
 Position2: O
 Position3: N
 Position4: E
 Position5: S

 But then we are testing T and O? 

 Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.

 Same as above? 

 Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? 

 We'll go with ""notes"".

 But wait: ""notes"" is a word.

 So I decide to guess ""notes"".

 But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? 

 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it's safe.

 We might get:
 - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with '-' or '✓'? But we are guessing position5? 
 Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with '-' or '✓'? 

 We don't know? But that's the point: we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
 Positions: 
 1: O
 2: N
 3: S
 4: E
 5: T

 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? 

 But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven't tested? 

 Is ""onset"" common? Yes.

 However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". 

 But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? 

 Actually, same set of letters? 

 Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.

 So let's go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? 

 We decide: let's choose ""onset"".

 Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? 
 Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": 
 S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)
 Then S at position1? E at position3? 
 And we avoid position4 for S? (we don't put S at4)? 
 And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? 

 This tests S at1? E at3? 

 This is also good.

 But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? 

 After consideration, let's pick ""onset"": 
 O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)

 This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? 

 We have not tested E at position4? 

 And we are avoiding R,A,I.

 So we choose ""onset"".

 Let me confirm: 
 Secret word contains E and S? We are putting E at position4 and S at position3? 

 Also, we are introducing O, N, T? 

 Yes.

 So the guess is ""onset"".

 Response: <guess>onset</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R, A, and I are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include S and E (since they exist in the secret word).
- Must **not** include R, A, or I.
- Must place S in a position other than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Must place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).

After evaluating options, ""onset"" (O-N-S-E-T) fits well:
- Places S in position 3 (a new position, avoiding 4).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position, avoiding 5).
- Uses common letters O, N, and T for additional coverage.
- Contains no R, A, or I.

This will test S and E in untried positions while introducing new letters (O, N, T).

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.\n Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U\n Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.\n\n A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often used.\n\n Let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of common letters.\n\n So, the first guess is: RAISE\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n R: x -> R is not in the secret word.\n A: x -> A is not in the secret word.\n I: x -> I is not in the secret word.\n S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\n So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.\n\n Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.\n\n Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.\n\n Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.\n\n We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.\n\n We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.\n\n The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.\n\n We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.\n\n For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven\'t been tried. And we also want to test other letters.\n\n We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.\n\n Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don\'t know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn\'t specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let\'s assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.\n\n Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked \'-\' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).\n\n Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?\n\n Alternatively, let\'s look for words that have E and S in different positions.\n\n Common words: \n Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.\n\n But we must not use R, A, I.\n\n Let\'s list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:\n\n ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? \n Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. \n So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.\n\n However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That\'s okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.\n\n Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).\n\n We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.\n\n Similarly, avoid S at position 4.\n\n So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it\'s in 1) and E not in 5 (it\'s in 3? wait, ""spend"": \n Position 1: S\n Position 2: P\n Position 3: E\n Position 4: N\n Position 5: D\n\n Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that\'s okay.\n\n But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.\n\n Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.\n\n Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? \n ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? \n But we must check: \n - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. \n - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? \n However, we don\'t know if E is at 4? It might be.\n\n But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven\'t tested T, O, N. \n Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.\n\n Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.\n\n However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.\n\n Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.\n\n Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\n So ""house"": \n H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.\n\n So let\'s go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That\'s good.\n\n Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? \n S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? \n Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: \n S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.\n\n Then E is at position 3? Same as above.\n\n Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.\n\n But let me confirm: \n ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.\n\n We can use ""spend"". We haven\'t tested P, N, D.\n\n Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.\n\n But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? \n\n We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:\n\n ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don\'t know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? \n S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it\'s wrong? We don\'t want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S\'s? \n\n We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? \n\n So let me stick with distinct letters.\n\n Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? \n N, O, T, E, S -> positions: \n Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.\n Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? \n This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn\'t forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn\'t say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn\'t at position5) and S at 5? \n So that seems okay.\n\n But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn\'t test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn\'t test S at position5? \n\n We want to cover new positions.\n\n In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? \n\n So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? \n\n Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?\n\n Both seem okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.\n\n But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don\'t know about other letters? \n\n However, we don\'t have constraints on the other letters? \n\n Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.\n\n We have two letters: S and E. \n\n We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? \n\n Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? \n\n Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? \n Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n Then S at position3? And E at position4? \n We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that\'s okay.\n\n However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.\n\n But we didn\'t test O and Y? \n\n Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.\n\n ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That\'s not allowed.\n\n So we skip.\n\n ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can\'t use R.\n\n Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that\'s okay? \n But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? \n Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). \n However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it\'s present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.\n\n So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? \n\n After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: \n ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> \n Position1: N -> new\n Position2: O -> new\n Position3: T -> new\n Position4: E -> we haven\'t tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? \n Position5: S -> we haven\'t tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.\n\n So we test E at position4 and S at position5? \n\n We might gain more information.\n\n Alternatively, ""spend"": \n Position1: S -> we haven\'t tested S at position1? \n Position2: P\n Position3: E -> we haven\'t tested E at position3? \n Position4: N\n Position5: D\n\n This also tests S at1 and E at3? \n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? \n\n Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don\'t know. \n\n We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? \n\n But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? \n\n In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn\'t test? \n\n But ""spend"" also does that? \n\n However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? \n\n After some thought, we decide:\n\n Let\'s go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? \n\n Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) \n\n Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> \n Position1: T\n Position2: O\n Position3: N\n Position4: E\n Position5: S\n\n But then we are testing T and O? \n\n Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> \n 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.\n\n Same as above? \n\n Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? \n\n We\'ll go with ""notes"".\n\n But wait: ""notes"" is a word.\n\n So I decide to guess ""notes"".\n\n But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? \n\n ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it\'s safe.\n\n We might get:\n - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? But we are guessing position5? \n Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? \n\n We don\'t know? But that\'s the point: we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> \n Positions: \n 1: O\n 2: N\n 3: S\n 4: E\n 5: T\n\n Then S at position3? And E at position4? \n Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? \n Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? \n\n But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\n Is ""onset"" common? Yes.\n\n However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". \n\n But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? \n\n Actually, same set of letters? \n\n Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.\n\n So let\'s go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? \n\n We decide: let\'s choose ""onset"".\n\n Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? \n Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? \n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": \n S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)\n Then S at position1? E at position3? \n And we avoid position4 for S? (we don\'t put S at4)? \n And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? \n\n This tests S at1? E at3? \n\n This is also good.\n\n But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? \n\n After consideration, let\'s pick ""onset"": \n O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? \n\n We have not tested E at position4? \n\n And we are avoiding R,A,I.\n\n So we choose ""onset"".\n\n Let me confirm: \n Secret word contains E and S?

We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 3)  [since it was in position 3 in ""onset""]
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 in ""onset""]
- T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
Present letters (but position unknown): S, E

We also know:
- S is not in position 3 (from ""onset"") and not in position 4 (from ""raise""). Since the word is 5 letters, S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- E is not in position 4 (from ""onset"") and not in position 5 (from ""raise""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Additionally, we have used 8 letters that are absent (R, A, I, O, N, T) and 2 that are present (S, E). There are 3 more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 2 known).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes S and E (since they are in the word)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
- Places S in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 5 (avoiding 3 and 4)
- Places E in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5)

We also want to test new letters to cover more ground.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have two known letters (S and E) and three unknown letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we have left that we can use is U (since A, I, O are out, and E is already included). We might also use Y as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have E, and possibly others.

We can try to form words with S and E and three new consonants.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

But note: S and E cannot be in the same position? They are different letters.

We need to choose a word that satisfies the constraints.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then the word would be S E _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three with letters not in {R,A,I,O,N,T} and form a valid word.

Example: ""seedy""? But has duplicate E? And Y? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't show duplicate, so maybe the word has only one E? But we don't know for sure. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""seize""? But has I? I is absent.

""serve""? But has R? R is absent.

""seems""? But has M? And duplicate E? 

""seems"" is S-E-E-M-S? Duplicate E and S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have S already known to be present, and we are putting two S? That might be possible? But let's avoid for now.

""sepal""? S-E-P-A-L -> but A is absent? 

""sedan""? A is absent.

""sewed"": S-E-W-E-D -> duplicate E? 

""seems"" is not good.

Option 2: Place S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

Words: ""sleek""? But has L, E, K? But duplicate E? 
""slice""? I is absent.
""spree""? R and duplicate E? 
""spoke""? O is absent.
""spike""? I is absent.
""spume""? U? S-P-U-M-E -> that could work? 
But we have S at 1, E at 5? Wait: ""spume"": S(1), P(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). 
But we are placing E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? Because from the first guess, E was at 5 and marked '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? 

So we must avoid E at position 5? Therefore, in this structure, if we put E at the end, it's invalid.

So for E, we must put it in positions 1, 2, or 3? So in the pattern S _ E _ _, we are putting E at 3? Then the last two positions are unknown? 

But then we cannot put E at the end? So the word must have E in the first three positions? 

So for S at 1 and E at 3: 
S _ E _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two? 

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T is absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smell""? S-M-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""skew""? not 5 letters.

""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

""sheet""? S-H-E-E-T -> duplicate E and T absent? 

""sheen""? S-H-E-E-N -> duplicate E and N absent? 

""sheer""? R absent.

""steel""? S-T-E-E-L -> T absent and duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? Then: E S _ _ _

Words: ""essay""? E-S-S-A-Y -> duplicate S and A absent? 
""ester""? E-S-T-E-R -> T and R absent? 
""esker""? E-S-K-E-R -> duplicate E and R absent? 

Not good.

Place S at position 2 and E at position 3? Then: _ E S _ _

Words: ""pesky""? P-E-S-K-Y -> that could work? 
But we have E at 2 and S at 3? 
And we are avoiding absent letters? P, S, K, Y are not absent? 
But we have to check: 
P: not tried? 
K: not tried? 
Y: not tried? 
So ""pesky"" is P-E-S-K-Y.

But note: we are putting S at position 3? But from the second guess, we had S at position 3 and it was marked '-' meaning S is not at position 3? So we cannot put S at position 3 again? 

Therefore, we must avoid S at position 3? 

Similarly, we must avoid E at position 4? 

So we cannot use S at position 3? 

Therefore, the only possibilities for S are positions 1, 2, or 5? But we just saw that position 3 is forbidden? 

Yes, from ""onset"": S was at 3 and got '-', so S is not at 3.

Similarly, for E: we cannot use position 4 (from ""onset"") and position 5 (from ""raise""), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3? But we also cannot use E at position 4? 

So E: positions 1, 2, 3 are allowed? 

But we cannot put S at 3? So if we put E at 3, that's okay? Because E and S are different? 

But we are not putting S at 3? We are putting E at 3? 

So let's try:

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: S E _ _ _

We need to fill the last three? 

Words: ""sebum""? S-E-B-U-M -> B, U, M? 
""sebum"" is a word? It means a fatty substance? 
But we can use it? 

But let's see: 
S at 1: allowed? 
E at 2: allowed? 
Then B, U, M? 

But we don't know if these are in the word? 

Another: ""sedum""? S-E-D-U-M -> D, U, M? 
""sedum"" is a plant? 

But we have to avoid duplicate? 

Another: ""sebum"", ""sedum"", ""secus"" (not common)? 

""seedy""? duplicate E? 

""seize""? I absent? 

""septa""? A absent? 

""septa"" has A? 

""sepal"" has A? 

""sepia""? S-E-P-I-A -> I and A absent? 

Not good.

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

We need to fill position 2 and 4,5? 

Words: ""suede""? S-U-E-D-E -> duplicate E? 
""shlep""? S-H-L-E-P -> then E at 4? But we are putting E at 3? 
""shlep"" is S-H-L-E-P -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:L, 4:E, 5:P? 
But we are trying to put E at 3? So that doesn't match? 

We need E at position 3? 

So: S _ E _ _

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smelt""? S-M-E-L-T -> T absent? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 1? Then: E _ _ _ S

Words: ""echos""? E-C-H-O-S -> O absent? 
""edits""? E-D-I-T-S -> I and T absent? 
""egads""? E-G-A-D-S -> A absent? 
""eject""? E-J-E-C-T -> duplicate E? 
""elans""? E-L-A-N-S -> A and N absent? 
""emits""? E-M-I-T-S -> I and T absent? 
""euros""? E-U-R-O-S -> R and O absent? 
""evens""? E-V-E-N-S -> duplicate E and N absent? 

Not many options.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 2? Then: _ E _ _ S

Words: ""bless""? B-L-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""chess""? C-H-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""dress""? D-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""guess""? G-U-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""messy""? M-E-S-S-Y -> duplicate S? 
""press""? P-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""tress""? T-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and T absent? 

Many have duplicate S? 

""yeesh""? Y-E-E-S-H -> duplicate E? 

""leaks""? L-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""peaks""? P-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""teaks""? T-E-A-K-S -> T and A absent? 

""weeks""? W-E-E-K-S -> duplicate E? 

""reaps""? R-E-A-P-S -> R and A absent? 

""heaps""? H-E-A-P-S -> A absent? 

""neaps""? N-E-A-P-S -> N and A absent? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E _ S

Words: ""cubes""? C-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""dukes""? D-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""fumes""? F-U-M-E-S -> that could work? 
""gules""? G-U-L-E-S -> that could work? 
""homes""? H-O-M-E-S -> O absent? 
""lubes""? L-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""mikes""? M-I-K-E-S -> I absent? 
""pukes""? P-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""tunes""? T-U-N-E-S -> T and N absent? 
""zones""? Z-O-N-E-S -> O and N absent? 

So we have candidates: ""cubes"", ""dukes"", ""fumes"", ""gules"", ""lubes"", ""pukes""

We can choose one that uses common letters? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

We have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T

So from the list:
- ""cubes"": C, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""dukes"": D, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""fumes"": F, U, M, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""gules"": G, U, L, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""lubes"": L, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""pukes"": P, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 

All are valid? 

We can choose ""fumes"" because F and M are common? 

But we also have U? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel U? 

But we don't know if U is in the word? 

We are trying to find out.

Another thing: we are putting S at position 5? That is allowed? And E at position 3? That is allowed? 

Yes.

So let's choose ""fumes"": F-U-M-E-S

Positions:
1: F
2: U
3: E
4: M
5: S

This way:
- S is at position 5 (which is allowed: not 3 or 4)
- E is at position 3 (which is allowed: not 4 or 5)
- We test new letters: F, U, M

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So the guess is ""fumes""

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U? But that's okay, we are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cubes"" or ""dukes""? 

I think ""fumes"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common consonants? 

Another option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? But we tried that and didn't find many words? 

Or S at position 2 and E at position 3? But we cannot because S at position 2 is allowed? But then the word would be _ S E _ _

And we need to fill the first and last two? 

Example: ""usher""? U-S-H-E-R -> R absent? 
""islet""? I absent? 
""asset""? A absent? 
""unset""? U-N-S-E-T -> N and T absent? 
""upset""? U-P-S-E-T -> T absent? 
""mosey""? M-O-S-E-Y -> O absent? 

Not working.

So I think the best is to go with S at 5 and E at 3? 

We'll guess ""fumes"".

</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""onset""**  
  Feedback: O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O, N, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 3, E not in position 4).  

### Key Insights
1. **Absent Letters (8 total)**: R, A, I, O, N, T (cannot be used in future guesses).  
2. **Present Letters (2 total)**: S and E (must appear in the word, but positions are unknown).  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
4. **Unknown Letters**: 3 letters remain unknown (since the word is 5 letters, and S/E are confirmed). These must be from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Include S and E while respecting position constraints.  
   - Test new common consonants (e.g., F, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid positions where S/E are invalid (e.g., S not in 3/4, E not in 4/5).  

### Evaluating Possible Words
After testing patterns, the most viable option places:  
- **S at position 5** (allowed, as it avoids positions 3/4).  
- **E at position 3** (allowed, as it avoids positions 4/5).  
This gives the pattern: `_ _ E _ S`.  

Suitable words fitting this pattern and excluding absent letters include:  
- **fumes** (F-U-M-E-S): Tests F, U, M (common letters).  
- cubes, dukes, lubes, pukes (other options, but ""fumes"" uses more frequent consonants).  

**Why ""fumes""?**  
- Tests S at position 5 and E at position 3 (new positions for both).  
- Introduces new letters: F, U, M (high-coverage consonants).  
- Avoids duplicates and all absent letters.  

<guess>fumes</guess>",fumes,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 3)  [since it was in position 3 in ""onset""]
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 in ""onset""]
- T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
Present letters (but position unknown): S, E

We also know:
- S is not in position 3 (from ""onset"") and not in position 4 (from ""raise""). Since the word is 5 letters, S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- E is not in position 4 (from ""onset"") and not in position 5 (from ""raise""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Additionally, we have used 8 letters that are absent (R, A, I, O, N, T) and 2 that are present (S, E). There are 3 more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 2 known).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes S and E (since they are in the word)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
- Places S in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 5 (avoiding 3 and 4)
- Places E in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5)

We also want to test new letters to cover more ground.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have two known letters (S and E) and three unknown letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we have left that we can use is U (since A, I, O are out, and E is already included). We might also use Y as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have E, and possibly others.

We can try to form words with S and E and three new consonants.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

But note: S and E cannot be in the same position? They are different letters.

We need to choose a word that satisfies the constraints.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then the word would be S E _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three with letters not in {R,A,I,O,N,T} and form a valid word.

Example: ""seedy""? But has duplicate E? And Y? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't show duplicate, so maybe the word has only one E? But we don't know for sure. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""seize""? But has I? I is absent.

""serve""? But has R? R is absent.

""seems""? But has M? And duplicate E? 

""seems"" is S-E-E-M-S? Duplicate E and S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have S already known to be present, and we are putting two S? That might be possible? But let's avoid for now.

""sepal""? S-E-P-A-L -> but A is absent? 

""sedan""? A is absent.

""sewed"": S-E-W-E-D -> duplicate E? 

""seems"" is not good.

Option 2: Place S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

Words: ""sleek""? But has L, E, K? But duplicate E? 
""slice""? I is absent.
""spree""? R and duplicate E? 
""spoke""? O is absent.
""spike""? I is absent.
""spume""? U? S-P-U-M-E -> that could work? 
But we have S at 1, E at 5? Wait: ""spume"": S(1), P(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). 
But we are placing E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? Because from the first guess, E was at 5 and marked '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? 

So we must avoid E at position 5? Therefore, in this structure, if we put E at the end, it's invalid.

So for E, we must put it in positions 1, 2, or 3? So in the pattern S _ E _ _, we are putting E at 3? Then the last two positions are unknown? 

But then we cannot put E at the end? So the word must have E in the first three positions? 

So for S at 1 and E at 3: 
S _ E _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two? 

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T is absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smell""? S-M-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""skew""? not 5 letters.

""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

""sheet""? S-H-E-E-T -> duplicate E and T absent? 

""sheen""? S-H-E-E-N -> duplicate E and N absent? 

""sheer""? R absent.

""steel""? S-T-E-E-L -> T absent and duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? Then: E S _ _ _

Words: ""essay""? E-S-S-A-Y -> duplicate S and A absent? 
""ester""? E-S-T-E-R -> T and R absent? 
""esker""? E-S-K-E-R -> duplicate E and R absent? 

Not good.

Place S at position 2 and E at position 3? Then: _ E S _ _

Words: ""pesky""? P-E-S-K-Y -> that could work? 
But we have E at 2 and S at 3? 
And we are avoiding absent letters? P, S, K, Y are not absent? 
But we have to check: 
P: not tried? 
K: not tried? 
Y: not tried? 
So ""pesky"" is P-E-S-K-Y.

But note: we are putting S at position 3? But from the second guess, we had S at position 3 and it was marked '-' meaning S is not at position 3? So we cannot put S at position 3 again? 

Therefore, we must avoid S at position 3? 

Similarly, we must avoid E at position 4? 

So we cannot use S at position 3? 

Therefore, the only possibilities for S are positions 1, 2, or 5? But we just saw that position 3 is forbidden? 

Yes, from ""onset"": S was at 3 and got '-', so S is not at 3.

Similarly, for E: we cannot use position 4 (from ""onset"") and position 5 (from ""raise""), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3? But we also cannot use E at position 4? 

So E: positions 1, 2, 3 are allowed? 

But we cannot put S at 3? So if we put E at 3, that's okay? Because E and S are different? 

But we are not putting S at 3? We are putting E at 3? 

So let's try:

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: S E _ _ _

We need to fill the last three? 

Words: ""sebum""? S-E-B-U-M -> B, U, M? 
""sebum"" is a word? It means a fatty substance? 
But we can use it? 

But let's see: 
S at 1: allowed? 
E at 2: allowed? 
Then B, U, M? 

But we don't know if these are in the word? 

Another: ""sedum""? S-E-D-U-M -> D, U, M? 
""sedum"" is a plant? 

But we have to avoid duplicate? 

Another: ""sebum"", ""sedum"", ""secus"" (not common)? 

""seedy""? duplicate E? 

""seize""? I absent? 

""septa""? A absent? 

""septa"" has A? 

""sepal"" has A? 

""sepia""? S-E-P-I-A -> I and A absent? 

Not good.

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

We need to fill position 2 and 4,5? 

Words: ""suede""? S-U-E-D-E -> duplicate E? 
""shlep""? S-H-L-E-P -> then E at 4? But we are putting E at 3? 
""shlep"" is S-H-L-E-P -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:L, 4:E, 5:P? 
But we are trying to put E at 3? So that doesn't match? 

We need E at position 3? 

So: S _ E _ _

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smelt""? S-M-E-L-T -> T absent? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 1? Then: E _ _ _ S

Words: ""echos""? E-C-H-O-S -> O absent? 
""edits""? E-D-I-T-S -> I and T absent?

""euros""? E-U-R-O-S -> R and O absent? 
""evens""? E-V-E-N-S -> duplicate E and N absent? 

Not many options.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 2? Then: _ E _ _ S

Words: ""bless""? B-L-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""chess""? C-H-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""dress""? D-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""guess""? G-U-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""messy""? M-E-S-S-Y -> duplicate S? 
""press""? P-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""tress""? T-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and T absent? 

Many have duplicate S? 

""yeesh""? Y-E-E-S-H -> duplicate E? 

""leaks""? L-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""peaks""? P-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""teaks""? T-E-A-K-S -> T and A absent? 

""weeks""? W-E-E-K-S -> duplicate E? 

""reaps""? R-E-A-P-S -> R and A absent? 

""heaps""? H-E-A-P-S -> A absent? 

""neaps""? N-E-A-P-S -> N and A absent? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E _ S

Words: ""cubes""? C-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""dukes""? D-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""fumes""? F-U-M-E-S -> that could work? 
""gules""? G-U-L-E-S -> that could work? 
""homes""? H-O-M-E-S -> O absent? 
""lubes""? L-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""mikes""? M-I-K-E-S -> I absent? 
""pukes""? P-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""tunes""? T-U-N-E-S -> T and N absent? 
""zones""? Z-O-N-E-S -> O and N absent? 

So we have candidates: ""cubes"", ""dukes"", ""fumes"", ""gules"", ""lubes"", ""pukes""

We can choose one that uses common letters? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

We have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T

So from the list:
- ""cubes"": C, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""dukes"": D, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""fumes"": F, U, M, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""gules"": G, U, L, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""lubes"": L, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""pukes"": P, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 

All are valid? 

We can choose ""fumes"" because F and M are common? 

But we also have U? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel U? 

But we don't know if U is in the word? 

We are trying to find out.

Another thing: we are putting S at position 5? That is allowed? And E at position 3? That is allowed? 

Yes.

So let's choose ""fumes"": F-U-M-E-S

Positions:
1: F
2: U
3: E
4: M
5: S

This way:
- S is at position 5 (which is allowed: not 3 or 4)
- E is at position 3 (which is allowed: not 4 or 5)
- We test new letters: F, U, M

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So the guess is ""fumes""

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U? But that's okay, we are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cubes"" or ""dukes""? 

I think ""fumes"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common consonants? 

Another option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? But we tried that and didn't find many words? 

Or S at position 2 and E at position 3? But we cannot because S at position 2 is allowed? But then the word would be _ S E _ _

And we need to fill the first and last two? 

Example: ""usher""? U-S-H-E-R -> R absent? 
""islet""? I absent? 
""asset""? A absent? 
""unset""? U-N-S-E-T -> N and T absent? 
""upset""? U-P-S-E-T -> T absent? 
""mosey""? M-O-S-E-Y -> O absent? 

Not working.

So I think the best is to go with S at 5 and E at 3? 

We'll guess ""fumes"".

<guess>fumes</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""onset""**  
  Feedback: O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O, N, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 3, E not in position 4).  

### Key Insights
1. **Absent Letters (8 total)**: R, A, I, O, N, T (cannot be used in future guesses).  
2. **Present Letters (2 total)**: S and E (must appear in the word, but positions are unknown).  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
4. **Unknown Letters**: 3 letters remain unknown (since the word is 5 letters, and S/E are confirmed). These must be from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Include S and E while respecting position constraints.  
   - Test new common consonants (e.g., F, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid positions where S/E are invalid (e.g., S not in 3/4, E not in 4/5).  

### Evaluating Possible Words
After testing patterns, the most viable option places:  
- **S at position 5** (allowed, as it avoids positions 3/4).  
- **E at position 3** (allowed, as it avoids positions 4/5).  
This gives the pattern: `_ _ E _ S`.  

Suitable words fitting this pattern and excluding absent letters include:  
- **fumes** (F-U-M-E-S): Tests F, U, M (common letters).  
- cubes, dukes, lubes, pukes (other options, but ""fumes"" uses more frequent consonants).  

**Why ""fumes""?**  
- Tests S at position 5 and E at position 3 (new positions for both).  
- Introduces new letters: F, U, M (high-coverage consonants).  
- Avoids duplicates and all absent letters.",Guess 3: fumes -> FEEDBACK: F(-) U(x) M(x) E(-) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,shelf,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no repeating letters. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often used.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of common letters.

 So, the first guess is: RAISE

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
 R: x -> R is not in the secret word.
 A: x -> A is not in the secret word.
 I: x -> I is not in the secret word.
 S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.

 Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.

 Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.

 Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.

 We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.

 We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.

 The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.

 We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.

 For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven't been tried. And we also want to test other letters.

 We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.

 Let's think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.

 Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don't know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn't specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let's assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.

 Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked '-' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).

 Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?

 Alternatively, let's look for words that have E and S in different positions.

 Common words: 
 Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.

 But we must not use R, A, I.

 Let's list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:

 ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. 
 So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.

 However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That's okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.

 Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).

 We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either '-' or 'x'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn't have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.

 Similarly, avoid S at position 4.

 So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it's in 1) and E not in 5 (it's in 3? wait, ""spend"": 
 Position 1: S
 Position 2: P
 Position 3: E
 Position 4: N
 Position 5: D

 Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that's okay.

 But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.

 Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.

 Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? 
 ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? 
 But we must check: 
 - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. 
 - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? 
 However, we don't know if E is at 4? It might be.

 But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven't tested T, O, N. 
 Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.

 Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.

 Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.

 Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.

 So ""house"": 
 H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.

 So let's go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That's good.

 Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? 
 S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? 
 Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: 
 S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.

 Then E is at position 3? Same as above.

 Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.

 But let me confirm: 
 ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.

 We can use ""spend"". We haven't tested P, N, D.

 Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.

 But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? 

 We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:

 ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don't know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? 
 S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it's wrong? We don't want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S's? 

 We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? 

 So let me stick with distinct letters.

 Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? 
 N, O, T, E, S -> positions: 
 Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.
 Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? 
 This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn't forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn't say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn't at position5) and S at 5? 
 So that seems okay.

 But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn't test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn't test S at position5? 

 We want to cover new positions.

 In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? 

 So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? 

 Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?

 Both seem okay.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.

 But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don't know about other letters? 

 However, we don't have constraints on the other letters? 

 Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.

 We have two letters: S and E. 

 We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? 

 Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? 

 Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? 
 Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that's okay.

 However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.

 But we didn't test O and Y? 

 Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.

 ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That's not allowed.

 So we skip.

 ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can't use R.

 Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that's okay? 
 But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? 
 Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). 
 However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it's present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.

 So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? 

 After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: 
 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 Position1: N -> new
 Position2: O -> new
 Position3: T -> new
 Position4: E -> we haven't tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? 
 Position5: S -> we haven't tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.

 So we test E at position4 and S at position5? 

 We might gain more information.

 Alternatively, ""spend"": 
 Position1: S -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
 Position2: P
 Position3: E -> we haven't tested E at position3? 
 Position4: N
 Position5: D

 This also tests S at1 and E at3? 

 Both are valid.

 But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? 

 Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don't know. 

 We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? 

 But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? 

 In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn't test? 

 But ""spend"" also does that? 

 However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? 

 After some thought, we decide:

 Let's go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? 

 Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) 

 Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> 
 Position1: T
 Position2: O
 Position3: N
 Position4: E
 Position5: S

 But then we are testing T and O? 

 Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> 
 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.

 Same as above? 

 Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? 

 We'll go with ""notes"".

 But wait: ""notes"" is a word.

 So I decide to guess ""notes"".

 But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? 

 ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it's safe.

 We might get:
 - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with '-' or '✓'? But we are guessing position5? 
 Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with '-' or '✓'? 

 We don't know? But that's the point: we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> 
 Positions: 
 1: O
 2: N
 3: S
 4: E
 5: T

 Then S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? 
 Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? 

 But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven't tested? 

 Is ""onset"" common? Yes.

 However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". 

 But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? 

 Actually, same set of letters? 

 Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.

 So let's go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? 

 We decide: let's choose ""onset"".

 Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? 
 Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": 
 S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)
 Then S at position1? E at position3? 
 And we avoid position4 for S? (we don't put S at4)? 
 And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? 

 This tests S at1? E at3? 

 This is also good.

 But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? 

 After consideration, let's pick ""onset"": 
 O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)

 This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? 

 We have not tested E at position4? 

 And we are avoiding R,A,I.

 So we choose ""onset"".

 Let me confirm: 
 Secret word contains E and S? We are putting E at position4 and S at position3? 

 Also, we are introducing O, N, T? 

 Yes.

 So the guess is ""onset"".

 Response: <guess>onset</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):
- R, A, and I are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess, I need:
- A valid 5-letter English word.
- Must include S and E (since they exist in the secret word).
- Must **not** include R, A, or I.
- Must place S in a position other than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Must place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).

After evaluating options, ""onset"" (O-N-S-E-T) fits well:
- Places S in position 3 (a new position, avoiding 4).
- Places E in position 4 (a new position, avoiding 5).
- Uses common letters O, N, and T for additional coverage.
- Contains no R, A, or I.

This will test S and E in untried positions while introducing new letters (O, N, T).

<guess>onset</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(x) S(-) E(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 3)  [since it was in position 3 in ""onset""]
- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 in ""onset""]
- T: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
Present letters (but position unknown): S, E

We also know:
- S is not in position 3 (from ""onset"") and not in position 4 (from ""raise""). Since the word is 5 letters, S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- E is not in position 4 (from ""onset"") and not in position 5 (from ""raise""). So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Additionally, we have used 8 letters that are absent (R, A, I, O, N, T) and 2 that are present (S, E). There are 3 more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 2 known).

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes S and E (since they are in the word)
- Does not include any of the absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T
- Places S in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 5 (avoiding 3 and 4)
- Places E in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5)

We also want to test new letters to cover more ground.

Common letters that haven't been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have two known letters (S and E) and three unknown letters.

We should try to cover common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we have left that we can use is U (since A, I, O are out, and E is already included). We might also use Y as a vowel.

But note: we don't know if the word has more vowels? We have E, and possibly others.

We can try to form words with S and E and three new consonants.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

But note: S and E cannot be in the same position? They are different letters.

We need to choose a word that satisfies the constraints.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then the word would be S E _ _ _

But we need to fill the last three with letters not in {R,A,I,O,N,T} and form a valid word.

Example: ""seedy""? But has duplicate E? And Y? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have only one E so far? The feedback didn't show duplicate, so maybe the word has only one E? But we don't know for sure. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""seize""? But has I? I is absent.

""serve""? But has R? R is absent.

""seems""? But has M? And duplicate E? 

""seems"" is S-E-E-M-S? Duplicate E and S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have S already known to be present, and we are putting two S? That might be possible? But let's avoid for now.

""sepal""? S-E-P-A-L -> but A is absent? 

""sedan""? A is absent.

""sewed"": S-E-W-E-D -> duplicate E? 

""seems"" is not good.

Option 2: Place S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

Words: ""sleek""? But has L, E, K? But duplicate E? 
""slice""? I is absent.
""spree""? R and duplicate E? 
""spoke""? O is absent.
""spike""? I is absent.
""spume""? U? S-P-U-M-E -> that could work? 
But we have S at 1, E at 5? Wait: ""spume"": S(1), P(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). 
But we are placing E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? Because from the first guess, E was at 5 and marked '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? 

So we must avoid E at position 5? Therefore, in this structure, if we put E at the end, it's invalid.

So for E, we must put it in positions 1, 2, or 3? So in the pattern S _ E _ _, we are putting E at 3? Then the last two positions are unknown? 

But then we cannot put E at the end? So the word must have E in the first three positions? 

So for S at 1 and E at 3: 
S _ E _ _

We need to fill the second and the last two? 

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T is absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smell""? S-M-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""skew""? not 5 letters.

""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

""sheet""? S-H-E-E-T -> duplicate E and T absent? 

""sheen""? S-H-E-E-N -> duplicate E and N absent? 

""sheer""? R absent.

""steel""? S-T-E-E-L -> T absent and duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? Then: E S _ _ _

Words: ""essay""? E-S-S-A-Y -> duplicate S and A absent? 
""ester""? E-S-T-E-R -> T and R absent? 
""esker""? E-S-K-E-R -> duplicate E and R absent? 

Not good.

Place S at position 2 and E at position 3? Then: _ E S _ _

Words: ""pesky""? P-E-S-K-Y -> that could work? 
But we have E at 2 and S at 3? 
And we are avoiding absent letters? P, S, K, Y are not absent? 
But we have to check: 
P: not tried? 
K: not tried? 
Y: not tried? 
So ""pesky"" is P-E-S-K-Y.

But note: we are putting S at position 3? But from the second guess, we had S at position 3 and it was marked '-' meaning S is not at position 3? So we cannot put S at position 3 again? 

Therefore, we must avoid S at position 3? 

Similarly, we must avoid E at position 4? 

So we cannot use S at position 3? 

Therefore, the only possibilities for S are positions 1, 2, or 5? But we just saw that position 3 is forbidden? 

Yes, from ""onset"": S was at 3 and got '-', so S is not at 3.

Similarly, for E: we cannot use position 4 (from ""onset"") and position 5 (from ""raise""), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3? But we also cannot use E at position 4? 

So E: positions 1, 2, 3 are allowed? 

But we cannot put S at 3? So if we put E at 3, that's okay? Because E and S are different? 

But we are not putting S at 3? We are putting E at 3? 

So let's try:

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: S E _ _ _

We need to fill the last three? 

Words: ""sebum""? S-E-B-U-M -> B, U, M? 
""sebum"" is a word? It means a fatty substance? 
But we can use it? 

But let's see: 
S at 1: allowed? 
E at 2: allowed? 
Then B, U, M? 

But we don't know if these are in the word? 

Another: ""sedum""? S-E-D-U-M -> D, U, M? 
""sedum"" is a plant? 

But we have to avoid duplicate? 

Another: ""sebum"", ""sedum"", ""secus"" (not common)? 

""seedy""? duplicate E? 

""seize""? I absent? 

""septa""? A absent? 

""septa"" has A? 

""sepal"" has A? 

""sepia""? S-E-P-I-A -> I and A absent? 

Not good.

Option: S at position 1 and E at position 3? Then: S _ E _ _

We need to fill position 2 and 4,5? 

Words: ""suede""? S-U-E-D-E -> duplicate E? 
""shlep""? S-H-L-E-P -> then E at 4? But we are putting E at 3? 
""shlep"" is S-H-L-E-P -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:L, 4:E, 5:P? 
But we are trying to put E at 3? So that doesn't match? 

We need E at position 3? 

So: S _ E _ _

Example: ""swept""? S-W-E-P-T -> but T absent? 
""swell""? S-W-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""smelt""? S-M-E-L-T -> T absent? 
""spell""? S-P-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""shell""? S-H-E-L-L -> duplicate L? 
""sheep""? S-H-E-E-P -> duplicate E? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 1? Then: E _ _ _ S

Words: ""echos""? E-C-H-O-S -> O absent? 
""edits""? E-D-I-T-S -> I and T absent? 
""egads""? E-G-A-D-S -> A absent? 
""eject""? E-J-E-C-T -> duplicate E? 
""elans""? E-L-A-N-S -> A and N absent? 
""emits""? E-M-I-T-S -> I and T absent? 
""euros""? E-U-R-O-S -> R and O absent? 
""evens""? E-V-E-N-S -> duplicate E and N absent? 

Not many options.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 2? Then: _ E _ _ S

Words: ""bless""? B-L-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""chess""? C-H-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""dress""? D-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""guess""? G-U-E-S-S -> duplicate S? 
""messy""? M-E-S-S-Y -> duplicate S? 
""press""? P-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and R absent? 
""tress""? T-R-E-S-S -> duplicate S and T absent? 

Many have duplicate S? 

""yeesh""? Y-E-E-S-H -> duplicate E? 

""leaks""? L-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""peaks""? P-E-A-K-S -> A absent? 

""teaks""? T-E-A-K-S -> T and A absent? 

""weeks""? W-E-E-K-S -> duplicate E? 

""reaps""? R-E-A-P-S -> R and A absent? 

""heaps""? H-E-A-P-S -> A absent? 

""neaps""? N-E-A-P-S -> N and A absent? 

Not working.

Option: S at position 5 and E at position 3? Then: _ _ E _ S

Words: ""cubes""? C-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""dukes""? D-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""fumes""? F-U-M-E-S -> that could work? 
""gules""? G-U-L-E-S -> that could work? 
""homes""? H-O-M-E-S -> O absent? 
""lubes""? L-U-B-E-S -> that could work? 
""mikes""? M-I-K-E-S -> I absent? 
""pukes""? P-U-K-E-S -> that could work? 
""tunes""? T-U-N-E-S -> T and N absent? 
""zones""? Z-O-N-E-S -> O and N absent? 

So we have candidates: ""cubes"", ""dukes"", ""fumes"", ""gules"", ""lubes"", ""pukes""

We can choose one that uses common letters? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

We have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T

So from the list:
- ""cubes"": C, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""dukes"": D, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""fumes"": F, U, M, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""gules"": G, U, L, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""lubes"": L, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? 
- ""pukes"": P, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? 

All are valid? 

We can choose ""fumes"" because F and M are common? 

But we also have U? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel U? 

But we don't know if U is in the word? 

We are trying to find out.

Another thing: we are putting S at position 5? That is allowed? And E at position 3? That is allowed? 

Yes.

So let's choose ""fumes"": F-U-M-E-S

Positions:
1: F
2: U
3: E
4: M
5: S

This way:
- S is at position 5 (which is allowed: not 3 or 4)
- E is at position 3 (which is allowed: not 4 or 5)
- We test new letters: F, U, M

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So the guess is ""fumes""

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has U? But that's okay, we are testing.

Alternatively, we can choose ""cubes"" or ""dukes""? 

I think ""fumes"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common consonants? 

Another option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? But we tried that and didn't find many words? 

Or S at position 2 and E at position 3? But we cannot because S at position 2 is allowed? But then the word would be _ S E _ _

And we need to fill the first and last two? 

Example: ""usher""? U-S-H-E-R -> R absent? 
""islet""? I absent? 
""asset""? A absent? 
""unset""? U-N-S-E-T -> N and T absent? 
""upset""? U-P-S-E-T -> T absent? 
""mosey""? M-O-S-E-Y -> O absent? 

Not working.

So I think the best is to go with S at 5 and E at 3? 

We'll guess ""fumes"".

<guess>fumes</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 4, E not in position 5).  

- **Guess 2: ""onset""**  
  Feedback: O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O, N, T are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - S and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (S not in position 3, E not in position 4).  

### Key Insights
1. **Absent Letters (8 total)**: R, A, I, O, N, T (cannot be used in future guesses).  
2. **Present Letters (2 total)**: S and E (must appear in the word, but positions are unknown).  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
4. **Unknown Letters**: 3 letters remain unknown (since the word is 5 letters, and S/E are confirmed). These must be from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Include S and E while respecting position constraints.  
   - Test new common consonants (e.g., F, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.  
   - Avoid positions where S/E are invalid (e.g., S not in 3/4, E not in 4/5).  

### Evaluating Possible Words
After testing patterns, the most viable option places:  
- **S at position 5** (allowed, as it avoids positions 3/4).  
- **E at position 3** (allowed, as it avoids positions 4/5).  
This gives the pattern: `_ _ E _ S`.  

Suitable words fitting this pattern and excluding absent letters include:  
- **fumes** (F-U-M-E-S): Tests F, U, M (common letters).  
- cubes, dukes, lubes, pukes (other options, but ""fumes"" uses more frequent consonants).  

**Why ""fumes""?**  
- Tests S at position 5 and E at position 3 (new positions for both).  
- Introduces new letters: F, U, M (high-coverage consonants).  
- Avoids duplicates and all absent letters.

Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often used.\n\n Let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help reveal the presence of common letters.\n\n So, the first guess is: RAISE\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n R: x -> R is not in the secret word.\n A: x -> A is not in the secret word.\n I: x -> I is not in the secret word.\n S: - -> S is in the word but in the wrong position.\n E: - -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.\n\n So, the secret word contains S and E, but not in the positions they were in ""raise"". Since ""raise"" was R-A-I-S-E, the S was in the fourth position and E in the fifth. That means S is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth.\n\n Also, the letters R, A, and I are not in the word at all.\n\n Since we have S and E in the word, and we know three letters that are absent (R, A, I), we can try to form a new guess that includes S and E, but not R, A, I.\n\n Moreover, we must place S and E in different positions.\n\n We have two known letters: S and E. We need to guess a 5-letter word that contains S and E, but not R, A, I, and we must avoid putting S at the fourth position and E at the fifth.\n\n We can consider common consonant clusters and other vowels.\n\n The remaining vowels we can use: O, U, and sometimes Y. Also, consonants to consider: we have S and E to include.\n\n We must avoid positions 4 for S and position 5 for E? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, S was in position 4 and that was wrong, so in the secret word S is not at position 4. Similarly, E is not at position 5.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us where else S and E might be. S could be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But wait: the word has 5 letters, so S must be in one of the positions: 1,2,3,5? Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n However, note that we are guessing a word. We must also consider that the feedback for S and E is a ""-"": meaning they are in the word but not in the guessed position.\n\n For our next guess, we should try to place S and E in positions they haven\'t been tried. And we also want to test other letters.\n\n We also have three other positions to fill. We should avoid R, A, I.\n\n Let\'s think of words that have S and E, and avoid R, A, I.\n\n Example: words like ""SPEND"", but we don\'t know if P, N, D are in the word. Alternatively, ""STEEP"" but that has duplicate E? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules didn\'t specify. But the secret word might have duplicate letters? However, since we got only one S and one E in feedback and they were not in their positions, but if the word had duplicate, we would have gotten multiple marks? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But in our case, the word ""raise"" had distinct letters and we only got two ""-"". So the secret is likely without duplicates? Not necessarily, but let\'s assume for now we avoid duplicates in our guess.\n\n Since ""raise"" had S at position 4 and E at position 5, and both were marked \'-\' meaning present but wrong spot, we want our new guess to place S in a new position (not 4) and E in a new position (not 5).\n\n Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5? But if we put S in position 5, then we avoid position 4. Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Or S in the first?\n\n Alternatively, let\'s look for words that have E and S in different positions.\n\n Common words: \n Possible: ""spend"", ""quest"", ""house"", ""teeth"", ""smelt"", ""slice"" (but slice has I and we know I is absent), etc.\n\n But we must not use R, A, I.\n\n Let\'s list some words without R, A, I and with E and S:\n\n ""spend"": S in position 1, E in position 4? \n Positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D. \n So S is at 1 (not the fourth) and E is at 3 (not the fifth). Also no R,A,I.\n\n However, we previously had E at position 5 and now we are putting E at position 3? That\'s okay because the feedback said E was not at position 5, so it might be at position 3.\n\n Similarly, we are putting S at 1 (previously it was at 4).\n\n We can also test other letters: using common consonants like T, N, D, P, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with E? But that would be position 5, and the first feedback said E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5 again? We cannot? Actually, we know E is not at position 5 in the secret word, so if we put a word with E at position 5, then the feedback would mark it as either \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, if we put E at the end, it would not be correct because the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5. So we should avoid putting E at position 5 again.\n\n Similarly, avoid S at position 4.\n\n So ""spend"" avoids both: S not in 4 (it\'s in 1) and E not in 5 (it\'s in 3? wait, ""spend"": \n Position 1: S\n Position 2: P\n Position 3: E\n Position 4: N\n Position 5: D\n\n Actually, the E is at position 3? Then that\'s okay.\n\n But note: we also want to cover more common letters? We have tested S and E, and now we are introducing P, N, D.\n\n Another idea: we also know that the secret word must contain S and E. We have two known letters. We can try to use the same E and S but in different positions and test a set of new consonants.\n\n Another common word: ""tones"" but that has O? And ends with S? \n ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> positions: S is at 5? Then E at 4? \n But we must check: \n - S at 5: not position 4 -> okay. \n - E at 4: which is a new position (from 5 to 4) -> okay? \n However, we don\'t know if E is at 4? It might be.\n\n But the word ""tones"" has T, O, N, E, S. We haven\'t tested T, O, N. \n Also, ""tones"" has S at the end (position 5) which we avoided in the first guess? But the problem is the secret word does have an S, just not at position 4. So position 5 is possible.\n\n Similarly, E at position 4 might be possible.\n\n However, we must avoid R, A, I. ""tones"" does not contain R, A, I.\n\n Another word: ""house"" -> H, O, U, S, E -> S at position 4? But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked wrong. So we cannot try S at position 4 again? The feedback says the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So we know for sure position 4 is not correct for S, so we must try S elsewhere. So ""house"" has S at position 4? That would be exactly the same position we should avoid.\n\n Therefore, we must not put S in position 4 and E in position 5.\n\n So ""house"": \n H(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> S at 4 and E at 5: which we know are wrong. So we avoid.\n\n So let\'s go back to ""spend"": S at 1, E at 3? Then we are putting S in a new position (1) and E in a new position (3). That\'s good.\n\n Another possibility: ""smelt"": S at 1, E at 4? \n S(1), M(2), E(4), L(3)? Wait: ""smelt"" is S-M-E-L-T? \n Positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:E? Wait: \n S, M, E, L, T -> if spelled ""S M E L T"", then position 1:S, 2:M, 3:E, 4:L, 5:T.\n\n Then E is at position 3? Same as above.\n\n Alternatively, ""spelt"": S P E L T -> similar.\n\n But let me confirm: \n ""spend"": S P E N D -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:E, 4:N, 5:D.\n\n We can use ""spend"". We haven\'t tested P, N, D.\n\n Another word: ""census"" but that has duplicate S? We are avoiding duplicates for now? Also ""census"" has U and C.\n\n But I think ""spend"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider words that also try to cover more vowels? We haven\'t tested O or U. We know A, I are absent. So we can try O and U? \n\n We have two known letters: E and S, so we can include O and U? For example:\n\n ""souse"" -> but that has duplicate S? Not good? Because we don\'t know if duplicates are in the secret word? Also it has S at start and end? And E at position 4? \n S(1), O(2), U(3), S(4) -> but we avoid S at position 4? So if we put S at position 4 again, we already know it\'s wrong? We don\'t want to waste a guess? Also, the word has two S\'s? \n\n We want a word with distinct letters? To get more information? \n\n So let me stick with distinct letters.\n\n Another word: ""notes""? But ends with S? \n N, O, T, E, S -> positions: \n Position1: N, position2: O, position3: T, position4: E, position5: S.\n Then we have E at position4? And S at position5? \n This avoids the forbidden positions for S (4) and E (5) because we are putting E at 4 (which wasn\'t forbidden? Actually, the feedback didn\'t say anything about position4 for E? The feedback only said E wasn\'t at position5) and S at 5? \n So that seems okay.\n\n But note: we have E at position4? Previously, we didn\'t test E at position4? And S at position5? We didn\'t test S at position5? \n\n We want to cover new positions.\n\n In fact, the secret word has E somewhere that is not position5. The secret word has E at one of positions 1,2,3,4? Similarly S at one of 1,2,3,5? \n\n So by putting E at position4 and S at position5, we are testing new positions? \n\n Which one is better: ""spend"" or ""notes""?\n\n Both seem okay.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more of the common consonants? T and N are very common.\n\n But we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Not really? We don\'t know about other letters? \n\n However, we don\'t have constraints on the other letters? \n\n Given that we have two letters known, we can try to get information on the remaining three.\n\n We have two letters: S and E. \n\n We can also try a word that has E and S and also includes O and/or U? \n\n Example: ""poule"" is not an English word? \n\n Another word: ""mosey""? M, O, S, E, Y -> that uses Y? \n Positions: M(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n Then S at position3? And E at position4? \n We are avoiding S at 4? Wait, S is at position3? Not 4? And E is at position4? Not 5? So that\'s okay.\n\n However, we must avoid R, A, I. And ""mosey"" is M-O-S-E-Y -> no R,A,I.\n\n But we didn\'t test O and Y? \n\n Alternatively, ""quest"": Q, U, E, S, T -> has Q? Which is rare? But valid.\n\n ""quest"": positions: Q(1), U(2), E(3), S(4) -> we must avoid S at position4? So we cannot put S at 4? Then ""quest"" would have S at position4? That\'s not allowed.\n\n So we skip.\n\n ""store"": S T O R E -> has R? We know R is absent? Because the first guess had R and got x? So we can\'t use R.\n\n Similarly, ""stole"": S? And R? No, that has L? But actually ""stole"": S-T-O-L-E -> no R? So that\'s okay? \n But wait: ""stole"" has O, L, and E? And S? \n Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), E(5). \n However, we must avoid putting E at position5? So if we put ""stole"", then E is at position5? That we know is not correct? Because we got a ""-"" for E meaning it\'s present but not in the fifth? So we must not put E at position5? Thus, ""stole"" is invalid because it has E at 5.\n\n So we need to avoid E at 5 and S at 4? \n\n After evaluating, I think ""notes"" is good: \n ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> \n Position1: N -> new\n Position2: O -> new\n Position3: T -> new\n Position4: E -> we haven\'t tested E at position4? And we know E is not at position5? So position4 might be possible? \n Position5: S -> we haven\'t tested S at position5? And we know S not at position4? Position5 is new.\n\n So we test E at position4 and S at position5? \n\n We might gain more information.\n\n Alternatively, ""spend"": \n Position1: S -> we haven\'t tested S at position1? \n Position2: P\n Position3: E -> we haven\'t tested E at position3? \n Position4: N\n Position5: D\n\n This also tests S at1 and E at3? \n\n Both are valid.\n\n But note: if we choose ""notes"", we are testing O and T? While ""spend"" tests P, N, D? \n\n Since the secret word is in English, T is more common than P? But we don\'t know. \n\n We are making only the second guess. We can choose either? \n\n But also consider: we know that the secret word has E and S. We want to find the positions? \n\n In ""notes"", we are putting E and S at positions that we didn\'t test? \n\n But ""spend"" also does that? \n\n However, if we choose ""spend"", we are placing S at position1 and E at position3? That might be as effective? \n\n After some thought, we decide:\n\n Let\'s go with ""notes"". Why? Because we can test the position for E at the fourth? And S at the end? \n\n Or let me choose ""tones"" (which is same as ""notes"" but T at start?) \n\n Actually, ""tones"": T, O, N, E, S -> \n Position1: T\n Position2: O\n Position3: N\n Position4: E\n Position5: S\n\n But then we are testing T and O? \n\n Alternatively, ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> \n 1:N, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:S.\n\n Same as above? \n\n Actually, ""tones"" and ""notes"" are both valid? But we want distinct? \n\n We\'ll go with ""notes"".\n\n But wait: ""notes"" is a word.\n\n So I decide to guess ""notes"".\n\n But note: we must not use any of R, A, I? \n\n ""notes"": N, O, T, E, S -> none of R,A,I? So it\'s safe.\n\n We might get:\n - If S is at position5, then we get S marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? But we are guessing position5? \n Similarly, if E is at position4, then we get E marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? \n\n We don\'t know? But that\'s the point: we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider ""onset"": O, N, S, E, T -> \n Positions: \n 1: O\n 2: N\n 3: S\n 4: E\n 5: T\n\n Then S at position3? And E at position4? \n Then we are testing S at position3? And E at position4? \n Also, we avoid S position4? And E position5? \n\n But we tested S at position4 and E at position5? Now we try S at position3? And E at position4? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\n Is ""onset"" common? Yes.\n\n However, ""onset"" has the letter N? Same as ""notes"". \n\n But ""onset"" has O, N, S, E, T? \n\n Actually, same set of letters? \n\n Another word: ""using""? But has I? We know I is absent? So avoid.\n\n So let\'s go with ""onset"" or ""notes""? \n\n We decide: let\'s choose ""onset"".\n\n Why? Because in ""onset"", we are putting S at position3 and E at position4? \n Previously, we had S at position4 and E at position5? So we are shifting the positions? \n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""smelt"": \n S(1), M(2), E(3), L(4), T(5)\n Then S at position1? E at position3? \n And we avoid position4 for S? (we don\'t put S at4)? \n And avoid position5 for E? (E is at3, not5)? \n\n This tests S at1? E at3? \n\n This is also good.\n\n But ""smelt"" has M and L? Which are not very common? \n\n After consideration, let\'s pick ""onset"": \n O(1), N(2), S(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n This way, S is at a completely new position (3) and E is at position4? \n\n We have not tested E at position4? \n\n And we are avoiding R,A,I.\n\n So we choose ""onset"".\n\n Let me confirm: \n Secret word contains E and S? We are putting E at position4 and S at position3? \n\n Also, we are introducing O, N, T? \n\n Yes.\n\n So the guess is ""onset"".\n\n Response: <guess>onset</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess (RAISE):\n- R, A, and I are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess, I need:\n- A valid 5-letter English word.\n- Must include S and E (since they exist in the secret word).\n- Must **not** include R, A, or I.\n- Must place S in a position other than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- Must place E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""onset"" (O-N-S-E-T) fits well:\n- Places S in position 3 (a new position, avoiding 4).\n- Places E in position 4 (a new position, avoiding 5).\n- Uses common letters O, N, and T for additional coverage.\n- Contains no R, A, or I.\n\nThis will test S and E in untried positions while introducing new letters (O, N, T).\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(x) S(-) E(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise""\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: - (in the word, but not in position 4)\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""onset""\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- S: - (in the word, but not in position 3)  [since it was in position 3 in ""onset""]\n- E: - (in the word, but not in position 4)  [since it was in position 4 in ""onset""]\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T\nPresent letters (but position unknown): S, E\n\nWe also know:\n- S is not in position 3 (from ""onset"") and not in position 4 (from ""raise"").

So E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have used 8 letters that are absent (R, A, I, O, N, T) and 2 that are present (S, E). There are 3 more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 2 known).\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Includes S and E (since they are in the word)\n- Does not include any of the absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T\n- Places S in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 5 (avoiding 3 and 4)\n- Places E in one of the possible positions: 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding 4 and 5)\n\nWe also want to test new letters to cover more ground.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe have two known letters (S and E) and three unknown letters.\n\nWe should try to cover common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we have left that we can use is U (since A, I, O are out, and E is already included). We might also use Y as a vowel.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has more vowels? We have E, and possibly others.\n\nWe can try to form words with S and E and three new consonants.\n\nPossible positions for S: 1, 2, 5\nPossible positions for E: 1, 2, 3\n\nBut note: S and E cannot be in the same position? They are different letters.\n\nWe need to choose a word that satisfies the constraints.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\nOption 1: Place S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then the word would be S E _ _ _\n\nBut we need to fill the last three with letters not in {R,A,I,O,N,T} and form a valid word.\n\nExample: ""seedy""? But has duplicate E? And Y? Also, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we have only one E so far? The feedback didn\'t show duplicate, so maybe the word has only one E? But we don\'t know for sure.

Wait: ""spume"": S(1), P(2), U(3), M(4), E(5). \nBut we are placing E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5? Because from the first guess, E was at 5 and marked \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? \n\nSo we must avoid E at position 5? Therefore, in this structure, if we put E at the end, it\'s invalid.\n\nSo for E, we must put it in positions 1, 2, or 3? So in the pattern S _ E _ _, we are putting E at 3? Then the last two positions are unknown? \n\nBut then we cannot put E at the end? So the word must have E in the first three positions? \n\nSo for S at 1 and E at 3: \nS _ E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the second and the last two? \n\nExample: ""swept""?

P-E-S-K-Y -> that could work? \nBut we have E at 2 and S at 3? \nAnd we are avoiding absent letters? P, S, K, Y are not absent? \nBut we have to check: \nP: not tried? \nK: not tried? \nY: not tried? \nSo ""pesky"" is P-E-S-K-Y.\n\nBut note: we are putting S at position 3? But from the second guess, we had S at position 3 and it was marked \'-\' meaning S is not at position 3? So we cannot put S at position 3 again? \n\nTherefore, we must avoid S at position 3? \n\nSimilarly, we must avoid E at position 4? \n\nSo we cannot use S at position 3? \n\nTherefore, the only possibilities for S are positions 1, 2, or 5? But we just saw that position 3 is forbidden? \n\nYes, from ""onset"": S was at 3 and got \'-\', so S is not at 3.\n\nSimilarly, for E: we cannot use position 4 (from ""onset"") and position 5 (from ""raise""), so E must be at 1, 2, or 3? But we also cannot use E at position 4? \n\nSo E: positions 1, 2, 3 are allowed? \n\nBut we cannot put S at 3? So if we put E at 3, that\'s okay? Because E and S are different? \n\nBut we are not putting S at 3? We are putting E at 3? \n\nSo let\'s try:\n\nOption: S at position 1 and E at position 2? Then: S E _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the last three? \n\nWords: ""sebum""? S-E-B-U-M -> B, U, M? \n""sebum"" is a word?

Z-O-N-E-S -> O and N absent? \n\nSo we have candidates: ""cubes"", ""dukes"", ""fumes"", ""gules"", ""lubes"", ""pukes""\n\nWe can choose one that uses common letters? \n\nBut we also want to test new letters? \n\nWe have to avoid the absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T\n\nSo from the list:\n- ""cubes"": C, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? \n- ""dukes"": D, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? \n- ""fumes"": F, U, M, E, S -> no absent letters? \n- ""gules"": G, U, L, E, S -> no absent letters? \n- ""lubes"": L, U, B, E, S -> no absent letters? \n- ""pukes"": P, U, K, E, S -> no absent letters? \n\nAll are valid? \n\nWe can choose ""fumes"" because F and M are common? \n\nBut we also have U? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has a vowel U? \n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in the word? \n\nWe are trying to find out.\n\nAnother thing: we are putting S at position 5? That is allowed? And E at position 3? That is allowed? \n\nYes.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""fumes"": F-U-M-E-S\n\nPositions:\n1: F\n2: U\n3: E\n4: M\n5: S\n\nThis way:\n- S is at position 5 (which is allowed: not 3 or 4)\n- E is at position 3 (which is allowed: not 4 or 5)\n- We test new letters: F, U, M\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSo the guess is ""fumes""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has U? But that\'s okay, we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""cubes"" or ""dukes""? \n\nI think ""fumes"" is fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common consonants? \n\nAnother option: Place S at position 2 and E at position 1? But we tried that and didn\'t find many words? \n\nOr S at position 2 and E at position 3? But we cannot because S at position 2 is allowed? But then the word would be _ S E _ _\n\nAnd we need to fill the first and last two? \n\nExample: ""usher""? U-S-H-E-R -> R absent? \n""islet""? I absent? \n""asset""? A absent? \n""unset""?

Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  \n   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n4. **Unknown Letters**: 3 letters remain unknown (since the word is 5 letters, and S/E are confirmed). These must be from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  \n5. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Include S and E while respecting position constraints.  \n   - Test new common consonants (e.g., F, L, M, P, U) to gather more information.  \n   - Avoid positions where S/E are invalid (e.g., S not in 3/4, E not in 4/5).  \n\n### Evaluating Possible Words\nAfter testing patterns, the most viable option places:  \n- **S at position 5** (allowed, as it avoids positions 3/4).  \n- **E at position 3** (allowed, as it avoids positions 4/5).  \nThis gives the pattern: `_ _ E _ S`.  \n\nSuitable words fitting this pattern and excluding absent letters include:  \n- **fumes** (F-U-M-E-S): Tests F, U, M (common letters).  \n- cubes, dukes, lubes, pukes (other options, but ""fumes"" uses more frequent consonants).  \n\n**Why ""fumes""?**  \n- Tests S at position 5 and E at position 3 (new positions for both).  \n- Introduces new letters: F, U, M (high-coverage consonants).  \n- Avoids duplicates and all absent letters.\n\n<guess>fumes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(x) N(x) S(-) E(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: fumes -> FEEDBACK: F(-) U(x) M(x) E(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: raise -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)
Meaning: 
  - R, A, I are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""raise"").
  - E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""raise"").

Guess 2: onset -> O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)
Meaning:
  - O, N, T are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was in ""onset"").
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""onset"").

Guess 3: fumes -> F(-), U(x), M(x), E(-), S(-)
Meaning:
  - F is in the word but not in position 1 (since ""fumes"" had F at 1 and got '-'). 
  - U is not in the word (x).
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since ""fumes"" had E at position 4? Wait, let me check: ""fumes"" is F-U-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? But the feedback is E(-), meaning E is in the word but not at position 4).
  - S is in the word but not in position 5 (since ""fumes"" had S at position 5 and got '-', meaning not at position 5).

Now, summing up:

Known absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T, U, M (from the x's: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M)

Present letters (but position not fully known): 
1. S (seen in every guess, and we know: not at 3,4,5? Wait, from each guess we have restrictions)
   - From guess1: not at pos4.
   - From guess2: not at pos3.
   - From guess3: not at pos5.
   And also, we haven't tried S at pos1 or pos2? But note: we tried in ""onset"" at pos3 and ""fumes"" at pos5? And ""raise"" at pos4? So we have tried positions 3,4,5? But not 1 or 2? 

   Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 2? But wait, we are going to have to try everywhere? Actually, only positions 1 and 2 are left for S? Because we have excluded positions 3,4,5? 

   Similarly for E:
   - From guess1: not at pos5.
   - From guess2: not at pos4.
   - From guess3: not at pos4 (again)? Wait, in ""fumes"", E was at position4? So we get E(-) meaning not at position4? And we already knew that? 

   Also, we tried E at:
   - Guess1: pos5? (in ""raise"", E at pos5, but got '-')
   - Guess2: in ""onset"", E at pos4? got '-'.
   - Guess3: in ""fumes"", E at position4? again? Same as guess2? That's redundant? But the feedback also says E(-) for guess3? So we confirm E not at pos4? 

   Also, we have tried E in position 5 (guess1) and position4 (guess2 and guess3). So we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? 

   But note: in ""fumes"", E was at position4? But we have excluded position4? So E must be in position 1,2, or 3? 

   Now, we also have a new present letter: F. 
   From guess3: F is in the word but not at position1 (because in ""fumes"" it was at1 and got '-').

So we have three present letters: S, E, F? 
And the word has 5 letters? So there are two more? 

But wait: we have three present letters: S, E, F? And two more unknown? 

Now, absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M (8 letters).

So remaining letters are: B,C,D,G,H,K,L,P,V,W,Y, and perhaps others? 

Now, let's summarize position constraints:

For S: 
  - Cannot be at pos3 (from guess2), pos4 (guess1), pos5 (guess3). 
  - So must be at position 1 or 2.

For E:
  - Cannot be at pos4 (guess2 and guess3 confirmed) and pos5 (guess1).
  - So must be at position 1,2, or 3.

For F:
  - Cannot be at position1 (guess3) -> so must be at position 2,3,4, or5? 

But we know the secret word has S, E, F? And we need to assign positions.

Also, we have not placed the other two letters? 

We have used 8 absent letters? And 3 present? So we have 15 letters left? (26-11=15) but we don't care? 

Now, we must form a word that:

- Contains S, E, F? 
- Does not contain R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M?
- Placed such that:
   - S: at position 1 or 2? 
   - E: at position 1,2,3? (but note, we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if S is at1, then E cannot be at1? And vice versa? 

Similarly, F should be placed in positions 2,3,4,5? But we might assign based on the constraints? 

We must form a valid English word.

Let me list the possible patterns:

Case 1: S at position1? 
Then the word: S _ _ _ _

Since E must be at1,2, or3? But position1 is taken by S? So E must be at2 or3? 

And F must be at2,3,4,5? But positions 2 and 3 are possible? 

So two subcases:

Subcase 1a: S at1, E at2? Then: S E _ _ _

We must have F somewhere? But if E is at2, then F cannot be at2? So F can be at3,4,5? 

Now, we have positions 3,4,5 to fill: one of them with F? And the other two with new letters? 

But the word must be valid.

Examples: ""seefy""? Not valid.
""sefka""? Not valid.
""sefly""? Not valid.

Possible words? 

""sebum""? But U present? But U is absent? We know U is absent from ""fumes"" -> U(x). 

So no U? 

""sebum"" has U? Absent.

""sedgy""? S-E-D-G-Y -> D, G, Y? 
Is it a word? Yes? 

But then we must have F? But there is no F? 

This pattern doesn't have F? But we must include F? 

The secret word contains F? So we must have F in the word? 

Therefore, S at1 and E at2: then we must include F in the remaining three? 

For example, ""selfy""? Not a word.
""seffa"" not valid?
""shelf"" -> but that's 5 letters? S-H-E-L-F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? 
But we are putting E at3? But we are talking about E at2? 

If S at1 and E at2? Then we cannot have E at3? 

So for ""shelf"": it would have E at3? But we want E at2? 

What about ""seism""? S-E-I-S-M -> I is absent? And duplicate S? 

Not possible.

What about ""sefer""? S-E-F-E-R? But duplicate E and R absent? Not valid.

So few words with S at1 and E at2 that also include F? 

""serf"" -> only 4 letters? 

""serfs"" -> duplicate S? And R absent? 

No.

Alternative: S at1, E at3? Then: S _ E _ _

Then F can be at2? Or at4? Or5? 

But if F is at2: S F E _ _ 
Then we need to fill? ""sfere""? Not common? 
""sfree""? Not valid.

If F at4: S _ E F _
Then example: ""sdeff"" not valid.
""sheff"" not valid? 
Try: ""shelf"" but then E at3? And F at5? 

S _ E F _ 

Then ""shelf"": S-H-E-L-F -> but that is S at1, H at2, E at3, L at4, F at5? 

Then we have S at1? E at3? F at5? 

But E is at3? Allowed? And F is at5? Allowed? 

But we must use two new letters? H and L? 

And the word exists: ""shelf"" meaning a ledge? 

But is it a word? Yes.

But we have to check: letters: S, H, E, L, F -> no absent letters? (absent: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M? So H,L are fine? )

Yes, H and L are not absent? They haven't been tried? 

Also, E is at position3? Previously, we tried positions: 
- raise: E at5? 
- onset: E at4? 
- fumes: E at4? 

So we haven't tried E at position3? 

Similarly, S at position1: we haven't tried it? 
F at position5: we haven't tried F elsewhere? Only F at1 which was wrong? 

So ""shelf"" seems a valid word? 

But note: we haven't ruled out positions? 

Now, let's see if it satisfies:

S: at position1 -> yes, which is an allowed position? (1 or 2)? 
E: at position3 -> yes, allowed (1,2,3)? 
F: at position5 -> allowed? F can be at2,3,4,5? 

Also, the letters: S, H, E, L, F? 
H and L? Not in the absent letters? 

So valid? 

But wait, does the word contain S? Yes? 
E? Yes? 
F? Yes? 

But how do we know H and L are in the word? We don't? We are testing? 

Alternatively, we can try Case 2: S at position2? 

Then: _ S _ _ _

E must be at position1,2, or3? But position2 is taken? So E cannot be at2? So E at1 or3? 

F must be somewhere? 

Subcase 2a: S at2, E at1? Then: E S _ _ _

Then we must include F? Which can be at3,4,5? 

Example: ""essay""? But A absent? 
""espry""? E-S-P-R-Y -> R absent? 
""esfly""? Not valid?

Subcase 2b: S at2, E at3? Then: _ S E _ _

Then we have F? Can be at position1,4,5? 

For F at1: F S E _ _ 
Example: ""fse"" not common? ""frees""? F-R-E-E-S? R absent and duplicate E? Not? 

Or ""flesk"" not valid? 

For F at4: _ S E F _ 
Example: ""usefu"" not valid? 
""misef"" not valid? 

But how about ""birse"" not valid? 

Try: ""hsefl"" not valid? 

Another word: ""sheaf""? S H E A F? But A absent? 

""sheaf"" is S at position2? H at1? E at3? A at4? F at5? But A absent? 

""shift""? S-H-I-F-T? I and T absent? 

""spill""? but P? and L? S-P-I-L-L? I absent? 

""skill""? S-K-I-L-L? I absent? 

Not working?

Alternatively, with F at5: _ S E _ F 
Example: ""usekf"" not valid? 
""sease"" not valid? 

Perhaps ""casef"" not valid? 

But ""cosec"" not valid? 

Maybe we consider ""beset""? B-E-S-E-T? But duplicate E? And T absent? 

Another: ""wised"" -> W-I-S-E-D? I absent? 

""leses"" -> duplicate E? and L? 

Not good.

So ""shelf"" seems a strong candidate? 

Alternatively, is there another word? 

In Case 1 with S at1 and E at3? We had ""shelf"" which is good? 

Another possibility: S at position5? But we ruled out because from ""fumes"", S at5 got '-'? So S cannot be at5? Therefore, S must be at1 or2? 

We have to use F? 

Another word for S at1, E at3? 

""speak""? But P? But also A absent? And we don't need F? But we must use F? 

Another: ""scref"" not valid? 

Or ""scylf"" not valid? 

Therefore, ""shelf"" is a valid English word? 

And fits all constraints? 

So we can guess ""shelf""? 

But let me confirm the positions: 
Position1: S -> allowed? S can be at1? 
Position2: H? 
Position3: E -> allowed? because E can be at1,2, or3? 
Position4: L? 
Position5: F? 

For F: we know F is in the word and cannot be at position1? In ""shelf"", F is at position5? Which is allowed? 

We haven't tested F at position5? 

S at position1: we haven't tested? 

E at position3: we haven't tested? 

So we can try? 

But note: in previous guesses, we have S and E marked. 

So we try ""shelf""? 

But what about the new letters? H and L? 

They are not in the absent list? 

So we agree? 

But wait, is there a word like ""self"" something? But we need 5-letters? 

""selfs"" has duplicate S? 

So ""shelf"" is a word? And in the dictionary? 

Yes? 

Alternative: ""scaff"" not valid? 

So we'll guess ""shelf"". 

But in feedback of guess3, we have F(-) meaning F is present but not at1? And in ""shelf"", F is at5? That's fine? 

Also, E(-) in guess3? Because E was at4? Now we put E at3? 

And S(-) in guess3? Because S was at5? Now we put S at1? 

And the other letters: H and L? 

So we'll do:

<guess>shelf</guess> 

Response: 

After analyzing feedback:
- Present letters: S, E, F.
- Position constraints: 
  - S must be at 1 or 2 (excluded from positions 3,4,5).
  - E must be at 1, 2, or 3 (excluded from 4,5).
  - F must be not at 1 (can be at 2,3,4,5).
- Words like ""shelf"" (S at 1, E at 3, F at 5) fit constraints.
- Tests new letters: H, L.

<guess>shelf</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I absent.  
  - S present, but not in position 4.  
  - E present, but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""onset""**  
  Feedback: O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O, N, T absent.  
  - S present, but not in position 3.  
  - E present, but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 3: ""fumes""**  
  Feedback: F(-), U(x), M(x), E(-), S(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - F present, but not in position 1.  
  - U, M absent.  
  - E present, but not in position 4 (reconfirmed).  
  - S present, but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Present Letters**: S, E, F.  
2. **Confirmed Absent Letters**: R, A, I, O, N, T, U, M (8 total).  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 (from ""onset""), 4 (from ""raise""), or 5 (from ""fumes""). Only positions 1 or 2 possible.  
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Only positions 1, 2, or 3 possible.  
   - **F**: Cannot be in position 1 (from ""fumes""). Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 allowed.  
4. **Unknown Letters**: 2 letters remaining. Since the secret word is 5 letters, and S/E/F are confirmed, the missing letters must be chosen from unused letters (B, C, D, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Prioritize Testing Positions**: Place S in an untried position (1 or 2) and E in an untried position (1, 2, or 3). Avoid F in position 1.  
- **Maximize Information**: Use common consonants (e.g., H, L) to cover new ground.  
- **Valid Words Considered**:  
  - Option: ""shelf"" (S-H-E-L-F)  
    - S at position 1 (allowed).  
    - E at position 3 (allowed).  
    - F at position 5 (allowed, avoids position 1).  
    - Tests new letters H and L.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  

### Why ""shelf""?
- Tests S at position 1 (untried), E at position 3 (untried), and F at position 5 (untried since F was only tested at position 1).  
- Covers new common consonants (H, L).  
- Fits all constraints and is a valid English word (meaning: a ledge or storage area).  

<guess>shelf</guess>",shelf,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: raise -> R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)
Meaning: 
  - R, A, I are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""raise"").
  - E is in the word but not in position 5 (where it was in ""raise"").

Guess 2: onset -> O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)
Meaning:
  - O, N, T are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was in ""onset"").
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""onset"").

Guess 3: fumes -> F(-), U(x), M(x), E(-), S(-)
Meaning:
  - F is in the word but not in position 1 (since ""fumes"" had F at 1 and got '-'). 
  - U is not in the word (x).
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since ""fumes"" had E at position 4? Wait, let me check: ""fumes"" is F-U-M-E-S, so E is at position 4? But the feedback is E(-), meaning E is in the word but not at position 4).
  - S is in the word but not in position 5 (since ""fumes"" had S at position 5 and got '-', meaning not at position 5).

Now, summing up:

Known absent letters: R, A, I, O, N, T, U, M (from the x's: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M)

Present letters (but position not fully known): 
1. S (seen in every guess, and we know: not at 3,4,5? Wait, from each guess we have restrictions)
   - From guess1: not at pos4.
   - From guess2: not at pos3.
   - From guess3: not at pos5.
   And also, we haven't tried S at pos1 or pos2? But note: we tried in ""onset"" at pos3 and ""fumes"" at pos5? And ""raise"" at pos4? So we have tried positions 3,4,5? But not 1 or 2? 

   Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 2? But wait, we are going to have to try everywhere? Actually, only positions 1 and 2 are left for S? Because we have excluded positions 3,4,5? 

   Similarly for E:
   - From guess1: not at pos5.
   - From guess2: not at pos4.
   - From guess3: not at pos4 (again)? Wait, in ""fumes"", E was at position4? So we get E(-) meaning not at position4? And we already knew that? 

   Also, we tried E at:
   - Guess1: pos5? (in ""raise"", E at pos5, but got '-')
   - Guess2: in ""onset"", E at pos4? got '-'.
   - Guess3: in ""fumes"", E at position4? again? Same as guess2? That's redundant? But the feedback also says E(-) for guess3? So we confirm E not at pos4? 

   Also, we have tried E in position 5 (guess1) and position4 (guess2 and guess3). So we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? 

   But note: in ""fumes"", E was at position4? But we have excluded position4? So E must be in position 1,2, or 3? 

   Now, we also have a new present letter: F. 
   From guess3: F is in the word but not at position1 (because in ""fumes"" it was at1 and got '-').

So we have three present letters: S, E, F? 
And the word has 5 letters? So there are two more? 

But wait: we have three present letters: S, E, F? And two more unknown? 

Now, absent letters: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M (8 letters).

So remaining letters are: B,C,D,G,H,K,L,P,V,W,Y, and perhaps others? 

Now, let's summarize position constraints:

For S: 
  - Cannot be at pos3 (from guess2), pos4 (guess1), pos5 (guess3). 
  - So must be at position 1 or 2.

For E:
  - Cannot be at pos4 (guess2 and guess3 confirmed) and pos5 (guess1).
  - So must be at position 1,2, or 3.

For F:
  - Cannot be at position1 (guess3) -> so must be at position 2,3,4, or5? 

But we know the secret word has S, E, F? And we need to assign positions.

Also, we have not placed the other two letters? 

We have used 8 absent letters? And 3 present? So we have 15 letters left? (26-11=15) but we don't care? 

Now, we must form a word that:

- Contains S, E, F? 
- Does not contain R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M?
- Placed such that:
   - S: at position 1 or 2? 
   - E: at position 1,2,3? (but note, we cannot have two letters at the same position? So if S is at1, then E cannot be at1? And vice versa? 

Similarly, F should be placed in positions 2,3,4,5? But we might assign based on the constraints? 

We must form a valid English word.

Let me list the possible patterns:

Case 1: S at position1? 
Then the word: S _ _ _ _

Since E must be at1,2, or3? But position1 is taken by S? So E must be at2 or3? 

And F must be at2,3,4,5? But positions 2 and 3 are possible? 

So two subcases:

Subcase 1a: S at1, E at2? Then: S E _ _ _

We must have F somewhere? But if E is at2, then F cannot be at2? So F can be at3,4,5? 

Now, we have positions 3,4,5 to fill: one of them with F? And the other two with new letters? 

But the word must be valid.

Examples: ""seefy""? Not valid.
""sefka""? Not valid.
""sefly""? Not valid.

Possible words? 

""sebum""? But U present? But U is absent? We know U is absent from ""fumes"" -> U(x). 

So no U? 

""sebum"" has U? Absent.

""sedgy""? S-E-D-G-Y -> D, G, Y? 
Is it a word? Yes? 

But then we must have F? But there is no F? 

This pattern doesn't have F? But we must include F? 

The secret word contains F? So we must have F in the word? 

Therefore, S at1 and E at2: then we must include F in the remaining three? 

For example, ""selfy""? Not a word.
""seffa"" not valid?
""shelf"" -> but that's 5 letters? S-H-E-L-F? Then positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:F? 
But we are putting E at3? But we are talking about E at2? 

If S at1 and E at2? Then we cannot have E at3? 

So for ""shelf"": it would have E at3? But we want E at2? 

What about ""seism""? S-E-I-S-M -> I is absent? And duplicate S? 

Not possible.

What about ""sefer""? S-E-F-E-R? But duplicate E and R absent? Not valid.

So few words with S at1 and E at2 that also include F? 

""serf"" -> only 4 letters? 

""serfs"" -> duplicate S? And R absent? 

No.

Alternative: S at1, E at3? Then: S _ E _ _

Then F can be at2? Or at4? Or5? 

But if F is at2: S F E _ _ 
Then we need to fill? ""sfere""? Not common? 
""sfree""? Not valid.

If F at4: S _ E F _
Then example: ""sdeff"" not valid.
""sheff"" not valid? 
Try: ""shelf"" but then E at3? And F at5? 

S _ E F _ 

Then ""shelf"": S-H-E-L-F -> but that is S at1, H at2, E at3, L at4, F at5? 

Then we have S at1? E at3? F at5? 

But E is at3? Allowed? And F is at5? Allowed? 

But we must use two new letters? H and L? 

And the word exists: ""shelf"" meaning a ledge? 

But is it a word? Yes.

But we have to check: letters: S, H, E, L, F -> no absent letters? (absent: R,A,I,O,N,T,U,M? So H,L are fine? )

Yes, H and L are not absent? They haven't been tried? 

Also, E is at position3? Previously, we tried positions: 
- raise: E at5? 
- onset: E at4? 
- fumes: E at4? 

So we haven't tried E at position3? 

Similarly, S at position1: we haven't tried it? 
F at position5: we haven't tried F elsewhere? Only F at1 which was wrong? 

So ""shelf"" seems a valid word? 

But note: we haven't ruled out positions? 

Now, let's see if it satisfies:

S: at position1 -> yes, which is an allowed position? (1 or 2)? 
E: at position3 -> yes, allowed (1,2,3)? 
F: at position5 -> allowed? F can be at2,3,4,5? 

Also, the letters: S, H, E, L, F? 
H and L? Not in the absent letters? 

So valid? 

But wait, does the word contain S? Yes? 
E? Yes? 
F? Yes? 

But how do we know H and L are in the word? We don't? We are testing? 

Alternatively, we can try Case 2: S at position2? 

Then: _ S _ _ _

E must be at position1,2, or3? But position2 is taken? So E cannot be at2? So E at1 or3? 

F must be somewhere? 

Subcase 2a: S at2, E at1? Then: E S _ _ _

Then we must include F? Which can be at3,4,5? 

Example: ""essay""? But A absent? 
""espry""? E-S-P-R-Y -> R absent? 
""esfly""? Not valid?

Subcase 2b: S at2, E at3? Then: _ S E _ _

Then we have F? Can be at position1,4,5? 

For F at1: F S E _ _ 
Example: ""fse"" not common? ""frees""? F-R-E-E-S? R absent and duplicate E? Not? 

Or ""flesk"" not valid? 

For F at4: _ S E F _ 
Example: ""usefu"" not valid? 
""misef"" not valid? 

But how about ""birse"" not valid? 

Try: ""hsefl"" not valid? 

Another word: ""sheaf""? S H E A F? But A absent? 

""sheaf"" is S at position2? H at1? E at3? A at4? F at5? But A absent? 

""shift""? S-H-I-F-T? I and T absent? 

""spill""? but P? and L? S-P-I-L-L? I absent? 

""skill""? S-K-I-L-L? I absent? 

Not working?

Alternatively, with F at5: _ S E _ F 
Example: ""usekf"" not valid? 
""sease"" not valid? 

Perhaps ""casef"" not valid? 

But ""cosec"" not valid? 

Maybe we consider ""beset""? B-E-S-E-T? But duplicate E? And T absent? 

Another: ""wised"" -> W-I-S-E-D? I absent? 

""leses"" -> duplicate E? and L? 

Not good.

So ""shelf"" seems a strong candidate? 

Alternatively, is there another word? 

In Case 1 with S at1 and E at3? We had ""shelf"" which is good? 

Another possibility: S at position5? But we ruled out because from ""fumes"", S at5 got '-'? So S cannot be at5? Therefore, S must be at1 or2? 

We have to use F? 

Another word for S at1, E at3? 

""speak""? But P? But also A absent? And we don't need F? But we must use F? 

Another: ""scref"" not valid? 

Or ""scylf"" not valid? 

Therefore, ""shelf"" is a valid English word? 

And fits all constraints? 

So we can guess ""shelf""? 

But let me confirm the positions: 
Position1: S -> allowed? S can be at1? 
Position2: H? 
Position3: E -> allowed? because E can be at1,2, or3? 
Position4: L? 
Position5: F? 

For F: we know F is in the word and cannot be at position1? In ""shelf"", F is at position5? Which is allowed? 

We haven't tested F at position5? 

S at position1: we haven't tested? 

E at position3: we haven't tested? 

So we can try? 

But note: in previous guesses, we have S and E marked. 

So we try ""shelf""? 

But what about the new letters? H and L? 

They are not in the absent list? 

So we agree? 

But wait, is there a word like ""self"" something? But we need 5-letters? 

""selfs"" has duplicate S? 

So ""shelf"" is a word? And in the dictionary? 

Yes? 

Alternative: ""scaff"" not valid? 

So we'll guess ""shelf"". 

But in feedback of guess3, we have F(-) meaning F is present but not at1? And in ""shelf"", F is at5? That's fine? 

Also, E(-) in guess3? Because E was at4? Now we put E at3? 

And S(-) in guess3? Because S was at5? Now we put S at1? 

And the other letters: H and L? 

So we'll do:

<guess>shelf</guess> 

Response: 

After analyzing feedback:
- Present letters: S, E, F.
- Position constraints: 
  - S must be at 1 or 2 (excluded from positions 3,4,5).
  - E must be at 1, 2, or 3 (excluded from 4,5).
  - F must be not at 1 (can be at 2,3,4,5).
- Words like ""shelf"" (S at 1, E at 3, F at 5) fit constraints.
- Tests new letters: H, L.

<guess>shelf</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(-), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I absent.  
  - S present, but not in position 4.  
  - E present, but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""onset""**  
  Feedback: O(x), N(x), S(-), E(-), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - O, N, T absent.  
  - S present, but not in position 3.  
  - E present, but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 3: ""fumes""**  
  Feedback: F(-), U(x), M(x), E(-), S(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - F present, but not in position 1.  
  - U, M absent.  
  - E present, but not in position 4 (reconfirmed).  
  - S present, but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Confirmed Present Letters**: S, E, F.  
2. **Confirmed Absent Letters**: R, A, I, O, N, T, U, M (8 total).  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - **S**: Cannot be in positions 3 (from ""onset""), 4 (from ""raise""), or 5 (from ""fumes""). Only positions 1 or 2 possible.  
   - **E**: Cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Only positions 1, 2, or 3 possible.  
   - **F**: Cannot be in position 1 (from ""fumes""). Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 allowed.  
4. **Unknown Letters**: 2 letters remaining. Since the secret word is 5 letters, and S/E/F are confirmed, the missing letters must be chosen from unused letters (B, C, D, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Prioritize Testing Positions**: Place S in an untried position (1 or 2) and E in an untried position (1, 2, or 3). Avoid F in position 1.  
- **Maximize Information**: Use common consonants (e.g., H, L) to cover new ground.  
- **Valid Words Considered**:  
  - Option: ""shelf"" (S-H-E-L-F)  
    - S at position 1 (allowed).  
    - E at position 3 (allowed).  
    - F at position 5 (allowed, avoids position 1).  
    - Tests new letters H and L.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  

### Why ""shelf""?
- Tests S at position 1 (untried), E at position 3 (untried), and F at position 5 (untried since F was only tested at position 1).  
- Covers new common consonants (H, L).  
- Fits all constraints and is a valid English word (meaning: a ledge or storage area).",Guess 4: shelf -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) E(✓) L(✓) F(✓),SUCCESS
