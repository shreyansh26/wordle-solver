We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that incorporates the known information.

 We know:
 - The word must have the letter A, but not in position 2 (index 1).
 - We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A in a position other than the second.
 2. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also note that the first guess had A in position 2, so we should try A in a different position: either 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know if A can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try to place A in a new position and use other common letters.

 Since we have no other information, a good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and uses new common letters.

 Let me consider the word ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has multiple A's. Also, we want to use distinct letters to cover more ground? But it's okay to repeat if necessary, but for guessing, distinct letters might be better.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words with A in position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but E and R are not allowed.

 We cannot use R and E. So:

 Possible words: 
   A in position 1: e.g., ""ALBUM"", ""AUDIO"", ""AISLE"" (but E is not allowed), ""ALOFT"", ""ADOPT"", ""ADULT"", ""AGLOW"", etc.

 But we also want to use common letters. Let's try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, and we have to avoid C, R, N, E, we can try:

   Position 1: A? But we don't know. We can try A in position 1, but we also have the option to try A in other positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in position 1 for now and try it in position 3 or 4.

 Let me try to choose a word that has A in position 3: for example, ""PLAIT"", but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, we can use that.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, N, E). So that's okay.

 However, we might also consider a word that has A in a different position and uses more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PASTA"" but S and T are common. But note: we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But let's break down:

   ""PASTA"": 
     P: not forbidden
     A: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 and 5? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2, so if we put A in position 2 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot put A in position 2. So ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are repeating the same mistake. We should avoid that.

 So let's choose a word without A in position 2.

 How about ""PAINT""? But N is forbidden (we had N in ""crane"" and it was x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""LIGHT""? But that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words with A in position 1: 
   ""ALIKE"" -> but E is forbidden -> no.
   ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, then L, O, F, T. None of these are forbidden (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another: ""ADOPT"": A, D, O, P, T -> no forbidden letters.

 But which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, D, etc.

 ""ALOFT"" uses A, L, O, F, T.
 ""ADOPT"" uses A, D, O, P, T.

 Both are valid. But note: we don't know if the word has F or D. We might prefer more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 3: 
   ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> common letters: P, L, T, I, and A.

 Or ""STAMP"": but S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in position 3? Actually, ""STAMP"": S (position1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). And we avoid E, and no R, N, C. But note: we have A in position 3, which is new.

 However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 But we know A is not in position 2, so we are safe to use A in positions 1,3,4,5.

 Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in position 4? 
   S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5). This uses common letters and A in a new position (4).

 But we don't know if the word has S, P, L, T.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and also includes S and T, which are common.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" as it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T. But F is less common. 

 Another word: ""ABOUT"" -> but B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B and U. And we avoid R, N, E, C. But U is a vowel, but not as common.

 How about ""AISLE""? -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. This uses vowels and D. But we don't know if the word has U, D, I, O.

 However, ""AUDIO"" is a good word for getting vowels, but we already know A is in the word, and we are avoiding E. We also know that the word doesn't have R, so we are safe.

 But we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 After considering, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it has A in position 3 (a new position) and uses common letters P, L, I, T.

 But note: we have not used S yet, which is a very common letter.

 How about ""PASTY""? But Y is less common. And we have A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2. So no.

 Another idea: ""STOMP"" -> but no A. We must include A.

 So let's go with a word that has A in position 1 and includes S and T: 
   ""ASTIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so no.
   ""ASTER"" -> E and R forbidden.

 How about ""ASHES"" -> E and S repeated? And E is forbidden.

 How about ""ASSET"" -> E is forbidden? No, because we have E in the last position? But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 So without E, what about ""ASSAM""? But that has two A's and two S's? And M? But we don't know.

 Another: ""ATOMS"": A in position 1, then T, O, M, S. This uses A in position 1 and T, O, M, S. All are new and common.

 So ""ATOMS"": 
   A (position1) -> we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing A in position1.
   T (position2)
   O (position3)
   M (position4)
   S (position5)

 This word: 
   - Includes A (which we know is in the word) in a new position (1).
   - Uses common letters: T, O, M, S.
   - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So I think ""ATOMS"" is a good second guess.

 Alternatively, we can use ""ALOFT"" or ""ADOPT"", but ""ATOMS"" has S which is very common.

 Let me choose ""ATOMS"".

 So the second guess: ""ATOMS""

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: we are not sure if A is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or nothing? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, we should get a dash for A.

 So let's go with ""ATOMS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes A (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoids position 2.
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""atoms"" because:
- A is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces common letters: T, O, M, S.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It avoids forbidden letters and position 2 for A.

 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that incorporates the known information.

 We know:
 - The word must have the letter A, but not in position 2 (index 1).
 - We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A in a position other than the second.
 2. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also note that the first guess had A in position 2, so we should try A in a different position: either 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know if A can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try to place A in a new position and use other common letters.

 Since we have no other information, a good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and uses new common letters.

 Let me consider the word ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has multiple A's. Also, we want to use distinct letters to cover more ground? But it's okay to repeat if necessary, but for guessing, distinct letters might be better.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words with A in position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but E and R are not allowed.

 We cannot use R and E. So:

 Possible words: 
   A in position 1: e.g., ""ALBUM"", ""AUDIO"", ""AISLE"" (but E is not allowed), ""ALOFT"", ""ADOPT"", ""ADULT"", ""AGLOW"", etc.

 But we also want to use common letters. Let's try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, and we have to avoid C, R, N, E, we can try:

   Position 1: A? But we don't know. We can try A in position 1, but we also have the option to try A in other positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in position 1 for now and try it in position 3 or 4.

 Let me try to choose a word that has A in position 3: for example, ""PLAIT"", but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, we can use that.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, N, E). So that's okay.

 However, we might also consider a word that has A in a different position and uses more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PASTA"" but S and T are common. But note: we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But let's break down:

   ""PASTA"": 
     P: not forbidden
     A: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 and 5? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2, so if we put A in position 2 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot put A in position 2. So ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are repeating the same mistake. We should avoid that.

 So let's choose a word without A in position 2.

 How about ""PAINT""? But N is forbidden (we had N in ""crane"" and it was x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""LIGHT""? But that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words with A in position 1: 
   ""ALIKE"" -> but E is forbidden -> no.
   ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, then L, O, F, T. None of these are forbidden (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another: ""ADOPT"": A, D, O, P, T -> no forbidden letters.

 But which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, D, etc.

 ""ALOFT"" uses A, L, O, F, T.
 ""ADOPT"" uses A, D, O, P, T.

 Both are valid. But note: we don't know if the word has F or D. We might prefer more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 3: 
   ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> common letters: P, L, T, I, and A.

 Or ""STAMP"": but S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in position 3? Actually, ""STAMP"": S (position1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). And we avoid E, and no R, N, C. But note: we have A in position 3, which is new.

 However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 But we know A is not in position 2, so we are safe to use A in positions 1,3,4,5.

 Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in position 4? 
   S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5). This uses common letters and A in a new position (4).

 But we don't know if the word has S, P, L, T.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and also includes S and T, which are common.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" as it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T. But F is less common. 

 Another word: ""ABOUT"" -> but B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B and U. And we avoid R, N, E, C. But U is a vowel, but not as common.

 How about ""AISLE""? -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. This uses vowels and D. But we don't know if the word has U, D, I, O.

 However, ""AUDIO"" is a good word for getting vowels, but we already know A is in the word, and we are avoiding E. We also know that the word doesn't have R, so we are safe.

 But we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 After considering, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it has A in position 3 (a new position) and uses common letters P, L, I, T.

 But note: we have not used S yet, which is a very common letter.

 How about ""PASTY""? But Y is less common. And we have A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2. So no.

 Another idea: ""STOMP"" -> but no A. We must include A.

 So let's go with a word that has A in position 1 and includes S and T: 
   ""ASTIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so no.
   ""ASTER"" -> E and R forbidden.

 How about ""ASHES"" -> E and S repeated? And E is forbidden.

 How about ""ASSET"" -> E is forbidden? No, because we have E in the last position? But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 So without E, what about ""ASSAM""? But that has two A's and two S's? And M? But we don't know.

 Another: ""ATOMS"": A in position 1, then T, O, M, S. This uses A in position 1 and T, O, M, S. All are new and common.

 So ""ATOMS"": 
   A (position1) -> we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing A in position1.
   T (position2)
   O (position3)
   M (position4)
   S (position5)

 This word: 
   - Includes A (which we know is in the word) in a new position (1).
   - Uses common letters: T, O, M, S.
   - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So I think ""ATOMS"" is a good second guess.

 Alternatively, we can use ""ALOFT"" or ""ADOPT"", but ""ATOMS"" has S which is very common.

 Let me choose ""ATOMS"".

 So the second guess: ""ATOMS""

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: we are not sure if A is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or nothing? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, we should get a dash for A.

 So let's go with ""ATOMS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes A (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoids position 2.
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""atoms"" because:
- A is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces common letters: T, O, M, S.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It avoids forbidden letters and position 2 for A.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is in the word, but not at position 2)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""atoms""
  A: ✓ (correct, so A is in the word and in position 1)
  T: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  M: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:

- The secret word has A in the first position. (Because we got a check for A in position 1 in ""atoms"".)
- The secret word contains O and M, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, from the first guess, we already knew A is in the word (and now we know it's at position 1) and that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we know the first letter is A.

We also know that O and M are in the word, but we don't know their positions. We must avoid positions 3 for O and 4 for M? Actually, the feedback for O is that it is in the word but not at position 3, and for M, not at position 4.

Additionally, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.

So, the available letters are: A (fixed at position 1), O, M, and then we need two more letters. We don't know what they are, so we have to guess.

We have 4 more guesses left (since we used 2).

Now, we can think of words that start with A, have O and M (but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively), and do not contain C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, we don't know the positions of O and M. They can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints: O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback) and M cannot be at position 4.

But note: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, so O is in the word but not at 3. Similarly, M was at position 4 and marked wrong position, so M is in the word but not at 4.

Now, the word structure:

Position 1: A (fixed)

We need to place O and M in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:
- O cannot be at position 3.
- M cannot be at position 4.

Also, we have two more letters to fill, which are unknown.

We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet. The letters we haven't tried are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: like L, I, P, U, D, etc.

We also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters, starting with A, and containing O and M.

So, let's think of words that start with A, have O and M, and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words:

- ALO?M? -> but we have to avoid S, T, etc.

For example:
- ALOUD: but D is allowed? Yes, but we have O and U and D. But we don't have M? So no.
- AMMON: but M repeated? And N is forbidden. Also, we don't have O? Wait, AMMON has two M's and O? Actually, AMMON is not a word? Let me think of valid words.

Actually, we need words that have exactly the letters: A, O, M, and two others.

Common words:
- ALOHA: but H is allowed? But we don't have M. So no.
- ATOLL: but T and L? T is forbidden (from guess2: T is x). So no.
- AXIOM: but X and I? And we have O and M. But we also have I. And X is allowed? But let's check: A, X, I, O, M. But we have two vowels? And we know the word has A, O, M, so that's three, plus X and I. But is ""axiom"" a word? Yes. But we have to check the positions.

But note: we have to avoid T and S, which we are. Also, we haven't used X and I.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 (which was wrong) and M at position 4 (wrong). So in ""axiom"", we would have:
  A at 1 (correct, we know)
  X at 2
  I at 3
  O at 4
  M at 5

But we know O cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""axiom"", O is at position 4, which is allowed (since the feedback only said O is not at 3, but it can be at 4). Similarly, M is at position 5, which is allowed (since M cannot be at 4, but 5 is fine).

So ""axiom"" is a candidate.

But we don't know if X and I are in the word. We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M in different positions to test more possibilities.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

Another candidate: ""ALBUM"" -> A, L, B, U, M. This has M at the end, which is position 5. And O? We don't have O. But we know O is in the word, so we must include O. So ""album"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the word.

We must include O and M.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has O at the end, but no M. So no.

""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. This has M at position 2? But we don't have O. So no.

We need a word that has both O and M.

Let me list words: 
- AMMONIA -> too long, we need 5 letters.
- AXIOM: as above.
- AROMAS: but S is forbidden and we have two A's? But we know A is at position 1, so if we put A at position 1 and then another A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is forbidden. So no.
- ALOFT: we tried in the previous step? But we didn't use it. But in ""atoms"" we have T and S as not in the word, and T is in ""aloft"", so we cannot use ""aloft"" because T is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has T, forbidden.

So back to ""axiom"": A, X, I, O, M.

But X and I are not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""ABHOM"" -> not a word.

""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O. This has M at position 2 and O at position 5. But we have to check the positions: 
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> but we don't know if M can be at 2? The feedback only said M is not at 4, so it can be at 2.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

But we also have O at position 5, which is allowed (since we only know O is not at 3).

So ""amigo"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""AMINO"": but N is forbidden, so no.

""AMPLY"": no O.

""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D. This has O at position 3? But we know O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback). So if we put O at 3, it would be wrong. But we are trying to avoid that. So we cannot put O at 3.

In ""avoid"", O is at position 3, which is the forbidden position for O? So we should avoid that because we know it's not there.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"": O at position 3? Also forbidden.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3.

In ""amigo"", O is at 5, which is fine.

Another candidate: ""ALOHA"" -> no M.

""MAYOR"": but M is at position 1? But we need A at position 1. So no.

We need A at 1.

So let's consider ""amigo"" and ""axiom"".

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M and uses common letters we haven't tried, like L, I, P, U, etc.

But in ""amigo"", we have I and G.

In ""axiom"", we have X and I.

X is less common, so maybe ""amigo"" is better.

But let's see: we know the word has M, and in ""amigo"", M is at position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not.

Similarly, in ""axiom"", M is at position 5.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> no M.

""AMASS"" -> S is forbidden and no O.

""AMONG"": A, M, O, N, G. But N is forbidden (from guess1: N is x). So no.

""AMOUR"": A, M, O, U, R. But R is forbidden (from guess1: R is x). So no.

""AMPLE"": E is forbidden. So no.

So the candidates are limited.

Another: ""ALBUM"" -> no O.

""ANIMI"" -> N forbidden.

""APIOL"" -> not common.

""APPLE"" -> P, P, L, E -> E forbidden.

So I think ""amigo"" and ""axiom"" are the main candidates.

But let's try to think of a word with O and M and without forbidden letters, and A at start.

""AMOWE"" -> not a word.

""AVOWE"" -> E forbidden.

""ABOMA"" -> but B, O, M, A. But we have two A's? And O and M. So ""aboma"": A, B, O, M, A. But we have A at position 1 and 5. We know A is at position 1, so if we put A at 5, it might be correct or not? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid putting O and M in forbidden positions.

In ""aboma"": 
  A at 1: correct
  B at 2
  O at 3 -> but O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O was at 3 and was wrong position). So if we put O at 3, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

So ""aboma"" is invalid because O is at 3.

Similarly, any word with O at 3 is invalid.

So we must have O at position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, M cannot be at 4, so M at 2, 3, or 5.

Now, let's list possible words:

- O at 2: then M at 3 or 5 (since M cannot be at 4, and 4 is available for other letters). But if O is at 2, then M can be at 3? But position 3 is available for M? We don't have constraint on M at 3? Only that M cannot be at 4.

For example: 
  A, O, M, ?, ? -> but then M at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for other letters.

But we need to form a word: e.g., ""AOM??"" -> not many words. ""AOMIA"" -> not a word? ""AORTA"" -> but R and T forbidden.

- O at 4: then M can be at 2, 3, or 5.

For example: 
  A, ?, ?, O, M -> e.g., ""AXIOM"" (if we put O at 4 and M at 5? In ""axiom"", it's A, X, I, O, M -> so O at 4, M at 5. That works.

- O at 5: then M can be at 2 or 3.

For example: ""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O -> O at 5, M at 2.

Or ""A??OM"": e.g., ""AUDOM"" not a word.

So the two best candidates are ""axiom"" (with O at 4 and M at 5) and ""amigo"" (with M at 2 and O at 5).

We can choose one to test.

But we also want to cover new letters. In ""amigo"", we use M, I, G, O. In ""axiom"", we use X, I, O, M.

We haven't used I, G, X.

G is more common than X, so ""amigo"" might be better? But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we can try to include L or U or other common letters.

Is there a word like ""AULOI""? Not common.

""ALOIN"" -> N forbidden.

""ALMUG"" -> not common.

""AMIGO"" seems reasonable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We know the first letter is A, so we can focus on the other positions.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""amigo"" because it uses more common letters.

So third guess: ""amigo""

But let's write it: AMIGO

We'll see if M is at 2, O at 5, and what about I and G.

But note: in ""amigo"", we have:
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> we don't know if it's correct or not. It could be correct or wrong position.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

We know O is in the word, and we are putting it at 5, which is allowed. Similarly, M is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know M is not at 4).

So we'll get feedback on M, I, G, O.

But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put M and O in positions we are unsure about, but we have to include them.

Another idea: since we know O is not at 3, and M not at 4, we can try to put O at 2 and M at 5, for example.

Is there a word: A, O, ?, ?, M

For example: ""AOXOM"" not a word.

""ABOHM"" not common.

""ADOBE"" -> E forbidden.

So not many options.

Therefore, I think ""amigo"" is a good choice.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (atoms)**: A is correct in position 1. O and M are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively. T and S are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **A**.
- It contains **O** and **M**, but:
  - O cannot be in position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
  - M cannot be in position 4 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.
- Remaining letters to consider: Common unused letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since A is fixed at position 1, focus on placing O and M in valid positions (O not at 3, M not at 4) while testing new common letters.
- Choose a word that:
  - Starts with A.
  - Includes O and M.
  - Uses new, common letters (e.g., I, G, L, P) to maximize information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and forbidden positions for O and M.

After evaluating options like ""axiom"" (less common letters) and ""amigo"" (common letters), **""amigo""** is selected because:
- It places A in position 1 (correct).
- It tests M in position 2 (allowed, since M cannot be at 4 but position 2 is new).
- It tests O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3 but position 5 is new).
- It introduces new common letters I (position 3) and G (position 4), which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, S).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of O and M and reveal if I or G are in the word.

<guess>amigo</guess>",amigo,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is in the word, but not at position 2)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""atoms""
  A: ✓ (correct, so A is in the word and in position 1)
  T: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  M: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:

- The secret word has A in the first position. (Because we got a check for A in position 1 in ""atoms"".)
- The secret word contains O and M, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, from the first guess, we already knew A is in the word (and now we know it's at position 1) and that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we know the first letter is A.

We also know that O and M are in the word, but we don't know their positions. We must avoid positions 3 for O and 4 for M? Actually, the feedback for O is that it is in the word but not at position 3, and for M, not at position 4.

Additionally, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.

So, the available letters are: A (fixed at position 1), O, M, and then we need two more letters. We don't know what they are, so we have to guess.

We have 4 more guesses left (since we used 2).

Now, we can think of words that start with A, have O and M (but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively), and do not contain C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, we don't know the positions of O and M. They can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints: O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback) and M cannot be at position 4.

But note: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, so O is in the word but not at 3. Similarly, M was at position 4 and marked wrong position, so M is in the word but not at 4.

Now, the word structure:

Position 1: A (fixed)

We need to place O and M in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:
- O cannot be at position 3.
- M cannot be at position 4.

Also, we have two more letters to fill, which are unknown.

We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet. The letters we haven't tried are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: like L, I, P, U, D, etc.

We also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters, starting with A, and containing O and M.

So, let's think of words that start with A, have O and M, and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words:

- ALO?M? -> but we have to avoid S, T, etc.

For example:
- ALOUD: but D is allowed? Yes, but we have O and U and D. But we don't have M? So no.
- AMMON: but M repeated? And N is forbidden. Also, we don't have O? Wait, AMMON has two M's and O? Actually, AMMON is not a word? Let me think of valid words.

Actually, we need words that have exactly the letters: A, O, M, and two others.

Common words:
- ALOHA: but H is allowed? But we don't have M. So no.
- ATOLL: but T and L? T is forbidden (from guess2: T is x). So no.
- AXIOM: but X and I? And we have O and M. But we also have I. And X is allowed? But let's check: A, X, I, O, M. But we have two vowels? And we know the word has A, O, M, so that's three, plus X and I. But is ""axiom"" a word? Yes. But we have to check the positions.

But note: we have to avoid T and S, which we are. Also, we haven't used X and I.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 (which was wrong) and M at position 4 (wrong). So in ""axiom"", we would have:
  A at 1 (correct, we know)
  X at 2
  I at 3
  O at 4
  M at 5

But we know O cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""axiom"", O is at position 4, which is allowed (since the feedback only said O is not at 3, but it can be at 4). Similarly, M is at position 5, which is allowed (since M cannot be at 4, but 5 is fine).

So ""axiom"" is a candidate.

But we don't know if X and I are in the word. We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M in different positions to test more possibilities.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

Another candidate: ""ALBUM"" -> A, L, B, U, M. This has M at the end, which is position 5. And O? We don't have O. But we know O is in the word, so we must include O. So ""album"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the word.

We must include O and M.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has O at the end, but no M. So no.

""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. This has M at position 2? But we don't have O. So no.

We need a word that has both O and M.

Let me list words: 
- AMMONIA -> too long, we need 5 letters.
- AXIOM: as above.
- AROMAS: but S is forbidden and we have two A's? But we know A is at position 1, so if we put A at position 1 and then another A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is forbidden. So no.
- ALOFT: we tried in the previous step? But we didn't use it. But in ""atoms"" we have T and S as not in the word, and T is in ""aloft"", so we cannot use ""aloft"" because T is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has T, forbidden.

So back to ""axiom"": A, X, I, O, M.

But X and I are not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""ABHOM"" -> not a word.

""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O. This has M at position 2 and O at position 5. But we have to check the positions: 
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> but we don't know if M can be at 2? The feedback only said M is not at 4, so it can be at 2.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

But we also have O at position 5, which is allowed (since we only know O is not at 3).

So ""amigo"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""AMINO"": but N is forbidden, so no.

""AMPLY"": no O.

""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D. This has O at position 3? But we know O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback). So if we put O at 3, it would be wrong. But we are trying to avoid that. So we cannot put O at 3.

In ""avoid"", O is at position 3, which is the forbidden position for O? So we should avoid that because we know it's not there.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"": O at position 3? Also forbidden.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3.

In ""amigo"", O is at 5, which is fine.

Another candidate: ""ALOHA"" -> no M.

""MAYOR"": but M is at position 1? But we need A at position 1. So no.

We need A at 1.

So let's consider ""amigo"" and ""axiom"".

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M and uses common letters we haven't tried, like L, I, P, U, etc.

But in ""amigo"", we have I and G.

In ""axiom"", we have X and I.

X is less common, so maybe ""amigo"" is better.

But let's see: we know the word has M, and in ""amigo"", M is at position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not.

Similarly, in ""axiom"", M is at position 5.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> no M.

""AMASS"" -> S is forbidden and no O.

""AMONG"": A, M, O, N, G. But N is forbidden (from guess1: N is x). So no.

""AMOUR"": A, M, O, U, R. But R is forbidden (from guess1: R is x). So no.

""AMPLE"": E is forbidden. So no.

So the candidates are limited.

Another: ""ALBUM"" -> no O.

""ANIMI"" -> N forbidden.

""APIOL"" -> not common.

""APPLE"" -> P, P, L, E -> E forbidden.

So I think ""amigo"" and ""axiom"" are the main candidates.

But let's try to think of a word with O and M and without forbidden letters, and A at start.

""AMOWE"" -> not a word.

""AVOWE"" -> E forbidden.

""ABOMA"" -> but B, O, M, A. But we have two A's? And O and M. So ""aboma"": A, B, O, M, A. But we have A at position 1 and 5. We know A is at position 1, so if we put A at 5, it might be correct or not? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid putting O and M in forbidden positions.

In ""aboma"": 
  A at 1: correct
  B at 2
  O at 3 -> but O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O was at 3 and was wrong position). So if we put O at 3, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

So ""aboma"" is invalid because O is at 3.

Similarly, any word with O at 3 is invalid.

So we must have O at position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, M cannot be at 4, so M at 2, 3, or 5.

Now, let's list possible words:

- O at 2: then M at 3 or 5 (since M cannot be at 4, and 4 is available for other letters). But if O is at 2, then M can be at 3? But position 3 is available for M? We don't have constraint on M at 3? Only that M cannot be at 4.

For example: 
  A, O, M, ?, ? -> but then M at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for other letters.

But we need to form a word: e.g., ""AOM??"" -> not many words. ""AOMIA"" -> not a word? ""AORTA"" -> but R and T forbidden.

- O at 4: then M can be at 2, 3, or 5.

For example: 
  A, ?, ?, O, M -> e.g., ""AXIOM"" (if we put O at 4 and M at 5? In ""axiom"", it's A, X, I, O, M -> so O at 4, M at 5. That works.

- O at 5: then M can be at 2 or 3.

For example: ""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O -> O at 5, M at 2.

Or ""A??OM"": e.g., ""AUDOM"" not a word.

So the two best candidates are ""axiom"" (with O at 4 and M at 5) and ""amigo"" (with M at 2 and O at 5).

We can choose one to test.

But we also want to cover new letters. In ""amigo"", we use M, I, G, O. In ""axiom"", we use X, I, O, M.

We haven't used I, G, X.

G is more common than X, so ""amigo"" might be better? But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we can try to include L or U or other common letters.

Is there a word like ""AULOI""? Not common.

""ALOIN"" -> N forbidden.

""ALMUG"" -> not common.

""AMIGO"" seems reasonable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We know the first letter is A, so we can focus on the other positions.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""amigo"" because it uses more common letters.

So third guess: ""amigo""

But let's write it: AMIGO

We'll see if M is at 2, O at 5, and what about I and G.

But note: in ""amigo"", we have:
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> we don't know if it's correct or not. It could be correct or wrong position.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

We know O is in the word, and we are putting it at 5, which is allowed. Similarly, M is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know M is not at 4).

So we'll get feedback on M, I, G, O.

But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put M and O in positions we are unsure about, but we have to include them.

Another idea: since we know O is not at 3, and M not at 4, we can try to put O at 2 and M at 5, for example.

Is there a word: A, O, ?, ?, M

For example: ""AOXOM"" not a word.

""ABOHM"" not common.

""ADOBE"" -> E forbidden.

So not many options.

Therefore, I think ""amigo"" is a good choice.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (atoms)**: A is correct in position 1. O and M are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively. T and S are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **A**.
- It contains **O** and **M**, but:
  - O cannot be in position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
  - M cannot be in position 4 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.
- Remaining letters to consider: Common unused letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since A is fixed at position 1, focus on placing O and M in valid positions (O not at 3, M not at 4) while testing new common letters.
- Choose a word that:
  - Starts with A.
  - Includes O and M.
  - Uses new, common letters (e.g., I, G, L, P) to maximize information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and forbidden positions for O and M.

After evaluating options like ""axiom"" (less common letters) and ""amigo"" (common letters), **""amigo""** is selected because:
- It places A in position 1 (correct).
- It tests M in position 2 (allowed, since M cannot be at 4 but position 2 is new).
- It tests O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3 but position 5 is new).
- It introduces new common letters I (position 3) and G (position 4), which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, S).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of O and M and reveal if I or G are in the word.",Guess 3: amigo -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(-) I(✓) G(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,AXIOM,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). Also, it doesn't repeat letters.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the second position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that incorporates the known information.

 We know:
 - The word must have the letter A, but not in position 2 (index 1).
 - We must avoid using C, R, N, E.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A in a position other than the second.
 2. Uses other common letters to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

 Let's think of common letters that are not C, R, N, E. Common letters in English include S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 We also note that the first guess had A in position 2, so we should try A in a different position: either 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we don't know if A can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try to place A in a new position and use other common letters.

 Since we have no other information, a good strategy is to try a word that has A in a different position and uses new common letters.

 Let me consider the word ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has multiple A's. Also, we want to use distinct letters to cover more ground? But it's okay to repeat if necessary, but for guessing, distinct letters might be better.

 However, we must avoid the letters C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words with A in position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", but E and R are not allowed.

 We cannot use R and E. So:

 Possible words: 
   A in position 1: e.g., ""ALBUM"", ""AUDIO"", ""AISLE"" (but E is not allowed), ""ALOFT"", ""ADOPT"", ""ADULT"", ""AGLOW"", etc.

 But we also want to use common letters. Let's try to use S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Another idea: since we know A is in the word, and we have to avoid C, R, N, E, we can try:

   Position 1: A? But we don't know. We can try A in position 1, but we also have the option to try A in other positions.

 Alternatively, we can avoid putting A in position 1 for now and try it in position 3 or 4.

 Let me try to choose a word that has A in position 3: for example, ""PLAIT"", but we don't know if P, L, I, T are in the word. Also, we can use that.

 But note: we have to avoid C, R, N, E. So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? Let's check: P, L, A, I, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, N, E). So that's okay.

 However, we might also consider a word that has A in a different position and uses more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PASTA"" but S and T are common. But note: we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are avoiding E, so that's okay. But let's break down:

   ""PASTA"": 
     P: not forbidden
     A: we know it's in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 and 5? We know from feedback that A is not in position 2, so if we put A in position 2 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid position 2 for A.

 Therefore, we cannot put A in position 2. So ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We know position 2 is wrong, so we are repeating the same mistake. We should avoid that.

 So let's choose a word without A in position 2.

 How about ""PAINT""? But N is forbidden (we had N in ""crane"" and it was x). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""LIGHT""? But that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words with A in position 1: 
   ""ALIKE"" -> but E is forbidden -> no.
   ""ALOFT"": A in position 1, then L, O, F, T. None of these are forbidden (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another: ""ADOPT"": A, D, O, P, T -> no forbidden letters.

 But which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, D, etc.

 ""ALOFT"" uses A, L, O, F, T.
 ""ADOPT"" uses A, D, O, P, T.

 Both are valid. But note: we don't know if the word has F or D. We might prefer more common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 3: 
   ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> common letters: P, L, T, I, and A.

 Or ""STAMP"": but S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in position 3? Actually, ""STAMP"": S (position1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). And we avoid E, and no R, N, C. But note: we have A in position 3, which is new.

 However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? But we don't have any correct position yet.

 But we know A is not in position 2, so we are safe to use A in positions 1,3,4,5.

 Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in position 4? 
   S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5). This uses common letters and A in a new position (4).

 But we don't know if the word has S, P, L, T.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and also includes S and T, which are common.

 Let me choose ""ALOFT"" as it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T. But F is less common. 

 Another word: ""ABOUT"" -> but B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B and U. And we avoid R, N, E, C. But U is a vowel, but not as common.

 How about ""AISLE""? -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. This uses vowels and D. But we don't know if the word has U, D, I, O.

 However, ""AUDIO"" is a good word for getting vowels, but we already know A is in the word, and we are avoiding E. We also know that the word doesn't have R, so we are safe.

 But we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden, so no.

 After considering, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it has A in position 3 (a new position) and uses common letters P, L, I, T.

 But note: we have not used S yet, which is a very common letter.

 How about ""PASTY""? But Y is less common. And we have A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2. So no.

 Another idea: ""STOMP"" -> but no A. We must include A.

 So let's go with a word that has A in position 1 and includes S and T: 
   ""ASTIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so no.
   ""ASTER"" -> E and R forbidden.

 How about ""ASHES"" -> E and S repeated? And E is forbidden.

 How about ""ASSET"" -> E is forbidden? No, because we have E in the last position? But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 So without E, what about ""ASSAM""? But that has two A's and two S's? And M? But we don't know.

 Another: ""ATOMS"": A in position 1, then T, O, M, S. This uses A in position 1 and T, O, M, S. All are new and common.

 So ""ATOMS"": 
   A (position1) -> we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing A in position1.
   T (position2)
   O (position3)
   M (position4)
   S (position5)

 This word: 
   - Includes A (which we know is in the word) in a new position (1).
   - Uses common letters: T, O, M, S.
   - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.

 So I think ""ATOMS"" is a good second guess.

 Alternatively, we can use ""ALOFT"" or ""ADOPT"", but ""ATOMS"" has S which is very common.

 Let me choose ""ATOMS"".

 So the second guess: ""ATOMS""

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: we are not sure if A is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or nothing? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, we should get a dash for A.

 So let's go with ""ATOMS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes A (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoids position 2.
2. Excludes C, R, N, E.
3. Uses new common letters to maximize information.

I chose ""atoms"" because:
- A is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces common letters: T, O, M, S.
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- It avoids forbidden letters and position 2 for A.

<guess>atoms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: atoms -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is in the word, but not at position 2)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""atoms""
  A: ✓ (correct, so A is in the word and in position 1)
  T: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  M: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

So, from this we know:

- The secret word has A in the first position. (Because we got a check for A in position 1 in ""atoms"".)
- The secret word contains O and M, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, from the first guess, we already knew A is in the word (and now we know it's at position 1) and that C, R, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we know the first letter is A.

We also know that O and M are in the word, but we don't know their positions. We must avoid positions 3 for O and 4 for M? Actually, the feedback for O is that it is in the word but not at position 3, and for M, not at position 4.

Additionally, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.

So, the available letters are: A (fixed at position 1), O, M, and then we need two more letters. We don't know what they are, so we have to guess.

We have 4 more guesses left (since we used 2).

Now, we can think of words that start with A, have O and M (but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively), and do not contain C, R, N, E, T, S.

Also, we don't know the positions of O and M. They can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints: O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback) and M cannot be at position 4.

But note: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, so O is in the word but not at 3. Similarly, M was at position 4 and marked wrong position, so M is in the word but not at 4.

Now, the word structure:

Position 1: A (fixed)

We need to place O and M in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:
- O cannot be at position 3.
- M cannot be at position 4.

Also, we have two more letters to fill, which are unknown.

We should try to cover common letters that we haven't tried yet. The letters we haven't tried are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common ones: like L, I, P, U, D, etc.

We also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters, starting with A, and containing O and M.

So, let's think of words that start with A, have O and M, and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words:

- ALO?M? -> but we have to avoid S, T, etc.

For example:
- ALOUD: but D is allowed? Yes, but we have O and U and D. But we don't have M? So no.
- AMMON: but M repeated? And N is forbidden. Also, we don't have O? Wait, AMMON has two M's and O? Actually, AMMON is not a word? Let me think of valid words.

Actually, we need words that have exactly the letters: A, O, M, and two others.

Common words:
- ALOHA: but H is allowed? But we don't have M. So no.
- ATOLL: but T and L? T is forbidden (from guess2: T is x). So no.
- AXIOM: but X and I? And we have O and M. But we also have I. And X is allowed? But let's check: A, X, I, O, M. But we have two vowels? And we know the word has A, O, M, so that's three, plus X and I. But is ""axiom"" a word? Yes. But we have to check the positions.

But note: we have to avoid T and S, which we are. Also, we haven't used X and I.

But let's see the feedback we got: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 (which was wrong) and M at position 4 (wrong). So in ""axiom"", we would have:
  A at 1 (correct, we know)
  X at 2
  I at 3
  O at 4
  M at 5

But we know O cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""axiom"", O is at position 4, which is allowed (since the feedback only said O is not at 3, but it can be at 4). Similarly, M is at position 5, which is allowed (since M cannot be at 4, but 5 is fine).

So ""axiom"" is a candidate.

But we don't know if X and I are in the word. We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M in different positions to test more possibilities.

But we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

Another candidate: ""ALBUM"" -> A, L, B, U, M. This has M at the end, which is position 5. And O? We don't have O. But we know O is in the word, so we must include O. So ""album"" doesn't have O, so it cannot be the word.

We must include O and M.

Another: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has O at the end, but no M. So no.

""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. This has M at position 2? But we don't have O. So no.

We need a word that has both O and M.

Let me list words: 
- AMMONIA -> too long, we need 5 letters.
- AXIOM: as above.
- AROMAS: but S is forbidden and we have two A's? But we know A is at position 1, so if we put A at position 1 and then another A? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, S is forbidden. So no.
- ALOFT: we tried in the previous step? But we didn't use it. But in ""atoms"" we have T and S as not in the word, and T is in ""aloft"", so we cannot use ""aloft"" because T is forbidden.

Similarly, ""ADOPT"" has T, forbidden.

So back to ""axiom"": A, X, I, O, M.

But X and I are not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another word: ""ABHOM"" -> not a word.

""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O. This has M at position 2 and O at position 5. But we have to check the positions: 
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> but we don't know if M can be at 2? The feedback only said M is not at 4, so it can be at 2.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

But we also have O at position 5, which is allowed (since we only know O is not at 3).

So ""amigo"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""AMINO"": but N is forbidden, so no.

""AMPLY"": no O.

""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D. This has O at position 3? But we know O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback). So if we put O at 3, it would be wrong. But we are trying to avoid that. So we cannot put O at 3.

In ""avoid"", O is at position 3, which is the forbidden position for O? So we should avoid that because we know it's not there.

Similarly, ""ABOUT"": O at position 3? Also forbidden.

So we must avoid putting O at position 3.

In ""amigo"", O is at 5, which is fine.

Another candidate: ""ALOHA"" -> no M.

""MAYOR"": but M is at position 1? But we need A at position 1. So no.

We need A at 1.

So let's consider ""amigo"" and ""axiom"".

But we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O and M and uses common letters we haven't tried, like L, I, P, U, etc.

But in ""amigo"", we have I and G.

In ""axiom"", we have X and I.

X is less common, so maybe ""amigo"" is better.

But let's see: we know the word has M, and in ""amigo"", M is at position 2. We don't know if that's correct or not.

Similarly, in ""axiom"", M is at position 5.

We also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> no M.

""AMASS"" -> S is forbidden and no O.

""AMONG"": A, M, O, N, G. But N is forbidden (from guess1: N is x). So no.

""AMOUR"": A, M, O, U, R. But R is forbidden (from guess1: R is x). So no.

""AMPLE"": E is forbidden. So no.

So the candidates are limited.

Another: ""ALBUM"" -> no O.

""ANIMI"" -> N forbidden.

""APIOL"" -> not common.

""APPLE"" -> P, P, L, E -> E forbidden.

So I think ""amigo"" and ""axiom"" are the main candidates.

But let's try to think of a word with O and M and without forbidden letters, and A at start.

""AMOWE"" -> not a word.

""AVOWE"" -> E forbidden.

""ABOMA"" -> but B, O, M, A. But we have two A's? And O and M. So ""aboma"": A, B, O, M, A. But we have A at position 1 and 5. We know A is at position 1, so if we put A at 5, it might be correct or not? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid putting O and M in forbidden positions.

In ""aboma"": 
  A at 1: correct
  B at 2
  O at 3 -> but O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O was at 3 and was wrong position). So if we put O at 3, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

So ""aboma"" is invalid because O is at 3.

Similarly, any word with O at 3 is invalid.

So we must have O at position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, M cannot be at 4, so M at 2, 3, or 5.

Now, let's list possible words:

- O at 2: then M at 3 or 5 (since M cannot be at 4, and 4 is available for other letters). But if O is at 2, then M can be at 3? But position 3 is available for M? We don't have constraint on M at 3? Only that M cannot be at 4.

For example: 
  A, O, M, ?, ? -> but then M at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for other letters.

But we need to form a word: e.g., ""AOM??"" -> not many words. ""AOMIA"" -> not a word? ""AORTA"" -> but R and T forbidden.

- O at 4: then M can be at 2, 3, or 5.

For example: 
  A, ?, ?, O, M -> e.g., ""AXIOM"" (if we put O at 4 and M at 5? In ""axiom"", it's A, X, I, O, M -> so O at 4, M at 5. That works.

- O at 5: then M can be at 2 or 3.

For example: ""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O -> O at 5, M at 2.

Or ""A??OM"": e.g., ""AUDOM"" not a word.

So the two best candidates are ""axiom"" (with O at 4 and M at 5) and ""amigo"" (with M at 2 and O at 5).

We can choose one to test.

But we also want to cover new letters. In ""amigo"", we use M, I, G, O. In ""axiom"", we use X, I, O, M.

We haven't used I, G, X.

G is more common than X, so ""amigo"" might be better? But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we can try to include L or U or other common letters.

Is there a word like ""AULOI""? Not common.

""ALOIN"" -> N forbidden.

""ALMUG"" -> not common.

""AMIGO"" seems reasonable.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

We know the first letter is A, so we can focus on the other positions.

We have to guess: I'll go with ""amigo"" because it uses more common letters.

So third guess: ""amigo""

But let's write it: AMIGO

We'll see if M is at 2, O at 5, and what about I and G.

But note: in ""amigo"", we have:
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: M -> we don't know if it's correct or not. It could be correct or wrong position.
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: G
  Position 5: O

We know O is in the word, and we are putting it at 5, which is allowed. Similarly, M is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know M is not at 4).

So we'll get feedback on M, I, G, O.

But we are not sure.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put M and O in positions we are unsure about, but we have to include them.

Another idea: since we know O is not at 3, and M not at 4, we can try to put O at 2 and M at 5, for example.

Is there a word: A, O, ?, ?, M

For example: ""AOXOM"" not a word.

""ABOHM"" not common.

""ADOBE"" -> E forbidden.

So not many options.

Therefore, I think ""amigo"" is a good choice.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2 (atoms)**: A is correct in position 1. O and M are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively. T and S are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **A**.
- It contains **O** and **M**, but:
  - O cannot be in position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
  - M cannot be in position 4 (from ""atoms"" feedback).
- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.
- Remaining letters to consider: Common unused letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Since A is fixed at position 1, focus on placing O and M in valid positions (O not at 3, M not at 4) while testing new common letters.
- Choose a word that:
  - Starts with A.
  - Includes O and M.
  - Uses new, common letters (e.g., I, G, L, P) to maximize information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and forbidden positions for O and M.

After evaluating options like ""axiom"" (less common letters) and ""amigo"" (common letters), **""amigo""** is selected because:
- It places A in position 1 (correct).
- It tests M in position 2 (allowed, since M cannot be at 4 but position 2 is new).
- It tests O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3 but position 5 is new).
- It introduces new common letters I (position 3) and G (position 4), which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, S).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of O and M and reveal if I or G are in the word.

None of these are forbidden (C, R, N, E). So that\'s a candidate.\n\n Another: ""ADOPT"": A, D, O, P, T -> no forbidden letters.\n\n But which one to choose? We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, P, D, etc.\n\n ""ALOFT"" uses A, L, O, F, T.\n ""ADOPT"" uses A, D, O, P, T.\n\n Both are valid. But note: we don\'t know if the word has F or D. We might prefer more common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 3: \n   ""PLAIT"": P, L, A, I, T -> common letters: P, L, T, I, and A.\n\n Or ""STAMP"": but S, T, A, M, P -> but A is in position 3? Actually, ""STAMP"": S (position1), T(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). And we avoid E, and no R, N, C. But note: we have A in position 3, which is new.\n\n However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? But we don\'t have any correct position yet.\n\n But we know A is not in position 2, so we are safe to use A in positions 1,3,4,5.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden, so no.\n\n How about ""SPLAT"": S, P, L, A, T -> A in position 4? \n   S(1), P(2), L(3), A(4), T(5). This uses common letters and A in a new position (4).\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has S, P, L, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 1 and also includes S and T, which are common.\n\n Let me choose ""ALOFT"" as it has A in position 1 and then L, O, F, T. But F is less common. \n\n Another word: ""ABOUT"" -> but B, O, U, T. But we don\'t know about B and U. And we avoid R, N, E, C. But U is a vowel, but not as common.\n\n How about ""AISLE""? -> but E is forbidden, so no.\n\n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has A in position 1 and then U, D, I, O. This uses vowels and D. But we don\'t know if the word has U, D, I, O.\n\n However, ""AUDIO"" is a good word for getting vowels, but we already know A is in the word, and we are avoiding E. We also know that the word doesn\'t have R, so we are safe.\n\n But we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can try to cover more consonants.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden, so no.\n\n After considering, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it has A in position 3 (a new position) and uses common letters P, L, I, T.\n\n But note: we have not used S yet, which is a very common letter.\n\n How about ""PASTY""? But Y is less common. And we have A in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2. So no.\n\n Another idea: ""STOMP"" -> but no A. We must include A.\n\n So let\'s go with a word that has A in position 1 and includes S and T: \n   ""ASTIR"" -> but R is forbidden, so no.\n   ""ASTER"" -> E and R forbidden.\n\n How about ""ASHES"" -> E and S repeated? And E is forbidden.\n\n How about ""ASSET"" -> E is forbidden? No, because we have E in the last position? But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.\n\n So without E, what about ""ASSAM""? But that has two A\'s and two S\'s? And M? But we don\'t know.\n\n Another: ""ATOMS"": A in position 1, then T, O, M, S. This uses A in position 1 and T, O, M, S. All are new and common.\n\n So ""ATOMS"": \n   A (position1) -> we don\'t know if it\'s correct, but we are testing A in position1.\n   T (position2)\n   O (position3)\n   M (position4)\n   S (position5)\n\n This word: \n   - Includes A (which we know is in the word) in a new position (1).\n   - Uses common letters: T, O, M, S.\n   - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n So I think ""ATOMS"" is a good second guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""ALOFT"" or ""ADOPT"", but ""ATOMS"" has S which is very common.\n\n Let me choose ""ATOMS"".\n\n So the second guess: ""ATOMS""\n\n We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n But note: we are not sure if A is in position 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or nothing? But we know A is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 1, we should get a dash for A.\n\n So let\'s go with ""ATOMS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- A is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes A (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoids position 2.\n2. Excludes C, R, N, E.\n3. Uses new common letters to maximize information.\n\nI chose ""atoms"" because:\n- A is in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces common letters: T, O, M, S.\n- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.\n- It avoids forbidden letters and position 2 for A.\n\n<guess>atoms</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: atoms -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word, but wrong position; so A is in the word, but not at position 2)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""atoms""\n  A: ✓ (correct, so A is in the word and in position 1)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  O: - (in the word, but not at position 3)\n  M: - (in the word, but not at position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this we know:\n\n- The secret word has A in the first position. (Because we got a check for A in position 1 in ""atoms"".)\n- The secret word contains O and M, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (from ""atoms"" feedback).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, T, S.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we already knew A is in the word (and now we know it\'s at position 1) and that C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n\nNow, we know the first letter is A.\n\nWe also know that O and M are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions. We must avoid positions 3 for O and 4 for M? Actually, the feedback for O is that it is in the word but not at position 3, and for M, not at position 4.\n\nAdditionally, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.\n\nSo, the available letters are: A (fixed at position 1), O, M, and then we need two more letters. We don\'t know what they are, so we have to guess.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses left (since we used 2).\n\nNow, we can think of words that start with A, have O and M (but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively), and do not contain C, R, N, E, T, S.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know the positions of O and M. They can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but with constraints: O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback) and M cannot be at position 4.\n\nBut note: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position, so O is in the word but not at 3. Similarly, M was at position 4 and marked wrong position, so M is in the word but not at 4.\n\nNow, the word structure:\n\nPosition 1: A (fixed)\n\nWe need to place O and M in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:\n- O cannot be at position 3.\n- M cannot be at position 4.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to fill, which are unknown.\n\nWe should try to cover common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. The letters we haven\'t tried are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common ones: like L, I, P, U, D, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters, starting with A, and containing O and M.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words that start with A, have O and M, and two other letters from the available set.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ALO?M? -> but we have to avoid S, T, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- ALOUD: but D is allowed? Yes, but we have O and U and D. But we don\'t have M? So no.\n- AMMON: but M repeated? And N is forbidden. Also, we don\'t have O? Wait, AMMON has two M\'s and O? Actually, AMMON is not a word? Let me think of valid words.\n\nActually, we need words that have exactly the letters: A, O, M, and two others.\n\nCommon words:\n- ALOHA: but H is allowed? But we don\'t have M. So no.\n- ATOLL: but T and L? T is forbidden (from guess2: T is x). So no.\n- AXIOM: but X and I? And we have O and M. But we also have I. And X is allowed? But let\'s check: A, X, I, O, M. But we have two vowels? And we know the word has A, O, M, so that\'s three, plus X and I. But is ""axiom"" a word? Yes. But we have to check the positions.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T and S, which we are. Also, we haven\'t used X and I.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: in ""atoms"", we had O at position 3 (which was wrong) and M at position 4 (wrong). So in ""axiom"", we would have:\n  A at 1 (correct, we know)\n  X at 2\n  I at 3\n  O at 4\n  M at 5\n\nBut we know O cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""axiom"", O is at position 4, which is allowed (since the feedback only said O is not at 3, but it can be at 4). Similarly, M is at position 5, which is allowed (since M cannot be at 4, but 5 is fine).\n\nSo ""axiom"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we don\'t know if X and I are in the word. We are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has O and M in different positions to test more possibilities.\n\nBut we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ALBUM"" -> A, L, B, U, M. This has M at the end, which is position 5. And O? We don\'t have O. But we know O is in the word, so we must include O. So ""album"" doesn\'t have O, so it cannot be the word.\n\nWe must include O and M.\n\nAnother: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This has O at the end, but no M. So no.\n\n""AMPLY"": A, M, P, L, Y. This has M at position 2? But we don\'t have O. So no.\n\nWe need a word that has both O and M.\n\nLet me list words: \n- AMMONIA -> too long, we need 5 letters.\n- AXIOM: as above.\n- AROMAS: but S is forbidden and we have two A\'s? But we know A is at position 1, so if we put A at position 1 and then another A? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, S is forbidden. So no.\n- ALOFT: we tried in the previous step? But we didn\'t use it. But in ""atoms"" we have T and S as not in the word, and T is in ""aloft"", so we cannot use ""aloft"" because T is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADOPT"" has T, forbidden.\n\nSo back to ""axiom"": A, X, I, O, M.\n\nBut X and I are not very common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""ABHOM"" -> not a word.\n\n""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O. This has M at position 2 and O at position 5. But we have to check the positions: \n  Position 1: A (correct)\n  Position 2: M -> but we don\'t know if M can be at 2? The feedback only said M is not at 4, so it can be at 2.\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: G\n  Position 5: O\n\nBut we also have O at position 5, which is allowed (since we only know O is not at 3).\n\nSo ""amigo"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""AMINO"": but N is forbidden, so no.\n\n""AMPLY"": no O.\n\n""AVOID"": A, V, O, I, D. This has O at position 3? But we know O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback). So if we put O at 3, it would be wrong. But we are trying to avoid that. So we cannot put O at 3.\n\nIn ""avoid"", O is at position 3, which is the forbidden position for O? So we should avoid that because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABOUT"": O at position 3? Also forbidden.\n\nSo we must avoid putting O at position 3.\n\nIn ""amigo"", O is at 5, which is fine.\n\nAnother candidate: ""ALOHA"" -> no M.\n\n""MAYOR"": but M is at position 1? But we need A at position 1. So no.\n\nWe need A at 1.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""amigo"" and ""axiom"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has O and M and uses common letters we haven\'t tried, like L, I, P, U, etc.\n\nBut in ""amigo"", we have I and G.\n\nIn ""axiom"", we have X and I.\n\nX is less common, so maybe ""amigo"" is better.\n\nBut let\'s see: we know the word has M, and in ""amigo"", M is at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct or not.\n\nSimilarly, in ""axiom"", M is at position 5.\n\nWe also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have any indication of that yet.\n\nAnother word: ""AUDIO"" -> no M.\n\n""AMASS"" -> S is forbidden and no O.\n\n""AMONG"": A, M, O, N, G. But N is forbidden (from guess1: N is x). So no.\n\n""AMOUR"": A, M, O, U, R. But R is forbidden (from guess1: R is x). So no.\n\n""AMPLE"": E is forbidden. So no.\n\nSo the candidates are limited.\n\nAnother: ""ALBUM"" -> no O.\n\n""ANIMI"" -> N forbidden.\n\n""APIOL"" -> not common.\n\n""APPLE"" -> P, P, L, E -> E forbidden.\n\nSo I think ""amigo"" and ""axiom"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut let\'s try to think of a word with O and M and without forbidden letters, and A at start.\n\n""AMOWE"" -> not a word.\n\n""AVOWE"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""ABOMA"" -> but B, O, M, A. But we have two A\'s? And O and M. So ""aboma"": A, B, O, M, A. But we have A at position 1 and 5. We know A is at position 1, so if we put A at 5, it might be correct or not? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have to avoid putting O and M in forbidden positions.\n\nIn ""aboma"": \n  A at 1: correct\n  B at 2\n  O at 3 -> but O cannot be at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O was at 3 and was wrong position). So if we put O at 3, it will be wrong again. So we should avoid that.\n\nSo ""aboma"" is invalid because O is at 3.\n\nSimilarly, any word with O at 3 is invalid.\n\nSo we must have O at position 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, M cannot be at 4, so M at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words:\n\n- O at 2: then M at 3 or 5 (since M cannot be at 4, and 4 is available for other letters). But if O is at 2, then M can be at 3? But position 3 is available for M? We don\'t have constraint on M at 3? Only that M cannot be at 4.\n\nFor example: \n  A, O, M, ?, ? -> but then M at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for other letters.\n\nBut we need to form a word: e.g., ""AOM??"" -> not many words. ""AOMIA"" -> not a word? ""AORTA"" -> but R and T forbidden.\n\n- O at 4: then M can be at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nFor example: \n  A, ?, ?, O, M -> e.g., ""AXIOM"" (if we put O at 4 and M at 5? In ""axiom"", it\'s A, X, I, O, M -> so O at 4, M at 5. That works.\n\n- O at 5: then M can be at 2 or 3.\n\nFor example: ""AMIGO"": A, M, I, G, O -> O at 5, M at 2.\n\nOr ""A??OM"": e.g., ""AUDOM"" not a word.\n\nSo the two best candidates are ""axiom"" (with O at 4 and M at 5) and ""amigo"" (with M at 2 and O at 5).\n\nWe can choose one to test.\n\nBut we also want to cover new letters. In ""amigo"", we use M, I, G, O. In ""axiom"", we use X, I, O, M.\n\nWe haven\'t used I, G, X.\n\nG is more common than X, so ""amigo"" might be better? But we are not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to include L or U or other common letters.\n\nIs there a word like ""AULOI""? Not common.\n\n""ALOIN"" -> N forbidden.\n\n""ALMUG"" -> not common.\n\n""AMIGO"" seems reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nWe know the first letter is A, so we can focus on the other positions.\n\nWe have to guess: I\'ll go with ""amigo"" because it uses more common letters.\n\nSo third guess: ""amigo""\n\nBut let\'s write it: AMIGO\n\nWe\'ll see if M is at 2, O at 5, and what about I and G.\n\nBut note: in ""amigo"", we have:\n  Position 1: A (correct)\n  Position 2: M -> we don\'t know if it\'s correct or not. It could be correct or wrong position.\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: G\n  Position 5: O\n\nWe know O is in the word, and we are putting it at 5, which is allowed. Similarly, M is at 2, which is allowed (since we only know M is not at 4).\n\nSo we\'ll get feedback on M, I, G, O.\n\nBut we are not sure.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put M and O in positions we are unsure about, but we have to include them.\n\nAnother idea: since we know O is not at 3, and M not at 4, we can try to put O at 2 and M at 5, for example.\n\nIs there a word: A, O, ?, ?, M\n\nFor example: ""AOXOM"" not a word.\n\n""ABOHM"" not common.\n\n""ADOBE"" -> E forbidden.\n\nSo not many options.\n\nTherefore, I think ""amigo"" is a good choice.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the word but not in position 2. C, R, N, E are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2 (atoms)**: A is correct in position 1. O and M are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively. T and S are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **A**.\n- It contains **O** and **M**, but:\n  - O cannot be in position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback).\n  - M cannot be in position 4 (from ""atoms"" feedback).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S.\n- Remaining letters to consider: Common unused letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Since A is fixed at position 1, focus on placing O and M in valid positions (O not at 3, M not at 4) while testing new common letters.\n- Choose a word that:\n  - Starts with A.\n  - Includes O and M.\n  - Uses new, common letters (e.g., I, G, L, P) to maximize information.\n  - Avoids excluded letters and forbidden positions for O and M.\n\nAfter evaluating options like ""axiom"" (less common letters) and ""amigo"" (common letters), **""amigo""** is selected because:\n- It places A in position 1 (correct).\n- It tests M in position 2 (allowed, since M cannot be at 4 but position 2 is new).\n- It tests O in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be at 3 but position 5 is new).\n- It introduces new common letters I (position 3) and G (position 4), which haven\'t been tested yet.\n- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E, T, S).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of O and M and reveal if I or G are in the word.\n\n<guess>amigo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: atoms -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: amigo -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(-) I(✓) G(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word, wrong position) -> now we know A is at position 1 from guess 2
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: atoms
  A: ✓ (correct position 1)
  T: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
  M: - (in the word, wrong position) -> not at position 4
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: amigo
  A: ✓ (correct position 1)
  M: - (in the word, wrong position) -> but in this guess, M was at position 2, so M is not at position 2
  I: ✓ (correct position 3)
  G: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, wrong position) -> in this guess, O was at position 5, so O is not at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Position 1: A (fixed)
2. Position 3: I (fixed) because we got a check for I at position 3.

3. Letters in the word: A, I, O, M (all confirmed by feedback)
   - A and I have fixed positions: 1 and 3.
   - O and M are in the word but their positions are not fixed.

4. We know the positions where O and M cannot be:
   - O cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2) and cannot be at position 5 (from guess 3). Therefore, O must be at position 2 or 4.
   - M cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2) and cannot be at position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, M must be at position 3 or 5. But position 3 is now fixed as I, so M cannot be at position 3. Thus, M must be at position 5.

Wait, let's be careful:

- M cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2: atoms had M at 4 and it was wrong)
- M cannot be at position 2 (from guess 3: amigo had M at 2 and it was wrong)
- Positions for M: only 1,2,3,4,5 are available? But position 1 is A, and position 3 is I (fixed), so M cannot be at 1 or 3 anyway. Therefore, M can only be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are ruled out? No, position 4 was ruled out? Only position 5 remains.

Positions:
  1: A
  2: ?
  3: I
  4: ?
  5: ?

For O: cannot be at 3 (known from guess 2) and cannot be at 5 (from guess 3). So O can only be at 2 or 4.

For M: cannot be at 2 (guess 3) and cannot be at 4 (guess 2). And it cannot be at 1 or 3 because position 1 is A and position 3 is I. So the only position left for M is 5.

Therefore:
- Position 5: M (must be, because it's the only position left)

Then O must be at either 2 or 4.

But we have position 4 left? And position 2.

Now, the word so far: A _ I _ M

And we have O either at 2 or at 4.

But we also need to fill position 2 and 4 with letters that are not forbidden and that form a valid word.

We know that G is not in the word (from guess 3) and previously excluded: C, R, N, E, T, S.

Available positions:
  Position 2: either O or another letter? But O might be there.

Actually, the word has exactly five letters: A, (position 2), I, (position 4), M.

We know the letters in the word: A, I, O, M. That's four letters. So we need one more letter, say X, for the remaining position.

But we have two positions: 2 and 4. One of them is O, and the other is the unknown letter.

So possible structures:

Option 1: Position 2 is O, then position 4 is X (unknown letter)
   Word: A O I X M

Option 2: Position 2 is X (unknown), position 4 is O
   Word: A X I O M

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters. Also, not using excluded letters: C,R,N,E,T,S,G.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S, G.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find such words.

First, option 1: A O I _ M
  Position 4: we need a letter, say Z. Then the word is A O I Z M.

Are there any English words like this?
  AOISM? Not a word.
  AOILM? No.

Common words? I can't think of any.

Option 2: A _ I O M
  This looks more promising: the word might be ""A ?? I O M""

What about ""ALIOM""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""ABIOM"" or ""ADIOM"" — not real words.

But wait, let's think: have you heard of the word ""AXIOM""? But we tried that earlier? But note: ""axiom"" is A X I O M — which matches exactly A _ I O M, with position 2 being X and position 4 being O? No, in A X I O M:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: X
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: O
  Position 5: M

That is: A X I O M

But we have O at position 4? And we know O can be at position 4? Yes, because we only ruled out positions 3 and 5 for O.

Similarly, M is at position 5? But we concluded M must be at position 5? Yes.

So ""axiom"" fits perfectly: A X I O M

But in guess 3, we guessed ""amigo"", and now we think of ""axiom"".

But let's confirm the feedback we got for ""axiom"" if it were the word? No, we haven't guessed it yet.

But we also have to check if the letters are allowed.

In ""axiom"", the letters are A, X, I, O, M.

I is fixed at position 3? In ""axiom"", I is at position 3, and we got a check for I at position 3? Yes, so that matches.

Also, O is at position 4, and we have a dash for O in previous guesses? But now we are going to guess it.

Also, M is at position 5.

But we have not excluded X? In fact, we haven't tested X.

But we know G is not in the word? In ""amigo"", G was x, so G is not in the word.

Similarly, X has not been tested, so we don't know if it's allowed? But we are allowed to use it because it hasn't been excluded.

Now, the word ""axiom"": 
  - A at 1: correct
  - X: unknown
  - I at 3: correct
  - O at 4: and we need to see if it's correct
  - M at 5: correct

But according to our deduction, M must be at position 5? Based on the constraints.

In fact, since we have A _ I _ M, and O must be at 2 or 4, and position 3 is I, then:

- If O were at position 2, then position 4 must be an unknown letter? But what word? And we couldn't find one.

- If O is at position 4, then position 2 is unknown.

And ""axiom"" has O at position 4? Position 4 is O? Actually, in ""axiom"", the positions are:
  1: A
  2: X
  3: I
  4: O
  5: M

So it uses position 4 for O and position 5 for M.

And position 2 is X.

So it satisfies: position 5 for M (as we deduced) and position 4 for O (which is allowed, since O cannot be at 3 or 5).

Moreover, we have one unknown letter: X at position 2.

But since we know all the letters: A, O, I, M are in the word, and only one letter left? Actually, the word has five letters: A, X, I, O, M — so X must be the fifth letter.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""axiom"" because it is the only word that fits the pattern and constraints.

But let's double-check if we missed any word.

Is there any other word with the pattern A _ I O M?

For example: ""ALIOM""? No.
""ABIOM""? Not a word.
""AVIOM""? Not a word.
""AKIOM""? Not a word.

Or with A O I _ M? Like ""AOIBM""? No.

Therefore, ""axiom"" seems to be the only possible word.

But we must confirm: is ""axiom"" a valid five-letter English word? Yes, it is.

So we can guess ""axiom"" for guess 4.

But note: we haven't tested position 2? But we deduced that the word must be ""axiom"".

Alternatively, we can think that position 2 could be something else? But no other words come to mind.

Therefore, I will guess ""axiom"".

But let's see what the feedback tells us.

To be safe, we can guess it.

So fourth guess: ""axiom""
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Starting with what we know from previous feedback:**

1. **Position 1**: Must be `A` (confirmed correct in Guess 2 and Guess 3).
2. **Position 3**: Must be `I` (confirmed correct in Guess 3).
3. **Confirmed letters in the word**: `A`, `I`, `O`, `M` (all verified by feedback).
4. **Excluded letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` (from Guess 1), `T`, `S` (from Guess 2), and `G` (from Guess 3).
5. **Constraints for `O` and `M`**:
   - `O` cannot be at position 3 (from Guess 2 feedback) or position 5 (from Guess 3 feedback). So `O` must be at position 2 or 4.
   - `M` cannot be at position 2 (from Guess 3 feedback) or position 4 (from Guess 2 feedback). It also cannot be at position 1 or 3 (fixed as `A` and `I`). Therefore, `M` must be at position 5.
6. **Position of `M`**: Fixed at position 5 due to elimination (only position left).
7. **Position of `O`**: Since `M` occupies position 5, and `O` cannot be at positions 3 or 5, `O` must be at position 4 (the only remaining option between 2 and 4, once position 2 is considered for another letter).  
   - *Why not position 2?* If `O` were at position 2, the word would be `A O I ? M`. However, no common English word fits this pattern without using excluded letters (e.g., `AOI` is invalid). Thus, `O` must be at position 4.

**Deducing the word structure:**  
- Position 1: `A`  
- Position 3: `I`  
- Position 4: `O` (deduced above)  
- Position 5: `M`  
- Position 2: One unknown letter (call it `X`).  
The word must follow the pattern `A X I O M`, where `X` is any unused English letter not excluded.

**Finding valid words:**  
- Possible words matching `A X I O M`: 
  - `AXIOM`: A valid English word meaning a statement or principle. Letters: `A`, `X`, `I`, `O`, `M`.  
- Other candidates (e.g., `ABIOM`, `ALIOM`, `ADIOM`) are not valid English words.  
- `AXIOM` uses `X`, which is not excluded (never tested), and avoids all forbidden letters (`C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `T`, `S`, `G`).  

**Conclusion:**  
- Given the constraints, `axiom` is the only valid English word that fits all feedback.  
- Since we have 3 guesses left, this guess could potentially solve the puzzle.

<guess>axiom</guess>",axiom,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word, wrong position) -> now we know A is at position 1 from guess 2
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: atoms
  A: ✓ (correct position 1)
  T: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, wrong position) -> not at position 3
  M: - (in the word, wrong position) -> not at position 4
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: amigo
  A: ✓ (correct position 1)
  M: - (in the word, wrong position) -> but in this guess, M was at position 2, so M is not at position 2
  I: ✓ (correct position 3)
  G: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word, wrong position) -> in this guess, O was at position 5, so O is not at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Position 1: A (fixed)
2. Position 3: I (fixed) because we got a check for I at position 3.

3. Letters in the word: A, I, O, M (all confirmed by feedback)
   - A and I have fixed positions: 1 and 3.
   - O and M are in the word but their positions are not fixed.

4. We know the positions where O and M cannot be:
   - O cannot be at position 3 (from guess 2) and cannot be at position 5 (from guess 3). Therefore, O must be at position 2 or 4.
   - M cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2) and cannot be at position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, M must be at position 3 or 5. But position 3 is now fixed as I, so M cannot be at position 3. Thus, M must be at position 5.

Wait, let's be careful:

- M cannot be at position 4 (from guess 2: atoms had M at 4 and it was wrong)
- M cannot be at position 2 (from guess 3: amigo had M at 2 and it was wrong)
- Positions for M: only 1,2,3,4,5 are available? But position 1 is A, and position 3 is I (fixed), so M cannot be at 1 or 3 anyway. Therefore, M can only be at position 5? Because positions 2 and 4 are ruled out? No, position 4 was ruled out? Only position 5 remains.

Positions:
  1: A
  2: ?
  3: I
  4: ?
  5: ?

For O: cannot be at 3 (known from guess 2) and cannot be at 5 (from guess 3). So O can only be at 2 or 4.

For M: cannot be at 2 (guess 3) and cannot be at 4 (guess 2). And it cannot be at 1 or 3 because position 1 is A and position 3 is I. So the only position left for M is 5.

Therefore:
- Position 5: M (must be, because it's the only position left)

Then O must be at either 2 or 4.

But we have position 4 left? And position 2.

Now, the word so far: A _ I _ M

And we have O either at 2 or at 4.

But we also need to fill position 2 and 4 with letters that are not forbidden and that form a valid word.

We know that G is not in the word (from guess 3) and previously excluded: C, R, N, E, T, S.

Available positions:
  Position 2: either O or another letter? But O might be there.

Actually, the word has exactly five letters: A, (position 2), I, (position 4), M.

We know the letters in the word: A, I, O, M. That's four letters. So we need one more letter, say X, for the remaining position.

But we have two positions: 2 and 4. One of them is O, and the other is the unknown letter.

So possible structures:

Option 1: Position 2 is O, then position 4 is X (unknown letter)
   Word: A O I X M

Option 2: Position 2 is X (unknown), position 4 is O
   Word: A X I O M

We need to find a 5-letter word that matches one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters. Also, not using excluded letters: C,R,N,E,T,S,G.

Excluded letters: C, R, N, E, T, S, G.

Common letters left: B, D, F, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find such words.

First, option 1: A O I _ M
  Position 4: we need a letter, say Z. Then the word is A O I Z M.

Are there any English words like this?
  AOISM? Not a word.
  AOILM? No.

Common words? I can't think of any.

Option 2: A _ I O M
  This looks more promising: the word might be ""A ?? I O M""

What about ""ALIOM""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""ABIOM"" or ""ADIOM"" — not real words.

But wait, let's think: have you heard of the word ""AXIOM""? But we tried that earlier? But note: ""axiom"" is A X I O M — which matches exactly A _ I O M, with position 2 being X and position 4 being O? No, in A X I O M:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: X
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: O
  Position 5: M

That is: A X I O M

But we have O at position 4? And we know O can be at position 4? Yes, because we only ruled out positions 3 and 5 for O.

Similarly, M is at position 5? But we concluded M must be at position 5? Yes.

So ""axiom"" fits perfectly: A X I O M

But in guess 3, we guessed ""amigo"", and now we think of ""axiom"".

But let's confirm the feedback we got for ""axiom"" if it were the word? No, we haven't guessed it yet.

But we also have to check if the letters are allowed.

In ""axiom"", the letters are A, X, I, O, M.

I is fixed at position 3? In ""axiom"", I is at position 3, and we got a check for I at position 3? Yes, so that matches.

Also, O is at position 4, and we have a dash for O in previous guesses? But now we are going to guess it.

Also, M is at position 5.

But we have not excluded X? In fact, we haven't tested X.

But we know G is not in the word? In ""amigo"", G was x, so G is not in the word.

Similarly, X has not been tested, so we don't know if it's allowed? But we are allowed to use it because it hasn't been excluded.

Now, the word ""axiom"": 
  - A at 1: correct
  - X: unknown
  - I at 3: correct
  - O at 4: and we need to see if it's correct
  - M at 5: correct

But according to our deduction, M must be at position 5? Based on the constraints.

In fact, since we have A _ I _ M, and O must be at 2 or 4, and position 3 is I, then:

- If O were at position 2, then position 4 must be an unknown letter? But what word? And we couldn't find one.

- If O is at position 4, then position 2 is unknown.

And ""axiom"" has O at position 4? Position 4 is O? Actually, in ""axiom"", the positions are:
  1: A
  2: X
  3: I
  4: O
  5: M

So it uses position 4 for O and position 5 for M.

And position 2 is X.

So it satisfies: position 5 for M (as we deduced) and position 4 for O (which is allowed, since O cannot be at 3 or 5).

Moreover, we have one unknown letter: X at position 2.

But since we know all the letters: A, O, I, M are in the word, and only one letter left? Actually, the word has five letters: A, X, I, O, M — so X must be the fifth letter.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""axiom"" because it is the only word that fits the pattern and constraints.

But let's double-check if we missed any word.

Is there any other word with the pattern A _ I O M?

For example: ""ALIOM""? No.
""ABIOM""? Not a word.
""AVIOM""? Not a word.
""AKIOM""? Not a word.

Or with A O I _ M? Like ""AOIBM""? No.

Therefore, ""axiom"" seems to be the only possible word.

But we must confirm: is ""axiom"" a valid five-letter English word? Yes, it is.

So we can guess ""axiom"" for guess 4.

But note: we haven't tested position 2? But we deduced that the word must be ""axiom"".

Alternatively, we can think that position 2 could be something else? But no other words come to mind.

Therefore, I will guess ""axiom"".

But let's see what the feedback tells us.

To be safe, we can guess it.
