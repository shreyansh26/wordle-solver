We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter).
 - C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since E is correct at the 5th position, the secret word ends with E.

 We know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. So we should avoid these letters.

 For the next guess, we need:
 - A 5-letter word that ends with E.
 - The word should not contain C, R, A, N.
 - And we should aim to test new common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since there are many possibilities, we need to choose a word that uses some of the remaining common letters.

 Considering that the first four letters are unknown and we have excluded C, R, A, N, and E is fixed at the end.

 What are some common words ending in E?
 Let's think of words that use frequent consonants: S, T, L, etc.

 Example: 
   ""SLICE"" - but I is a vowel and we don't know about vowels yet? Actually we know A is absent, but we haven't tested O, U, I? 
   However, note: we have tested A and found absent, so vowels left: O, U, I? But E is present and correct.

 But wait: the feedback said A is absent, so we avoid A. We don't know about I, O, U.

 Also, the word must not contain the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

 I am considering ""SPIKE"" but E is at the end? No, E is at the 5th, so we need a word ending with E.

 Common 5-letter words ending in E: ""slice"", ""spite"", ""slate"", ""shade"", etc. But remember to avoid C, R, A, N.

 Since we must avoid A and C, let's skip words with A or C.

 Let's choose a word that includes S, T, L, and possibly others.

 Example: ""PRONE"" -> P, R (but R is absent) -> so not possible because R is absent.

 R is absent? Feedback said R(x) meaning R is absent. So we must avoid R.

 Then what about ""SLIME"": S, L, I, M, E -> but E is at the end? We can use S, L, I, M as the first four? Then ""SLIME"".

 However, note: we haven't tested I, so that could be good.

 Another example: ""SOUPE""? But O and U? Alternatively, ""STOLE""?

 But we must avoid R and A and N and C.

 Considering ""STOLE"":
   S, T, O, L, E -> ends with E, and none of C,R,A,N -> seems valid.

 But note: the word ""stole"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SPOKE"": S, P, O, K, E -> also valid.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Letters in ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> we know E is already present and correct at the end, but we are testing S, T, O, L.

 Similarly, ""SPOKE"": S, P, O, K, E -> tests S, P, O, K.

 I think ""SPOKE"" is better because we test P, O, K and S? And K is a common consonant.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> but N was absent! We cannot use N because it was marked absent. So N is out.

 Therefore, ""SHINE"" is invalid because of N.

 Similarly, ""TRIED"" has R and we cannot use R.

 So back to ""SPOKS""? Not a word.

 Or ""SHOWE""? Not sure.

 Let me think of other words: ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E -> but we haven't tested U? But O and U are new. But note: the 5th letter is E, so it must be fixed.

 But ""MOUSE"" contains E at the end? Yes. Letters: M, O, U, S, E -> none of the absent letters? Yes, avoids C,R,A,N.

 Alternatively, ""HOUSE"" -> same, avoids C,R,A,N.

 Or ""SLATE"" -> but A is absent, so we avoid A -> ""SLATE"" has A, so invalid.

 We can use ""PLUME"", but U and M? 

 Let's choose among:
   ""SPOKE"": S, P, O, K, E -> tests S, P, O, K
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L
   ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S

 ""SPOKE"" and ""MOUSE"" cover more different letters? 

 ""SPOKE"" has P, O, K, S and E (E already known).
 ""MOUSE"" has M, O, U, S and E.

 Both are good. I'll pick ""MOUSE"" because it includes U, a vowel we haven't tested.

 But note: we already did one guess and found E present. Now we are testing the first four letters.

 Let's decide: which one has more common letters?

 Perhaps ""SPOKE"" because it avoids U which is less common? But I think both are fine.

 Alternatively, we might use ""SPIKE"" but we don't know about I? And we need to avoid absent letters? ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> avoids C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, note: K is used in ""spike"", O in ""spoke"".

 I'll go with ""SPOKE"" because it has O (a vowel) and K (a consonant) and P and S.

 But we already tested E? We are using E in the correct position.

 So the guess: ""SPOKE""

 However, note: the word might contain E elsewhere? The feedback only said E is at the fifth position. But since E is at fifth, we don't know if there is another E? The feedback only shows the position for the letters we guessed. But if a letter is repeated, we don't know.

 But since we didn't get any other E in the feedback for ""crane"", and we didn't have other E in ""crane"", so perhaps the word has only one E? Not necessarily: because if we had guessed two E's, then we would see multiple marks. But in ""crane"", we had only one E.

 However, we might encounter words with double E? Like ""agape"" or ""elite"" but our word does not end in E? In our case, the fifth is E, so a word ending with E, but it might have another E? For example, ""APPLE"" ends with E and has E? But note: ""APPLE"" has two E's? Actually, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E -> so only one E? No, E at the end. Actually, ""APPLE"" has only one E at the end.

 It's possible to have words with two E's: e.g., ""BELLE"", but then we would have an E in the first position and the fifth? Then if we guess ""crane"", which has E only at the fifth, then the other E would not be guessed so we don't know. So it's uncertain.

 But to keep it simple, for now, we assume we haven't tested for additional E's. 

 So I choose ""spoke"".

 Therefore, I'll guess: SPOKE

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **E** is in the word **and in the correct position** (5th letter).
- **C, R, A, N** are **not in the word**.

This means:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- The first four letters **exclude C, R, A, N**.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Choose a 5-letter word ending in **E**.
2. Avoid using **C, R, A, N** since they’re absent.
3. Test new common letters, especially vowels like **O, I, U** or common consonants like **S, T, P, L**.

Possible word options:
- **MOUSE** (tests M, O, U, S)
- **SPIKE** (tests S, P, I, K)
- **STOLE** (tests S, T, O, L)

I select **SPOKE** because it:
- Ends in **E**.
- Avoids C, R, A, N.
- Tests four new high-frequency letters: **S, P, O, K**.

This maximizes information gain about the word’s composition and positions.

 We can use ""PLUME"", but U and M? 

 Let's choose among:
   ""SPOKE"": S, P, O, K, E -> tests S, P, O, K
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> tests S, T, O, L
   ""MOUSE"": M, O, U, S, E -> tests M, O, U, S

 ""SPOKE"" and ""MOUSE"" cover more different letters? 

 ""SPOKE"" has P, O, K, S and E (E already known).
 ""MOUSE"" has M, O, U, S and E.

 Both are good. I'll pick ""MOUSE"" because it includes U, a vowel we haven't tested.

 But note: we already did one guess and found E present. Now we are testing the first four letters.

 Let's decide: which one has more common letters?

 Perhaps ""SPOKE"" because it avoids U which is less common? But I think both are fine.

 Alternatively, we might use ""SPIKE"" but we don't know about I? And we need to avoid absent letters? ""SPIKE"": S, P, I, K, E -> avoids C,R,A,N -> valid.

 However, note: K is used in ""spike"", O in ""spoke"".

 I'll go with ""SPOKE"" because it has O (a vowel) and K (a consonant) and P and S.

 But we already tested E? We are using E in the correct position.

 So the guess: ""SPOKE""

 However, note: the word might contain E elsewhere? The feedback only said E is at the fifth position. But since E is at fifth, we don't know if there is another E? The feedback only shows the position for the letters we guessed. But if a letter is repeated, we don't know.

 But since we didn't get any other E in the feedback for ""crane"", and we didn't have other E in ""crane"", so perhaps the word has only one E? Not necessarily: because if we had guessed two E's, then we would see multiple marks. But in ""crane"", we had only one E.

 However, we might encounter words with double E? Like ""agape"" or ""elite"" but our word does not end in E? In our case, the fifth is E, so a word ending with E, but it might have another E? For example, ""APPLE"" ends with E and has E? But note: ""APPLE"" has two E's? Actually, ""APPLE"" is A, P, P, L, E -> so only one E? No, E at the end. Actually, ""APPLE"" has only one E at the end.

 It's possible to have words with two E's: e.g., ""BELLE"", but then we would have an E in the first position and the fifth? Then if we guess ""crane"", which has E only at the fifth, then the other E would not be guessed so we don't know. So it's uncertain.

 But to keep it simple, for now, we assume we haven't tested for additional E's. 

 So I choose ""spoke"".

 Therefore, I'll guess: SPOKE

<guess>spoke</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **E** is in the word **and in the correct position** (5th letter).
- **C, R, A, N** are **not in the word**.

This means:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- The first four letters **exclude C, R, A, N**.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Choose a 5-letter word ending in **E**.
2. Avoid using **C, R, A, N** since they’re absent.
3. Test new common letters, especially vowels like **O, I, U** or common consonants like **S, T, P, L**.

Possible word options:
- **MOUSE** (tests M, O, U, S)
- **SPIKE** (tests S, P, I, K)
- **STOLE** (tests S, T, O, L)

I select **SPOKE** because it:
- Ends in **E**.
- Avoids C, R, A, N.
- Tests four new high-frequency letters: **S, P, O, K**.

This maximizes information gain about the word’s composition and positions.

No, E is at the 5th, so we need a word ending with E.\n\n Common 5-letter words ending in E: ""slice"", ""spite"", ""slate"", ""shade"", etc. But remember to avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Since we must avoid A and C, let\'s skip words with A or C.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that includes S, T, L, and possibly others.\n\n Example: ""PRONE"" -> P, R (but R is absent) -> so not possible because R is absent.\n\n R is absent?

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is correct and in the 5th position.
   - C, R, A, N are absent.

2. ""spoke"" -> S(✓), P(x), O(✓), K(✓), E(✓)
   - S, O, K, E are correct and in their positions: S in 1st, O in 3rd, K in 4th, E in 5th.
   - P is absent.

From ""spoke"" feedback:
- The word has S at position 1, O at position 3, K at position 4, E at position 5.
- So the secret word is: S _ O K E

We know the word is: S _ O K E

We need to find the second letter.

Also, from previous absent letters: C, R, A, N, and P (from the second guess) are absent.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, P.

The secret word: Position 1: S, Position 3: O, Position 4: K, Position 5: E. Position 2 is unknown.

We need to find a word that fits: S _ O K E

What could the second letter be? It must be a letter not in the absent list (so not C,R,A,N,P) and must be a valid English letter.

Possible letters: Any letter except C,R,A,N,P and excluding the already known S,O,K,E? We can have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

But note: in ""crane"", we guessed E and it was the only E found, and in ""spoke"", we have E again at the end. If there were a double E elsewhere, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess two E's in one guess. However, for the second position, it could be E? But E is already at position 5, and if it were at position 2, then if we had guessed a word with E in position 2 earlier, we would have seen it. In ""crane"", E was at position 5, but we don't know about position 2.

But to be safe, we should consider all possibilities.

However, we have the constraint that the word must be a five-letter English word: S?O K E -> words like ""smoke"", ""stoke"", ""sooke"" not valid, ""spoke"" we already tried and we know P is absent.

Possible words: 
- Let me list words that fit the pattern S?OKE.

Common words:
- ""smoke"": S M O K E -> M is the second letter.
- ""stoke"": S T O K E -> T second letter.
- ""snoke"": not much common? Might not be valid.
- ""shake"": S H A K E -> but A is absent? The second letter in ""shake"" is H? But notice position 3 is A, not O, so no.
  Our word requires position 3 to be O.

So the pattern is S _ O K E.

Possible letters for position 2: 
We must avoid C,R,A,N,P.

Also, from ""crane"", we know A, R are absent so they won't be in the word.

Let's think: 
- ""smoke"" -> M
- ""stoke"" -> T

Other possibilities: ""scoke"", not a word; ""s'oke"", not valid; ""savoke"", not valid; etc.

Also, ""share"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

What about ""shone""? S H O N E -> but we have position 4 must be K? In ""shone"", it's O at position 3, but position 4 is N? So not S H O K E? Pattern: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> but we need position 4 to be K.

Similarly, ""stone"" has T and N? Position 4 is N? No.

The word must have S in position 1, then an unknown letter, O in position 3, K in position 4, E in position 5.

So the only common words I can think of are:
- ""smoke"": with M
- ""stoke"": with T

Now, we must consider if M and T are possible.

From the first guess ""crane"", T was not guessed? T wasn't tested? We tested C,R,A,N,E -> no T. Then in second guess ""spoke"", we didn't test T? Only S,P,O,K,E -> P was absent, but not T.

So T and M are both possibilities.

But we need to check which words are valid.

We also have absent letters: C, R, A, N, P.

So for second letter, can be any letter except those absent and also except S,O,K,E? Or might be one of these? For example, the second letter could be S? But S is at position 1.

But repeated letters: possible? For example, ""slike"" not a word? Or ""sooke"" not valid.

Actually, the word might have repeated letters. For instance, if second letter is O, then ""sooke"" is not a valid word.

Likely possibilities: M or T.

We can try ""smoke"".

But note: in the first guess, we guessed N and it was absent, but N is not in the second position.

Similarly, we haven't tested M or T.

But we only have to guess the word? We can guess either.

I think both ""smoke"" and ""stoke"" are valid words.

To cover, we need to see? But we don't know. We must guess one.

Perhaps we can pick one to test? Since we have the required pattern.

But note: the second guess already showed O, K, E in place? So we are only missing position 2.

If we guess ""smoke"" and the secret word is ""stoke"", then we get feedback with M marked absent? Similarly vice versa.

But we have more tries? We can try a word that is ""smoke"" or ""stoke"", and if it's incorrect, we use the feedback.

However, we can also try to find out more letters? But the word is almost complete.

But we need to choose between M and T? So directly guessing one is efficient.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests both possibilities? But in the same guess? How? For example, a word that includes M and T? But the pattern is fixed: S_ O K E. So the position is known.

Therefore, we must guess either ""smoke"" or ""stoke"".

Which one to choose? Both are common. We don't have additional context.

But in the first guess, we had ""crane"" which didn't have T or M? So no information.

We could look at commonality? Or just pick one.

I think ""smoke"" and ""stoke"" are both valid. I'll pick ""smoke"" arbitrarily.

But note: we already guessed ""spoke"" with P which is absent. So perhaps the secret word is ""smoke"" or ""stoke"".

I'll guess ""smoke"" to see.

But let me confirm the pattern: 
- ""smoke"" : S M O K E -> matches the pattern: S at 1, O at 3, K at 4, E at 5.

Similarly, ""stoke"": S T O K E.

So my next guess is: SMOKE

After, we can see feedback.

So <guess>smoke</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **From Guess 1 (CRANE):** E is confirmed in the 5th position, and C, R, A, N are absent.
- **From Guess 2 (SPOKE):** S, O, K, and E are all correct and in their exact positions (1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th), meaning the secret word follows the pattern: **S _ O K E**. The only unknown letter is the 2nd position. Additionally, P is absent.

### Key Information:
- Secret word format: **S ? O K E**
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, A, N, P**
- The 2nd-position letter must be:
  - Not C, R, A, N, or P
  - A valid English letter (a-z)
  - Able to form a real word within **S ? O K E**
  
### Analysis of Possible Words:
After filtering and considering common English words:
- **SMOKE** (M in 2nd position) is a valid candidate.
- **STOKE** (T in 2nd position) is another valid candidate.
- Both words satisfy the pattern and avoid absent letters.
- Since there are only two remaining likely words (SMOKE or STOKE), I'll prioritize **SMOKE** as it uses M, a common high-frequency consonant not yet tested, maximizing information gain.

### Reasoning Strategy:
- The guess **SMOKE** will either:
  - Be fully correct if the 2nd letter is M.
  - Reveal M as absent if incorrect, isolating **STOKE** as the solution.

<guess>smoke</guess>",smoke,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - E is correct and in the 5th position.
   - C, R, A, N are absent.

2. ""spoke"" -> S(✓), P(x), O(✓), K(✓), E(✓)
   - S, O, K, E are correct and in their positions: S in 1st, O in 3rd, K in 4th, E in 5th.
   - P is absent.

From ""spoke"" feedback:
- The word has S at position 1, O at position 3, K at position 4, E at position 5.
- So the secret word is: S _ O K E

We know the word is: S _ O K E

We need to find the second letter.

Also, from previous absent letters: C, R, A, N, and P (from the second guess) are absent.

So, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, P.

The secret word: Position 1: S, Position 3: O, Position 4: K, Position 5: E. Position 2 is unknown.

We need to find a word that fits: S _ O K E

What could the second letter be? It must be a letter not in the absent list (so not C,R,A,N,P) and must be a valid English letter.

Possible letters: Any letter except C,R,A,N,P and excluding the already known S,O,K,E? We can have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

But note: in ""crane"", we guessed E and it was the only E found, and in ""spoke"", we have E again at the end. If there were a double E elsewhere, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess two E's in one guess. However, for the second position, it could be E? But E is already at position 5, and if it were at position 2, then if we had guessed a word with E in position 2 earlier, we would have seen it. In ""crane"", E was at position 5, but we don't know about position 2.

But to be safe, we should consider all possibilities.

However, we have the constraint that the word must be a five-letter English word: S?O K E -> words like ""smoke"", ""stoke"", ""sooke"" not valid, ""spoke"" we already tried and we know P is absent.

Possible words: 
- Let me list words that fit the pattern S?OKE.

Common words:
- ""smoke"": S M O K E -> M is the second letter.
- ""stoke"": S T O K E -> T second letter.
- ""snoke"": not much common? Might not be valid.
- ""shake"": S H A K E -> but A is absent? The second letter in ""shake"" is H? But notice position 3 is A, not O, so no.
  Our word requires position 3 to be O.

So the pattern is S _ O K E.

Possible letters for position 2: 
We must avoid C,R,A,N,P.

Also, from ""crane"", we know A, R are absent so they won't be in the word.

Let's think: 
- ""smoke"" -> M
- ""stoke"" -> T

Other possibilities: ""scoke"", not a word; ""s'oke"", not valid; ""savoke"", not valid; etc.

Also, ""share"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

What about ""shone""? S H O N E -> but we have position 4 must be K? In ""shone"", it's O at position 3, but position 4 is N? So not S H O K E? Pattern: 1:S, 2:H, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> but we need position 4 to be K.

Similarly, ""stone"" has T and N? Position 4 is N? No.

The word must have S in position 1, then an unknown letter, O in position 3, K in position 4, E in position 5.

So the only common words I can think of are:
- ""smoke"": with M
- ""stoke"": with T

Now, we must consider if M and T are possible.

From the first guess ""crane"", T was not guessed? T wasn't tested? We tested C,R,A,N,E -> no T. Then in second guess ""spoke"", we didn't test T? Only S,P,O,K,E -> P was absent, but not T.

So T and M are both possibilities.

But we need to check which words are valid.

We also have absent letters: C, R, A, N, P.

So for second letter, can be any letter except those absent and also except S,O,K,E? Or might be one of these? For example, the second letter could be S? But S is at position 1.

But repeated letters: possible? For example, ""slike"" not a word? Or ""sooke"" not valid.

Actually, the word might have repeated letters. For instance, if second letter is O, then ""sooke"" is not a valid word.

Likely possibilities: M or T.

We can try ""smoke"".

But note: in the first guess, we guessed N and it was absent, but N is not in the second position.

Similarly, we haven't tested M or T.

But we only have to guess the word? We can guess either.

I think both ""smoke"" and ""stoke"" are valid words.

To cover, we need to see? But we don't know. We must guess one.

Perhaps we can pick one to test? Since we have the required pattern.

But note: the second guess already showed O, K, E in place? So we are only missing position 2.

If we guess ""smoke"" and the secret word is ""stoke"", then we get feedback with M marked absent? Similarly vice versa.

But we have more tries? We can try a word that is ""smoke"" or ""stoke"", and if it's incorrect, we use the feedback.

However, we can also try to find out more letters? But the word is almost complete.

But we need to choose between M and T? So directly guessing one is efficient.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that tests both possibilities? But in the same guess? How? For example, a word that includes M and T? But the pattern is fixed: S_ O K E. So the position is known.

Therefore, we must guess either ""smoke"" or ""stoke"".

But in the first guess, we had ""crane"" which didn't have T or M? So no information.

We could look at commonality? Or just pick one.

I think ""smoke"" and ""stoke"" are both valid. I'll pick ""smoke"" arbitrarily.

But note: we already guessed ""spoke"" with P which is absent. So perhaps the secret word is ""smoke"" or ""stoke"".

I'll guess ""smoke"" to see.

But let me confirm the pattern: 
- ""smoke"" : S M O K E -> matches the pattern: S at 1, O at 3, K at 4, E at 5.

Similarly, ""stoke"": S T O K E.

So my next guess is: SMOKE

After, we can see feedback.

So <guess>smoke</guess>Based on the feedback:
- **From Guess 1 (CRANE):** E is confirmed in the 5th position, and C, R, A, N are absent.
- **From Guess 2 (SPOKE):** S, O, K, and E are all correct and in their exact positions (1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th), meaning the secret word follows the pattern: **S _ O K E**. The only unknown letter is the 2nd position. Additionally, P is absent.

### Key Information:
- Secret word format: **S ? O K E**
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, A, N, P**
- The 2nd-position letter must be:
  - Not C, R, A, N, or P
  - A valid English letter (a-z)
  - Able to form a real word within **S ? O K E**
  
### Analysis of Possible Words:
After filtering and considering common English words:
- **SMOKE** (M in 2nd position) is a valid candidate.
- **STOKE** (T in 2nd position) is another valid candidate.
- Both words satisfy the pattern and avoid absent letters.
- Since there are only two remaining likely words (SMOKE or STOKE), I'll prioritize **SMOKE** as it uses M, a common high-frequency consonant not yet tested, maximizing information gain.

### Reasoning Strategy:
- The guess **SMOKE** will either:
  - Be fully correct if the 2nd letter is M.
  - Reveal M as absent if incorrect, isolating **STOKE** as the solution.",Guess 3: smoke -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) K(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
