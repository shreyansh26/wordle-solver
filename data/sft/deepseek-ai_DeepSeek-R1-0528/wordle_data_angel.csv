We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

We know that A, N, and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Also, C and R are absent.

The secret word contains A, N, E, and two other letters (since there are 5 letters). Since C and R are out, we need to avoid those.

Our goal is to make a new guess that includes A, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"". Also, we must not use C or R.

In ""crane"", the positions were:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

So, for the next guess:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We want to try a word that has A, N, E and two new letters. We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: we can try letters like T, L, S, O, U, etc.

We also note that the word must contain A, N, E, and two others (which could be among the unused letters).

Let's think of words that include A, N, E.

Some words: 
- lane (but only 4 letters) -> so no, must be 5 letters.
- plane -> but that's 5 letters? P-L-A-N-E. But we don't know about P and L. Also, note that positions matter.

We need to place A, N, E in positions that are not 3,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that they can't be in those positions again? It says they are in the word but wrong position. Actually, the feedback per letter only tells that in the guess, that specific letter was not in the correct position. But since we know they are in the word, we can place them in any position except the one we already tried? Not exactly. The feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So for the secret word, A is present and not at position 3. Similarly for N and E.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we'll assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise.

So constraints:
- The secret word has A, but not in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in position 4.
- The secret word has E, but not in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain C or R.

And the word has 5 letters.

We need a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E (each at least once) and two other letters (not C, R).

We can try to put A, N, E in different positions and choose common other letters.

Consider positions 1 to 5.

For the new guess, we want to test:
- Put A in a new position: say position 1,2,4, or 5? But avoiding position 3.
- Similarly for N: avoid position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 available.
- E: avoid position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 available.

But we have to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of a word with A, N, E and two more common consonants or vowels.

Some possibilities: 
- ""anode"": A at 1, N at 2, O (new letter), D (new letter), E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, that doesn't mean E cannot be in position 5 in our guess? Actually, our guess can have E at position 5 even if the secret doesn't. We are testing.

But note: the feedback for E in the previous guess: E was in position 5 and got a '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has E but not at the end (position 5). Therefore, in our next guess, we can put E anywhere to test positions.

However, if we put E at position 5 again, we already know it won't be correct, but we might learn about other positions? Or better to put it in a new position.

Similarly, A should avoid position 3, and N avoid position 4.

So ideally, we want to shift A, N, E to other positions.

Let me form a word:

Perhaps: ""PENAL"" -> P, E, N, A, L
Positions: P(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), L(5)
Check positions: 
- A is at 4 -> but we know A isn't at 3? So 4 is new.
- N is at 3 -> avoiding position 4? So that's allowed.
- E is at 2 -> avoiding position 5? Yes.

Also, we introduce P and L.

Another word: ""PANEL"": P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)
But A is at position 2 -> fine.
N at position 3 -> fine.
E at position 4 -> fine (avoiding 5).

But note: E is at a new position (4) and we avoid the forbidden positions.

Another possibility: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters? 5 are needed. So no.

""ALINE"" -> 5 letters? A-L-I-N-E. So: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). 
But N is at position 4? We cannot put N at position 4 because the previous feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4? Wait, the previous guess had N at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So the secret word has N but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, no: we are allowed to put it at position 4 again? But we know it's not correct, so that would be inefficient. Moreover, if we put N at position 4 again, we might get a '-' again, meaning we learn nothing new? Or even an 'x' if the word has duplicate? But we don't know duplicates.

But the feedback system: if we put N at position 4 again and it's not the correct position, we get '-' again. But we already know N isn't at 4, so we are wasting a letter position.

Therefore, we should avoid placing A, N, E in the same positions as last time? Only that:

Specifically, we know:
- A: not position 3? So we can put it at 1,2,4,5? But we should try a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.
- Similarly, N: avoid position 4? So try 1,2,3,5.
- E: avoid position 5? So try 1,2,3,4.

So ideally, put them in positions they haven't been tested.

For example:
- Put A in position 1: then we try if it's at the beginning.
- Put A in position 2: new.
- Position 4 or 5? But E cannot be in position 5? But A can be in position 5.

Similarly, N: put in position 1,2,3,5? We avoid 4.

E: put in 1,2,3,4? Avoid 5.

So, let's design:

One idea: put A in position 1? Then what? Some words: ANKLE? But A(1), N(2), K new, L new, E(5) -> but E(5) again? We know that E is not at position 5 in the secret? So if we put E(5), we'll get '-' again? Unless the secret has duplicate Es? But we don't know.

That might be inefficient. Similarly, if we put N at position 3? etc.

Another word: ""LEAVE""? But note we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Also we can only have one N? But ""LEAVE"" doesn't have N? So it must have A and E? But we know the secret has both N and E? So we cannot skip N? Because we know N is in the word? We cannot omit any known present letters? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal? Because we need to test new positions and letters.

But we know there are 5 letters? And we have to include A, N, E? So that's 3 letters? Plus 2 more? If we omit one of them, we might miss information? For example, if we don't include N, we wouldn't test N in a new position? So better to include A, N, E? And two new letters? That's what we have.

In ""crane"":
- We learned that A, N, E are present? And C,R are absent.

So in next guess, we should keep A,N,E? Because they are in the word? And try them in new positions? Plus two new letters.

So words that contain A,N,E? With two additional letters? And not C,R.

Consider ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E? Positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? But note:
- A is in position 3 again? But we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Because the feedback said A was at 3 and was wrong? So if we put A at 3 again, we'll get '-' again? And possibly L might not be used effectively? Also, N at position 4? Which we know is wrong? And E at position 5? Which we know is wrong? This word ""PLANE"" has the same pattern? So it would be bad? Because only P and L are tested? But we cannot test the known letters in new positions? So no, we avoid.

Therefore, we need to shift the positions.

Example: ""PANED"": P-A-N-E-D -> position: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5)? That exists? Yes, as an architectural term? But may be obscure? Not very common.

But let's check positions:
- A is at position 2: previously tested at 3? Now it's new? So we test if A is at 2? If we get ✓ or '-'?
- N at position 3: previously at 4? New position? So test N at 3?
- E at position 4: previously at 5? Now at 4? We test E at 4?

We avoid the forbidden positions: A not in 3, N not in 4, E not in 5? So we are using new positions? And introduce P and D.

But perhaps a more common word?

Another: ""SLATE""? But ""slate"" does not contain N? But we know N must be in the word? So if we guess ""SLATE"", we wouldn't include N? Then if the secret has N, we would get feedback for S,L,A,T,E? Possibly missing N? So not ideal? Because we know the word has N? So we should include N.

Therefore, we need a word with A, N, E? And two other letters? With A not at 3? N not at 4? E not at 5? And avoid C,R? And common word.

Possibilities: 
""ANKLE"": A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5)? But E is at position 5? Which we know is incorrect? So that position E will be '-' again? So E(5) would waste.

But N is at position 2? But we haven't tested N at 2? So we learn something? And K and L are new? But E(5) redundant? Not entirely? Because it's still testing the letter? But we know that E at 5 is wrong? So the '-' feedback for E doesn't add new information? Except confirming E is in the word? Which we already know? And testing that it's not duplicated? But if we get an 'x' for E? We don't? Because we know E is present? So it's inefficient? Better to test E at a new position? So we get feedback whether E might be elsewhere? Indeed.

So let me avoid position 5 for E? As we should.

Similarly, for N? We should avoid position 4? But in ""ANKLE"", N is at 2? Position 4? L can be at position 4? That's fine.

But we need to move E away from position 5? So ""ANKLE"" is not good? Because E is at 5.

Alternative: ""LEARN""? But we cannot use R? Because R was excluded? Previous feedback? C and R are absent? So no R? ""LEARN"" contains R? Invalid? Cannot use R.

So avoid R.

Therefore: ""PLANE"" is bad? As it has A in 3? Which we know ? Also N in 4? E in 5? All the same.

What about ""PATEN""? P-A-T-E-N? Positions: P(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)? That exists? A type of plate.

Positions: 
- A at 2: new position? Previously 3? So now position 2? And E at position 4? Which avoids position 5? And N at position 5? Which avoids position 4? So N at 5? This is a new position.

So: 
- A not at 3? This guess uses position 2? Good.
- N not at 4? This guess uses position 5? Good.
- E not at 5? This guess uses position 4? Good.
It avoids the previous bad positions? We test all known letters in new positions? Introduce P and T? Common letters.

Another common word: ""PAINT""? PAINT has P, A, I, N, T? It includes A and N? But misses E? Because we have E as a known letter? But ""PAINT"" doesn't have E? Then we wouldn't test E? And we know E is in the secret? So if we guess PAINT, and E is not in PAINT, then the feedback will not cover E? So we don't learn E's position? And we might get an x for E? Actually, we are guessing PAINT? The feedback would be P? A? I? N? T? We get feedback for each letter? So if E is in the secret? But we didn't put E? Then the letter E would not be guessed? So we get no information? We know E is still in the word? But we don't test E? So we'll have to leave E for another turn? Not efficient? Better to include E? To test its position.

Therefore, we need a word that includes A, N, and E? Plus two new? And arrange them appropriately.

Another word: ""PANEL""? P-A-N-E-L? Positions: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)? Now:
- A at position 2: correct? Avoids position 3.
- N at position 3: avoids position 4? But previously N was at 4? So now tested at 3?
- E at position 4: avoids position 5? So good? Positions?
But we have L at position 5? Which is one of the new letters? And E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Good.

So ""panel"" includes A,N,E? And P,L? Neither C nor R? Good.

But note: E is at position 4? Which is fine? Because the secret E is not at position 5? So position 4 is new? We haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? N at position3? Both new positions? Compared to before? Previously A at position3, N at position4? So now we test A at position2? N at position3? E at position4? And introduce P and L? P is common? L is common? Good word.

Another option: ""ANODE""? A-N-O-D-E? But E at position 5? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position5? So if we put E at position5 again? We should get '-'? We learn only that E is still in the word? Not its position? We already know? So inefficient? So I avoid? Use ""panel"" instead.

So I'll choose ""PANEL"".

But wait? In ""panel"": 
Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E, 5:L

We test:
- P at position 1? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 
- E at position 4? 
- L at position 5?

And we know that the secret word has A, N, E? So the feedback will tell us about their positions? And about P and L.

This seems efficient.

Therefore, guess ""panel"".

If we get any ?, we can use that information? But we are supposed to make one guess.

So I'll go with ""PANEL"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":
- C is absent from the secret word (x)
- R is absent from the secret word (x)
- A is present but not in position 3 (-)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word contains A, N, and E, while excluding C and R. For the next guess, I need a word that includes A, N, and E but places them in new positions to test their correct locations:
- A cannot be in position 3 (tested)
- N cannot be in position 4 (tested)
- E cannot be in position 5 (tested)
- The guess must introduce two new letters not yet evaluated (excluding C and R).

### Reasoning
- The goal is to reposition A, N, and E to reveal more information. For instance:
  - A should be tested in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 instead of 3.
  - N should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 instead of 4.
  - E should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 instead of 5.
- To avoid inefficiency, minimize repeating the same positions for known letters (since feedback would reaffirm existing knowledge).
- Common letters like P and L are introduced to cover more possibilities efficiently.
- The word ""PANEL"" fits these constraints:
  - A is in position 2 (new position)
  - N is in position 3 (new position)
  - E is in position 4 (new position)
  - Letters P and L are new and not excluded (C/R).
  - ""PANEL"" is a valid English word, helping test the configuration.

If A, N, or E are correct in these new positions, they may get ""✓"" (correct position). If not, ""−"" will indicate they're elsewhere. P and L may reveal new information (e.g., presence/position).

<guess>panel</guess>",panel,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

We know that A, N, and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Also, C and R are absent.

The secret word contains A, N, E, and two other letters (since there are 5 letters). Since C and R are out, we need to avoid those.

Our goal is to make a new guess that includes A, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"". Also, we must not use C or R.

In ""crane"", the positions were:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

So, for the next guess:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We want to try a word that has A, N, E and two new letters. We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: we can try letters like T, L, S, O, U, etc.

We also note that the word must contain A, N, E, and two others (which could be among the unused letters).

Let's think of words that include A, N, E.

Some words: 
- lane (but only 4 letters) -> so no, must be 5 letters.
- plane -> but that's 5 letters? P-L-A-N-E. But we don't know about P and L. Also, note that positions matter.

We need to place A, N, E in positions that are not 3,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that they can't be in those positions again? It says they are in the word but wrong position. Actually, the feedback per letter only tells that in the guess, that specific letter was not in the correct position. But since we know they are in the word, we can place them in any position except the one we already tried? Not exactly. The feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So for the secret word, A is present and not at position 3. Similarly for N and E.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we'll assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise.

So constraints:
- The secret word has A, but not in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in position 4.
- The secret word has E, but not in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain C or R.

And the word has 5 letters.

We need a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E (each at least once) and two other letters (not C, R).

We can try to put A, N, E in different positions and choose common other letters.

Consider positions 1 to 5.

For the new guess, we want to test:
- Put A in a new position: say position 1,2,4, or 5? But avoiding position 3.
- Similarly for N: avoid position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 available.
- E: avoid position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 available.

But we have to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of a word with A, N, E and two more common consonants or vowels.

Some possibilities: 
- ""anode"": A at 1, N at 2, O (new letter), D (new letter), E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, that doesn't mean E cannot be in position 5 in our guess? Actually, our guess can have E at position 5 even if the secret doesn't. We are testing.

But note: the feedback for E in the previous guess: E was in position 5 and got a '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has E but not at the end (position 5). Therefore, in our next guess, we can put E anywhere to test positions.

However, if we put E at position 5 again, we already know it won't be correct, but we might learn about other positions? Or better to put it in a new position.

Similarly, A should avoid position 3, and N avoid position 4.

So ideally, we want to shift A, N, E to other positions.

Let me form a word:

Perhaps: ""PENAL"" -> P, E, N, A, L
Positions: P(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), L(5)
Check positions: 
- A is at 4 -> but we know A isn't at 3? So 4 is new.
- N is at 3 -> avoiding position 4? So that's allowed.
- E is at 2 -> avoiding position 5? Yes.

Also, we introduce P and L.

Another word: ""PANEL"": P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)
But A is at position 2 -> fine.
N at position 3 -> fine.
E at position 4 -> fine (avoiding 5).

But note: E is at a new position (4) and we avoid the forbidden positions.

Another possibility: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters? 5 are needed. So no.

""ALINE"" -> 5 letters? A-L-I-N-E. So: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). 
But N is at position 4? We cannot put N at position 4 because the previous feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4? Wait, the previous guess had N at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So the secret word has N but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, no: we are allowed to put it at position 4 again? But we know it's not correct, so that would be inefficient. Moreover, if we put N at position 4 again, we might get a '-' again, meaning we learn nothing new? Or even an 'x' if the word has duplicate? But we don't know duplicates.

But the feedback system: if we put N at position 4 again and it's not the correct position, we get '-' again. But we already know N isn't at 4, so we are wasting a letter position.

Therefore, we should avoid placing A, N, E in the same positions as last time? Only that:

Specifically, we know:
- A: not position 3? So we can put it at 1,2,4,5? But we should try a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.
- Similarly, N: avoid position 4? So try 1,2,3,5.
- E: avoid position 5? So try 1,2,3,4.

So ideally, put them in positions they haven't been tested.

For example:
- Put A in position 1: then we try if it's at the beginning.
- Put A in position 2: new.
- Position 4 or 5? But E cannot be in position 5? But A can be in position 5.

Similarly, N: put in position 1,2,3,5? We avoid 4.

E: put in 1,2,3,4? Avoid 5.

So, let's design:

One idea: put A in position 1? Then what? Some words: ANKLE? But A(1), N(2), K new, L new, E(5) -> but E(5) again? We know that E is not at position 5 in the secret? So if we put E(5), we'll get '-' again? Unless the secret has duplicate Es? But we don't know.

That might be inefficient. Similarly, if we put N at position 3? etc.

Another word: ""LEAVE""? But note we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Also we can only have one N? But ""LEAVE"" doesn't have N? So it must have A and E? But we know the secret has both N and E? So we cannot skip N? Because we know N is in the word? We cannot omit any known present letters? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal? Because we need to test new positions and letters.

But we know there are 5 letters? And we have to include A, N, E? So that's 3 letters? Plus 2 more? If we omit one of them, we might miss information? For example, if we don't include N, we wouldn't test N in a new position? So better to include A, N, E? And two new letters? That's what we have.

In ""crane"":
- We learned that A, N, E are present? And C,R are absent.

So in next guess, we should keep A,N,E? Because they are in the word? And try them in new positions? Plus two new letters.

So words that contain A,N,E? With two additional letters? And not C,R.

Consider ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E? Positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? But note:
- A is in position 3 again? But we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Because the feedback said A was at 3 and was wrong? So if we put A at 3 again, we'll get '-' again? And possibly L might not be used effectively? Also, N at position 4? Which we know is wrong? And E at position 5? Which we know is wrong? This word ""PLANE"" has the same pattern? So it would be bad? Because only P and L are tested? But we cannot test the known letters in new positions? So no, we avoid.

Therefore, we need to shift the positions.

Example: ""PANED"": P-A-N-E-D -> position: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5)? That exists? Yes, as an architectural term? But may be obscure? Not very common.

But let's check positions:
- A is at position 2: previously tested at 3? Now it's new? So we test if A is at 2? If we get ✓ or '-'?
- N at position 3: previously at 4? New position? So test N at 3?
- E at position 4: previously at 5? Now at 4? We test E at 4?

We avoid the forbidden positions: A not in 3, N not in 4, E not in 5? So we are using new positions? And introduce P and D.

But perhaps a more common word?

Another: ""SLATE""? But ""slate"" does not contain N? But we know N must be in the word? So if we guess ""SLATE"", we wouldn't include N? Then if the secret has N, we would get feedback for S,L,A,T,E? Possibly missing N? So not ideal? Because we know the word has N? So we should include N.

Therefore, we need a word with A, N, E? And two other letters? With A not at 3? N not at 4? E not at 5? And avoid C,R? And common word.

Possibilities: 
""ANKLE"": A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5)? But E is at position 5? Which we know is incorrect? So that position E will be '-' again? So E(5) would waste.

But N is at position 2? But we haven't tested N at 2? So we learn something? And K and L are new? But E(5) redundant? Not entirely? Because it's still testing the letter? But we know that E at 5 is wrong? So the '-' feedback for E doesn't add new information? Except confirming E is in the word? Which we already know? And testing that it's not duplicated? But if we get an 'x' for E? We don't? Because we know E is present? So it's inefficient? Better to test E at a new position? So we get feedback whether E might be elsewhere? Indeed.

So let me avoid position 5 for E? As we should.

Similarly, for N? We should avoid position 4? But in ""ANKLE"", N is at 2? Position 4? L can be at position 4? That's fine.

But we need to move E away from position 5? So ""ANKLE"" is not good? Because E is at 5.

Alternative: ""LEARN""? But we cannot use R? Because R was excluded? Previous feedback? C and R are absent? So no R? ""LEARN"" contains R? Invalid? Cannot use R.

So avoid R.

Therefore: ""PLANE"" is bad? As it has A in 3? Which we know ? Also N in 4? E in 5? All the same.

What about ""PATEN""? P-A-T-E-N? Positions: P(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)? That exists? A type of plate.

Positions: 
- A at 2: new position? Previously 3? So now position 2? And E at position 4? Which avoids position 5? And N at position 5? Which avoids position 4? So N at 5? This is a new position.

So: 
- A not at 3? This guess uses position 2? Good.
- N not at 4? This guess uses position 5? Good.
- E not at 5? This guess uses position 4? Good.
It avoids the previous bad positions? We test all known letters in new positions? Introduce P and T? Common letters.

Another common word: ""PAINT""? PAINT has P, A, I, N, T? It includes A and N? But misses E? Because we have E as a known letter? But ""PAINT"" doesn't have E? Then we wouldn't test E? And we know E is in the secret? So if we guess PAINT, and E is not in PAINT, then the feedback will not cover E? So we don't learn E's position? And we might get an x for E? Actually, we are guessing PAINT? The feedback would be P? A? I? N? T? We get feedback for each letter? So if E is in the secret? But we didn't put E? Then the letter E would not be guessed? So we get no information? We know E is still in the word? But we don't test E? So we'll have to leave E for another turn? Not efficient? Better to include E? To test its position.

Therefore, we need a word that includes A, N, and E? Plus two new? And arrange them appropriately.

Another word: ""PANEL""? P-A-N-E-L? Positions: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)? Now:
- A at position 2: correct? Avoids position 3.
- N at position 3: avoids position 4? But previously N was at 4? So now tested at 3?
- E at position 4: avoids position 5? So good? Positions?
But we have L at position 5? Which is one of the new letters? And E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Good.

So ""panel"" includes A,N,E? And P,L? Neither C nor R? Good.

But note: E is at position 4? Which is fine? Because the secret E is not at position 5? So position 4 is new? We haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? N at position3? Both new positions? Compared to before? Previously A at position3, N at position4? So now we test A at position2? N at position3? E at position4? And introduce P and L? P is common? L is common? Good word.

Another option: ""ANODE""? A-N-O-D-E? But E at position 5? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position5? So if we put E at position5 again? We should get '-'? We learn only that E is still in the word? Not its position? We already know? So inefficient? So I avoid? Use ""panel"" instead.

So I'll choose ""PANEL"".

But wait? In ""panel"": 
Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E, 5:L

We test:
- P at position 1? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 
- E at position 4? 
- L at position 5?

And we know that the secret word has A, N, E? So the feedback will tell us about their positions? And about P and L.

This seems efficient.

Therefore, guess ""panel"".

If we get any ?, we can use that information? But we are supposed to make one guess.

So I'll go with ""PANEL"".Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":
- C is absent from the secret word (x)
- R is absent from the secret word (x)
- A is present but not in position 3 (-)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word contains A, N, and E, while excluding C and R. For the next guess, I need a word that includes A, N, and E but places them in new positions to test their correct locations:
- A cannot be in position 3 (tested)
- N cannot be in position 4 (tested)
- E cannot be in position 5 (tested)
- The guess must introduce two new letters not yet evaluated (excluding C and R).

### Reasoning
- The goal is to reposition A, N, and E to reveal more information. For instance:
  - A should be tested in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 instead of 3.
  - N should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 instead of 4.
  - E should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 instead of 5.
- To avoid inefficiency, minimize repeating the same positions for known letters (since feedback would reaffirm existing knowledge).
- Common letters like P and L are introduced to cover more possibilities efficiently.
- The word ""PANEL"" fits these constraints:
  - A is in position 2 (new position)
  - N is in position 3 (new position)
  - E is in position 4 (new position)
  - Letters P and L are new and not excluded (C/R).
  - ""PANEL"" is a valid English word, helping test the configuration.

If A, N, or E are correct in these new positions, they may get ""✓"" (correct position). If not, ""−"" will indicate they're elsewhere. P and L may reveal new information (e.g., presence/position).",Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,angel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is not in the secret word (x)
- A is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- N is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

We know that A, N, and E are present in the secret word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Also, C and R are absent.

The secret word contains A, N, E, and two other letters (since there are 5 letters). Since C and R are out, we need to avoid those.

Our goal is to make a new guess that includes A, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"". Also, we must not use C or R.

In ""crane"", the positions were:
1. C
2. R
3. A
4. N
5. E

So, for the next guess:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- N cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We want to try a word that has A, N, E and two new letters. We should choose common letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: we can try letters like T, L, S, O, U, etc.

We also note that the word must contain A, N, E, and two others (which could be among the unused letters).

Let's think of words that include A, N, E.

Some words: 
- lane (but only 4 letters) -> so no, must be 5 letters.
- plane -> but that's 5 letters? P-L-A-N-E. But we don't know about P and L. Also, note that positions matter.

We need to place A, N, E in positions that are not 3,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that they can't be in those positions again? It says they are in the word but wrong position. Actually, the feedback per letter only tells that in the guess, that specific letter was not in the correct position. But since we know they are in the word, we can place them in any position except the one we already tried? Not exactly. The feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So for the secret word, A is present and not at position 3. Similarly for N and E.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we'll assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise.

So constraints:
- The secret word has A, but not in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in position 4.
- The secret word has E, but not in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain C or R.

And the word has 5 letters.

We need a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E (each at least once) and two other letters (not C, R).

We can try to put A, N, E in different positions and choose common other letters.

Consider positions 1 to 5.

For the new guess, we want to test:
- Put A in a new position: say position 1,2,4, or 5? But avoiding position 3.
- Similarly for N: avoid position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 available.
- E: avoid position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 available.

But we have to choose a word that exists.

Let me think of a word with A, N, E and two more common consonants or vowels.

Some possibilities: 
- ""anode"": A at 1, N at 2, O (new letter), D (new letter), E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, that doesn't mean E cannot be in position 5 in our guess? Actually, our guess can have E at position 5 even if the secret doesn't. We are testing.

But note: the feedback for E in the previous guess: E was in position 5 and got a '-' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has E but not at the end (position 5). Therefore, in our next guess, we can put E anywhere to test positions.

However, if we put E at position 5 again, we already know it won't be correct, but we might learn about other positions? Or better to put it in a new position.

Similarly, A should avoid position 3, and N avoid position 4.

So ideally, we want to shift A, N, E to other positions.

Let me form a word:

Perhaps: ""PENAL"" -> P, E, N, A, L
Positions: P(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), L(5)
Check positions: 
- A is at 4 -> but we know A isn't at 3? So 4 is new.
- N is at 3 -> avoiding position 4? So that's allowed.
- E is at 2 -> avoiding position 5? Yes.

Also, we introduce P and L.

Another word: ""PANEL"": P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)
But A is at position 2 -> fine.
N at position 3 -> fine.
E at position 4 -> fine (avoiding 5).

But note: E is at a new position (4) and we avoid the forbidden positions.

Another possibility: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters? 5 are needed. So no.

""ALINE"" -> 5 letters? A-L-I-N-E. So: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). 
But N is at position 4? We cannot put N at position 4 because the previous feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4? Wait, the previous guess had N at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So the secret word has N but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, no: we are allowed to put it at position 4 again? But we know it's not correct, so that would be inefficient. Moreover, if we put N at position 4 again, we might get a '-' again, meaning we learn nothing new? Or even an 'x' if the word has duplicate? But we don't know duplicates.

But the feedback system: if we put N at position 4 again and it's not the correct position, we get '-' again. But we already know N isn't at 4, so we are wasting a letter position.

Therefore, we should avoid placing A, N, E in the same positions as last time? Only that:

Specifically, we know:
- A: not position 3? So we can put it at 1,2,4,5? But we should try a new position to see if it's correct elsewhere.
- Similarly, N: avoid position 4? So try 1,2,3,5.
- E: avoid position 5? So try 1,2,3,4.

So ideally, put them in positions they haven't been tested.

For example:
- Put A in position 1: then we try if it's at the beginning.
- Put A in position 2: new.
- Position 4 or 5? But E cannot be in position 5? But A can be in position 5.

Similarly, N: put in position 1,2,3,5? We avoid 4.

E: put in 1,2,3,4? Avoid 5.

So, let's design:

One idea: put A in position 1? Then what? Some words: ANKLE? But A(1), N(2), K new, L new, E(5) -> but E(5) again? We know that E is not at position 5 in the secret? So if we put E(5), we'll get '-' again? Unless the secret has duplicate Es? But we don't know.

That might be inefficient. Similarly, if we put N at position 3? etc.

Another word: ""LEAVE""? But note we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Also we can only have one N? But ""LEAVE"" doesn't have N? So it must have A and E? But we know the secret has both N and E? So we cannot skip N? Because we know N is in the word? We cannot omit any known present letters? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal? Because we need to test new positions and letters.

But we know there are 5 letters? And we have to include A, N, E? So that's 3 letters? Plus 2 more? If we omit one of them, we might miss information? For example, if we don't include N, we wouldn't test N in a new position? So better to include A, N, E? And two new letters? That's what we have.

In ""crane"":
- We learned that A, N, E are present? And C,R are absent.

So in next guess, we should keep A,N,E? Because they are in the word? And try them in new positions? Plus two new letters.

So words that contain A,N,E? With two additional letters? And not C,R.

Consider ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E? Positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? But note:
- A is in position 3 again? But we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Because the feedback said A was at 3 and was wrong? So if we put A at 3 again, we'll get '-' again? And possibly L might not be used effectively? Also, N at position 4? Which we know is wrong? And E at position 5? Which we know is wrong? This word ""PLANE"" has the same pattern? So it would be bad? Because only P and L are tested? But we cannot test the known letters in new positions? So no, we avoid.

Therefore, we need to shift the positions.

Example: ""PANED"": P-A-N-E-D -> position: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5)? That exists? Yes, as an architectural term? But may be obscure? Not very common.

But let's check positions:
- A is at position 2: previously tested at 3? Now it's new? So we test if A is at 2? If we get ✓ or '-'?
- N at position 3: previously at 4? New position? So test N at 3?
- E at position 4: previously at 5? Now at 4? We test E at 4?

We avoid the forbidden positions: A not in 3, N not in 4, E not in 5? So we are using new positions? And introduce P and D.

But perhaps a more common word?

Another: ""SLATE""? But ""slate"" does not contain N? But we know N must be in the word? So if we guess ""SLATE"", we wouldn't include N? Then if the secret has N, we would get feedback for S,L,A,T,E? Possibly missing N? So not ideal? Because we know the word has N? So we should include N.

Therefore, we need a word with A, N, E? And two other letters? With A not at 3? N not at 4? E not at 5? And avoid C,R? And common word.

Possibilities: 
""ANKLE"": A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5)? But E is at position 5? Which we know is incorrect? So that position E will be '-' again? So E(5) would waste.

But N is at position 2? But we haven't tested N at 2? So we learn something? And K and L are new? But E(5) redundant? Not entirely? Because it's still testing the letter? But we know that E at 5 is wrong? So the '-' feedback for E doesn't add new information? Except confirming E is in the word? Which we already know? And testing that it's not duplicated? But if we get an 'x' for E? We don't? Because we know E is present? So it's inefficient? Better to test E at a new position? So we get feedback whether E might be elsewhere? Indeed.

So let me avoid position 5 for E? As we should.

Similarly, for N? We should avoid position 4? But in ""ANKLE"", N is at 2? Position 4? L can be at position 4? That's fine.

But we need to move E away from position 5? So ""ANKLE"" is not good? Because E is at 5.

Alternative: ""LEARN""? But we cannot use R? Because R was excluded? Previous feedback? C and R are absent? So no R? ""LEARN"" contains R? Invalid? Cannot use R.

So avoid R.

Therefore: ""PLANE"" is bad? As it has A in 3? Which we know ? Also N in 4? E in 5? All the same.

What about ""PATEN""? P-A-T-E-N? Positions: P(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)? That exists? A type of plate.

Positions: 
- A at 2: new position? Previously 3? So now position 2? And E at position 4? Which avoids position 5? And N at position 5? Which avoids position 4? So N at 5? This is a new position.

So: 
- A not at 3? This guess uses position 2? Good.
- N not at 4? This guess uses position 5? Good.
- E not at 5? This guess uses position 4? Good.
It avoids the previous bad positions? We test all known letters in new positions? Introduce P and T? Common letters.

Another common word: ""PAINT""? PAINT has P, A, I, N, T? It includes A and N? But misses E? Because we have E as a known letter? But ""PAINT"" doesn't have E? Then we wouldn't test E? And we know E is in the secret? So if we guess PAINT, and E is not in PAINT, then the feedback will not cover E? So we don't learn E's position? And we might get an x for E? Actually, we are guessing PAINT? The feedback would be P? A? I? N? T? We get feedback for each letter? So if E is in the secret? But we didn't put E? Then the letter E would not be guessed? So we get no information? We know E is still in the word? But we don't test E? So we'll have to leave E for another turn? Not efficient? Better to include E? To test its position.

Therefore, we need a word that includes A, N, and E? Plus two new? And arrange them appropriately.

Another word: ""PANEL""? P-A-N-E-L? Positions: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)? Now:
- A at position 2: correct? Avoids position 3.
- N at position 3: avoids position 4? But previously N was at 4? So now tested at 3?
- E at position 4: avoids position 5? So good? Positions?
But we have L at position 5? Which is one of the new letters? And E at position 4? Which we haven't tested before? Good.

So ""panel"" includes A,N,E? And P,L? Neither C nor R? Good.

But note: E is at position 4? Which is fine? Because the secret E is not at position 5? So position 4 is new? We haven't tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? N at position3? Both new positions? Compared to before? Previously A at position3, N at position4? So now we test A at position2? N at position3? E at position4? And introduce P and L? P is common? L is common? Good word.

Another option: ""ANODE""? A-N-O-D-E? But E at position 5? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position5? So if we put E at position5 again? We should get '-'? We learn only that E is still in the word? Not its position? We already know? So inefficient? So I avoid? Use ""panel"" instead.

So I'll choose ""PANEL"".

But wait? In ""panel"": 
Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E, 5:L

We test:
- P at position 1? 
- A at position 2? 
- N at position 3? 
- E at position 4? 
- L at position 5?

And we know that the secret word has A, N, E? So the feedback will tell us about their positions? And about P and L.

This seems efficient.

Therefore, guess ""panel"".

If we get any ?, we can use that information? But we are supposed to make one guess.

So I'll go with ""PANEL"".Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":
- C is absent from the secret word (x)
- R is absent from the secret word (x)
- A is present but not in position 3 (-)
- N is present but not in position 4 (-)
- E is present but not in position 5 (-)

The secret word contains A, N, and E, while excluding C and R. For the next guess, I need a word that includes A, N, and E but places them in new positions to test their correct locations:
- A cannot be in position 3 (tested)
- N cannot be in position 4 (tested)
- E cannot be in position 5 (tested)
- The guess must introduce two new letters not yet evaluated (excluding C and R).

### Reasoning
- The goal is to reposition A, N, and E to reveal more information. For instance:
  - A should be tested in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 instead of 3.
  - N should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 instead of 4.
  - E should be tested in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 instead of 5.
- To avoid inefficiency, minimize repeating the same positions for known letters (since feedback would reaffirm existing knowledge).
- Common letters like P and L are introduced to cover more possibilities efficiently.
- The word ""PANEL"" fits these constraints:
  - A is in position 2 (new position)
  - N is in position 3 (new position)
  - E is in position 4 (new position)
  - Letters P and L are new and not excluded (C/R).
  - ""PANEL"" is a valid English word, helping test the configuration.

If A, N, or E are correct in these new positions, they may get ""✓"" (correct position). If not, ""−"" will indicate they're elsewhere. P and L may reveal new information (e.g., presence/position).

Also, C and R are absent.\n\nThe secret word contains A, N, E, and two other letters (since there are 5 letters). Since C and R are out, we need to avoid those.\n\nOur goal is to make a new guess that includes A, N, E, but in different positions than in ""crane"". Also, we must not use C or R.\n\nIn ""crane"", the positions were:\n1. C\n2. R\n3. A\n4. N\n5. E\n\nSo, for the next guess:\n- A cannot be in position 3.\n- N cannot be in position 4.\n- E cannot be in position 5.\n\nWe want to try a word that has A, N, E and two new letters. We should choose common letters to maximize information.\n\nPossible new letters: we can try letters like T, L, S, O, U, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must contain A, N, E, and two others (which could be among the unused letters).\n\nLet\'s think of words that include A, N, E.\n\nSome words: \n- lane (but only 4 letters) -> so no, must be 5 letters.\n- plane -> but that\'s 5 letters? P-L-A-N-E. But we don\'t know about P and L. Also, note that positions matter.\n\nWe need to place A, N, E in positions that are not 3,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say that they can\'t be in those positions again? It says they are in the word but wrong position. Actually, the feedback per letter only tells that in the guess, that specific letter was not in the correct position. But since we know they are in the word, we can place them in any position except the one we already tried? Not exactly. The feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So for the secret word, A is present and not at position 3. Similarly for N and E.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But for now, we\'ll assume no duplicates unless feedback suggests otherwise.\n\nSo constraints:\n- The secret word has A, but not in position 3.\n- The secret word has N, but not in position 4.\n- The secret word has E, but not in position 5.\n- The secret word does not contain C or R.\n\nAnd the word has 5 letters.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E (each at least once) and two other letters (not C, R).\n\nWe can try to put A, N, E in different positions and choose common other letters.\n\nConsider positions 1 to 5.\n\nFor the new guess, we want to test:\n- Put A in a new position: say position 1,2,4, or 5? But avoiding position 3.\n- Similarly for N: avoid position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 available.\n- E: avoid position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 available.\n\nBut we have to choose a word that exists.\n\nLet me think of a word with A, N, E and two more common consonants or vowels.\n\nSome possibilities: \n- ""anode"": A at 1, N at 2, O (new letter), D (new letter), E at 5 -> but E is at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5 in the secret word? Wait, that doesn\'t mean E cannot be in position 5 in our guess? Actually, our guess can have E at position 5 even if the secret doesn\'t. We are testing.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E in the previous guess: E was in position 5 and got a \'-\' meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has E but not at the end (position 5). Therefore, in our next guess, we can put E anywhere to test positions.\n\nHowever, if we put E at position 5 again, we already know it won\'t be correct, but we might learn about other positions? Or better to put it in a new position.\n\nSimilarly, A should avoid position 3, and N avoid position 4.\n\nSo ideally, we want to shift A, N, E to other positions.\n\nLet me form a word:\n\nPerhaps: ""PENAL"" -> P, E, N, A, L\nPositions: P(1), E(2), N(3), A(4), L(5)\nCheck positions: \n- A is at 4 -> but we know A isn\'t at 3? So 4 is new.\n- N is at 3 -> avoiding position 4? So that\'s allowed.\n- E is at 2 -> avoiding position 5? Yes.\n\nAlso, we introduce P and L.\n\nAnother word: ""PANEL"": P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)\nBut A is at position 2 -> fine.\nN at position 3 -> fine.\nE at position 4 -> fine (avoiding 5).\n\nBut note: E is at a new position (4) and we avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters? 5 are needed. So no.\n\n""ALINE"" -> 5 letters? A-L-I-N-E. So: A(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). \nBut N is at position 4? We cannot put N at position 4 because the previous feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4? Wait, the previous guess had N at position 4 and it was marked wrong position. So the secret word has N but not at position 4. Therefore, in our new guess, we should avoid putting N at position 4? Actually, no: we are allowed to put it at position 4 again? But we know it\'s not correct, so that would be inefficient. Moreover, if we put N at position 4 again, we might get a \'-\' again, meaning we learn nothing new? Or even an \'x\' if the word has duplicate? But we don\'t know duplicates.\n\nBut the feedback system: if we put N at position 4 again and it\'s not the correct position, we get \'-\' again. But we already know N isn\'t at 4, so we are wasting a letter position.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid placing A, N, E in the same positions as last time? Only that:\n\nSpecifically, we know:\n- A: not position 3? So we can put it at 1,2,4,5? But we should try a new position to see if it\'s correct elsewhere.\n- Similarly, N: avoid position 4? So try 1,2,3,5.\n- E: avoid position 5? So try 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo ideally, put them in positions they haven\'t been tested.\n\nFor example:\n- Put A in position 1: then we try if it\'s at the beginning.\n- Put A in position 2: new.\n- Position 4 or 5? But E cannot be in position 5? But A can be in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, N: put in position 1,2,3,5? We avoid 4.\n\nE: put in 1,2,3,4? Avoid 5.\n\nSo, let\'s design:\n\nOne idea: put A in position 1? Then what? Some words: ANKLE? But A(1), N(2), K new, L new, E(5) -> but E(5) again? We know that E is not at position 5 in the secret? So if we put E(5), we\'ll get \'-\' again? Unless the secret has duplicate Es? But we don\'t know.\n\nThat might be inefficient. Similarly, if we put N at position 3? etc.\n\nAnother word: ""LEAVE""? But note we must include N? Because we know N is in the word? Also we can only have one N? But ""LEAVE"" doesn\'t have N? So it must have A and E? But we know the secret has both N and E? So we cannot skip N? Because we know N is in the word? We cannot omit any known present letters? Actually, we can, but it might not be optimal? Because we need to test new positions and letters.\n\nBut we know there are 5 letters? And we have to include A, N, E? So that\'s 3 letters? Plus 2 more? If we omit one of them, we might miss information? For example, if we don\'t include N, we wouldn\'t test N in a new position? So better to include A, N, E? And two new letters? That\'s what we have.\n\nIn ""crane"":\n- We learned that A, N, E are present? And C,R are absent.\n\nSo in next guess, we should keep A,N,E? Because they are in the word? And try them in new positions? Plus two new letters.\n\nSo words that contain A,N,E? With two additional letters? And not C,R.\n\nConsider ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E? Positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E? But note:\n- A is in position 3 again? But we know A is not at position 3? So we cannot put A at position 3? Because the feedback said A was at 3 and was wrong? So if we put A at 3 again, we\'ll get \'-\' again? And possibly L might not be used effectively? Also, N at position 4? Which we know is wrong? And E at position 5? Which we know is wrong? This word ""PLANE"" has the same pattern? So it would be bad? Because only P and L are tested? But we cannot test the known letters in new positions? So no, we avoid.\n\nTherefore, we need to shift the positions.\n\nExample: ""PANED"": P-A-N-E-D -> position: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), D(5)? That exists? Yes, as an architectural term? But may be obscure? Not very common.\n\nBut let\'s check positions:\n- A is at position 2: previously tested at 3? Now it\'s new? So we test if A is at 2? If we get ✓ or \'-\'?\n- N at position 3: previously at 4? New position? So test N at 3?\n- E at position 4: previously at 5? Now at 4? We test E at 4?\n\nWe avoid the forbidden positions: A not in 3, N not in 4, E not in 5? So we are using new positions? And introduce P and D.\n\nBut perhaps a more common word?\n\nAnother: ""SLATE""? But ""slate"" does not contain N? But we know N must be in the word? So if we guess ""SLATE"", we wouldn\'t include N? Then if the secret has N, we would get feedback for S,L,A,T,E? Possibly missing N? So not ideal? Because we know the word has N? So we should include N.\n\nTherefore, we need a word with A, N, E? And two other letters? With A not at 3? N not at 4? E not at 5? And avoid C,R? And common word.\n\nPossibilities: \n""ANKLE"": A(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5)? But E is at position 5? Which we know is incorrect? So that position E will be \'-\' again? So E(5) would waste.\n\nBut N is at position 2? But we haven\'t tested N at 2? So we learn something? And K and L are new? But E(5) redundant? Not entirely? Because it\'s still testing the letter? But we know that E at 5 is wrong? So the \'-\' feedback for E doesn\'t add new information? Except confirming E is in the word? Which we already know? And testing that it\'s not duplicated? But if we get an \'x\' for E? We don\'t? Because we know E is present? So it\'s inefficient? Better to test E at a new position? So we get feedback whether E might be elsewhere? Indeed.\n\nSo let me avoid position 5 for E? As we should.\n\nSimilarly, for N? We should avoid position 4? But in ""ANKLE"", N is at 2? Position 4? L can be at position 4? That\'s fine.\n\nBut we need to move E away from position 5? So ""ANKLE"" is not good? Because E is at 5.\n\nAlternative: ""LEARN""? But we cannot use R? Because R was excluded? Previous feedback? C and R are absent? So no R? ""LEARN"" contains R? Invalid? Cannot use R.\n\nSo avoid R.\n\nTherefore: ""PLANE"" is bad? As it has A in 3? Which we know ? Also N in 4? E in 5? All the same.\n\nWhat about ""PATEN""? P-A-T-E-N? Positions: P(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), N(5)? That exists? A type of plate.\n\nPositions: \n- A at 2: new position? Previously 3? So now position 2? And E at position 4? Which avoids position 5? And N at position 5? Which avoids position 4? So N at 5? This is a new position.\n\nSo: \n- A not at 3? This guess uses position 2? Good.\n- N not at 4? This guess uses position 5? Good.\n- E not at 5? This guess uses position 4? Good.\nIt avoids the previous bad positions? We test all known letters in new positions? Introduce P and T? Common letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""PAINT""? PAINT has P, A, I, N, T? It includes A and N? But misses E? Because we have E as a known letter? But ""PAINT"" doesn\'t have E? Then we wouldn\'t test E? And we know E is in the secret? So if we guess PAINT, and E is not in PAINT, then the feedback will not cover E? So we don\'t learn E\'s position? And we might get an x for E? Actually, we are guessing PAINT? The feedback would be P? A? I? N? T? We get feedback for each letter? So if E is in the secret? But we didn\'t put E? Then the letter E would not be guessed? So we get no information? We know E is still in the word? But we don\'t test E? So we\'ll have to leave E for another turn? Not efficient? Better to include E? To test its position.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that includes A, N, and E? Plus two new? And arrange them appropriately.\n\nAnother word: ""PANEL""? P-A-N-E-L? Positions: P(1), A(2), N(3), E(4), L(5)? Now:\n- A at position 2: correct? Avoids position 3.\n- N at position 3: avoids position 4? But previously N was at 4? So now tested at 3?\n- E at position 4: avoids position 5? So good? Positions?\nBut we have L at position 5? Which is one of the new letters? And E at position 4? Which we haven\'t tested before? Good.\n\nSo ""panel"" includes A,N,E? And P,L? Neither C nor R? Good.\n\nBut note: E is at position 4? Which is fine? Because the secret E is not at position 5? So position 4 is new? We haven\'t tested before? Similarly, A at position 2? N at position3? Both new positions? Compared to before? Previously A at position3, N at position4? So now we test A at position2? N at position3? E at position4? And introduce P and L? P is common? L is common? Good word.\n\nAnother option: ""ANODE""? A-N-O-D-E? But E at position 5? Which we want to avoid? Because we know E is not at position5? So if we put E at position5 again? We should get \'-\'? We learn only that E is still in the word? Not its position? We already know? So inefficient? So I avoid? Use ""panel"" instead.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""PANEL"".\n\nBut wait? In ""panel"": \nPositions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E, 5:L\n\nWe test:\n- P at position 1? \n- A at position 2? \n- N at position 3? \n- E at position 4? \n- L at position 5?\n\nAnd we know that the secret word has A, N, E? So the feedback will tell us about their positions? And about P and L.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nTherefore, guess ""panel"".\n\nIf we get any ?, we can use that information? But we are supposed to make one guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PANEL"".Based on the previous feedback for the guess ""crane"":\n- C is absent from the secret word (x)\n- R is absent from the secret word (x)\n- A is present but not in position 3 (-)\n- N is present but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-)\n\nThe secret word contains A, N, and E, while excluding C and R.

P and L may reveal new information (e.g., presence/position).\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""panel""
- P: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4
- L: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
1. The secret word has E in position 4 and L in position 5. So the word ends with ""EL"".
2. A and N are present but not in the positions we tried:
   - In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4. But now we know position 4 is E, so N cannot be there. Also, in ""panel"", A was in position 2 and N in position 3, and both were wrong. So A is not in 2 or 3, and N is not in 3 or 4.
3. We have two more letters to find: the first and second positions? The word has positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know:
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: L
   - So the first three positions are unknown, but we know A and N are in the word, so they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But we have three positions and two letters? There must be one more letter that we haven't found yet.

Also, we know that C, R, and P are absent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E L

And it contains A and N, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ""panel"") and not in position 3 or 4 for A and N respectively from ""crane"" (but position 4 is E, so that's consistent). Also, A cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") and we now know it's not in position 2 (from ""panel""). Similarly, N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""panel"").

So for A: cannot be in 2 or 3. The only positions left are 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are E and L, so A must be in position 1? But let's check: positions 1, 2, 3 are available for A, but we know it's not in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 1? Similarly, for N: cannot be in 3 or 4? Position 4 is taken by E, so N cannot be there. And not in 3? So N must be in position 1 or 2? But if A is in position 1, then N must be in position 2? But position 2 is available? However, we have three positions: 1,2,3 and two letters A and N? So one position must be a new letter.

Let me list the constraints:

- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, R, P (absent)
- Position 2: unknown, cannot be C, R, P, and also A is not here (from ""panel"" feedback: A in position 2 was wrong)
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be C, R, P, and also N is not here (from ""panel"": N in position 3 was wrong) and also A is not here (from ""crane"" and ""panel"" both show A not in 3? Actually, from ""crane"" we know A not in 3, and from ""panel"" we know A not in 2? So A cannot be in 2 or 3? So A must be in 1? Because 4 and 5 are fixed.

Similarly, N: from ""crane"" not in 4, from ""panel"" not in 3? And 4 is E, so N must be in 1 or 2? But if A is in 1, then N must be in 2? Then position 3 must be a new letter.

So the word would be: A N ? E L

But we need to confirm: is A allowed in position 1? And N in position 2? We haven't tested A in position 1 or N in position 2? So it's possible.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, the feedback from ""panel"" also tells us that A and N are present but in the wrong positions? So if we put A in position 1 and N in position 2, that would be a new position for A and for N? But we don't know if that's correct? We need to test.

But we have only one unknown letter? So we can try to find words that start with ""AN"" and end with ""EL""? But we have three letters: positions 1,2,3? But if A is in 1 and N in 2, then position 3 is the unknown? So words of the form ""AN?EL"".

But we also know that the unknown letter cannot be C, R, P? And must be a letter that forms a word.

Possible words: 
- ANGEL: G is a new letter? But we don't know about G? 
- ANNUL? But that has two N's? And ends with UL? Not EL? 
- ANKLE? But ends with LE? Not EL? We need EL at the end? Position 4 and 5 are E and L? So ""ANKLE"" has E at 5? But we have E at 4? So no? The word must be ? ? ? E L? So the last two are E and L? So ""ANGEL"" is A N G E L? That fits: positions 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:E, 5:L? But we have E at position 4? And L at 5? Yes.

But is ""ANGEL"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if it matches the feedback? We have A in position 1? But in previous guesses, A was in position 3 (crane) and 2 (panel)? Both wrong? So if A is in position 1, that's new? Similarly, N in position 2? Previously in position 4 (crane) and 3 (panel)? Both wrong? So position 2 is new? And G is new? 

But we have feedback that A is present? So if we put A in position 1, and it's correct? Then we get ✓? Or if not? But we don't know? Similarly for N.

But we also have to consider: in ""panel"", we had A in position 2 and it was wrong? So if the secret has A in position 1? Then in ""panel"", A was in position 2? That would be a different position? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? Which it was? Similarly for N? In ""panel"", N was in position 3? But if the secret has N in position 2? Then it's not at position 3? So the feedback was correct? Marked as wrong position? So it's consistent.

But we don't know if A is in position 1? It could be? But we have to guess.

But we have another possibility? What if A is not in position 1? But we said A cannot be in 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are E and L? So A must be in 1? There is no other position? Similarly, N must be in 1 or 2? But if A is in 1, then N must be in 2? Because if N is in 1, then A must be somewhere else? But A cannot be in 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are taken? So N cannot be in 1? Because if N is in 1, then A has no place? So the only possibility is A in 1, N in 2? And a new letter in 3? So the word is ""AN?EL"".

Therefore, we need to guess a word that starts with ""AN"" and ends with ""EL"", with one letter in between? But the last two are fixed? So the word is ""AN"" + one letter + ""EL""? But that's 5 letters? ""ANXEL"" where X is the middle letter? But that's not a word? ""ANGEL"" is the only common one? Or ""ANNEX""? But ""ANNEX"" ends with X? Not EL? We need the last two to be E and L? So ""ANGEL"" is A N G E L? Yes.

But are there others? ""ANVIL""? But ends with IL? Not EL? ""AXEL""? But that's A X E L? Only 4 letters? Or 5? A-X-E-L? That's 4? ""Axel"" is 4 letters? We need 5? ""Axels"" is 5? But ends with LS? Not EL? So ""ANGEL"" seems the only common word? Or ""ANGEL"" is one.

But what about ""ANODE""? But ends with ODE? Not EL? So no.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""ANGEL""? But we need to confirm with the feedback? We have to make a guess? So we can guess ""ANGEL"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities? What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could A be in position 1 and also elsewhere? But we don't have any indication of duplicates? And in the feedback, we only have one A? So probably not? Similarly for others? So we assume no duplicates? So ""ANGEL"" is a strong candidate.

But we must consider: in the first guess ""crane"", we had A in position 3? And it was present but wrong position? If the secret is ""ANGEL"", then A is in position 1? So in ""crane"", A was in position 3? Which is wrong? So that matches? Similarly, N in ""crane"" was in position 4? But in ""ANGEL"", N is in position 2? So position 4 is E? So N was in the wrong position? Correct? And in ""panel"", A was in position 2? But in ""ANGEL"", A is in position 1? So position 2 is N? So A in position 2 is wrong? And N in position 3? But in ""ANGEL"", N is in position 2? So position 3 is G? So N in position 3 is wrong? And E and L are correct? So all feedback matches.

Therefore, we can guess ""ANGEL"".

But we have only 6 tries? And we are on guess 3? So we can try.

But to be thorough, are there other words? For example, what if the word is ""EXCEL""? But we know C is absent? From guess 1? C is x? So no? Or ""LEVEL""? But we have E at position 4? And L at 5? But ""LEVEL"" has E at 1 and 3? And L at 2 and 5? And V at 4? But we need E at 4? So not? The secret has E at 4? So ""LEVEL"" has E at 1,3? And L at 2,5? So position 4 is V? But we need E at 4? So not? Similarly, ""HOTEL""? But we don't have H? And we don't know? But we have A and N to place? ""HOTEL"" has no A or N? But we know A and N are present? So no? Similarly, ""MODEL""? No A or N? So only ""ANGEL"" fits? Or perhaps ""JEWEL""? But no A or N? So no.

Another word: ""HAZEL""? But no N? And we have A? But no N? But we know N is present? So must have N? So ""ANGEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or ""ANGEL"" is one? Also, ""ANGEL"" uses G? Which we haven't tested? But that's fine.

So I think we should guess ""ANGEL"".

But let's see the response format? We need to output the guess.

So <guess>angel</guess>

But we are to think step by step? So I think we have it.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `C` and `R` are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `A`, `N`, and `E` are **present** but in the wrong positions (not position 3, 4, or 5, respectively).  

- **Guess 2: ""panel""**  
  Feedback: `P(x) A(-) N(-) E(✓) L(✓)`  
  Interpretation:  
  - `P` is **absent** from the secret word.  
  - `A` and `N` are **present** but in the wrong positions (not position 2 or 3, respectively).  
  - `E` is **correct** at position 4.  
  - `L` is **correct** at position 5.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 4 is `E` (from `E(✓)` in ""panel"").  
   - Position 5 is `L` (from `L(✓)` in ""panel"").  
   - Thus, the secret word ends with `EL` (i.e., `??EL`).  

2. **Present Letters with Position Constraints**:  
   - `A` is present but **cannot be in position 2 or 3** (tested in ""panel"" and ""crane"").  
   - `N` is present but **cannot be in position 3 or 4** (tested in ""panel"" and ""crane"").  
   - Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, `A` and `N` must occupy positions 1 and/or 2.  
     - `A` cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in position 1 (only remaining option).  
     - `N` cannot be in 3 or 4 → must be in position 2 (only remaining option after `A` in 1).  
   - Therefore, the secret word starts with `AN` (i.e., `AN?EL`).  

3. **Absent Letters**:  
   - `C`, `R`, and `P` are confirmed absent (cannot be used).  

4. **Unknown Position**:  
   - Position 3 is the only unknown letter. It must be a new letter (not `A`, `N`, `E`, `L`, or absent letters).  

5. **Word Structure**:  
   - The secret word must be a valid English word of the form `AN?EL`.  
   - Common words fitting this pattern:  
     - `ANGEL` (meaning: a spiritual being).  
     - No other common English words fit (e.g., `ANVIL` ends in `IL`, `ANNEX` ends in `EX`, `AXELS` is plural and ends in `LS`).  

### Conclusion:
- The only feasible word is **`ANGEL`**.  
  - `A` in position 1 (new position, untested).  
  - `N` in position 2 (new position, untested).  
  - `G` in position 3 (new letter).  
  - `E` in position 4 (confirmed correct).  
  - `L` in position 5 (confirmed correct).  
- This guess tests all constraints:  
  - `A` and `N` are placed in new positions (1 and 2) to verify their correctness.  
  - `G` is introduced to test the unknown position 3.  

<guess>angel</guess>",angel,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""panel""
- P: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: present, wrong position (-)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4
- L: correct position (✓) at position 5

From this, we know:
1. The secret word has E in position 4 and L in position 5. So the word ends with ""EL"".
2. A and N are present but not in the positions we tried:
   - In ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4. But now we know position 4 is E, so N cannot be there. Also, in ""panel"", A was in position 2 and N in position 3, and both were wrong. So A is not in 2 or 3, and N is not in 3 or 4.
3. We have two more letters to find: the first and second positions? The word has positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We know:
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: L
   - So the first three positions are unknown, but we know A and N are in the word, so they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3? But we have three positions and two letters? There must be one more letter that we haven't found yet.

Also, we know that C, R, and P are absent.

So the secret word is: _ _ _ E L

And it contains A and N, but not in positions 2 or 3 (from ""panel"") and not in position 3 or 4 for A and N respectively from ""crane"" (but position 4 is E, so that's consistent). Also, A cannot be in position 3 (from ""crane"") and we now know it's not in position 2 (from ""panel""). Similarly, N cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""panel"").

So for A: cannot be in 2 or 3. The only positions left are 1? Because positions 4 and 5 are E and L, so A must be in position 1? But let's check: positions 1, 2, 3 are available for A, but we know it's not in 2 or 3? So it must be in position 1? Similarly, for N: cannot be in 3 or 4? Position 4 is taken by E, so N cannot be there. And not in 3? So N must be in position 1 or 2? But if A is in position 1, then N must be in position 2? But position 2 is available? However, we have three positions: 1,2,3 and two letters A and N? So one position must be a new letter.

Let me list the constraints:

- Position 1: unknown, but cannot be C, R, P (absent)
- Position 2: unknown, cannot be C, R, P, and also A is not here (from ""panel"" feedback: A in position 2 was wrong)
- Position 3: unknown, cannot be C, R, P, and also N is not here (from ""panel"": N in position 3 was wrong) and also A is not here (from ""crane"" and ""panel"" both show A not in 3? Actually, from ""crane"" we know A not in 3, and from ""panel"" we know A not in 2? So A cannot be in 2 or 3? So A must be in 1? Because 4 and 5 are fixed.

Similarly, N: from ""crane"" not in 4, from ""panel"" not in 3? And 4 is E, so N must be in 1 or 2? But if A is in 1, then N must be in 2? Then position 3 must be a new letter.

So the word would be: A N ? E L

But we need to confirm: is A allowed in position 1? And N in position 2? We haven't tested A in position 1 or N in position 2? So it's possible.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, the feedback from ""panel"" also tells us that A and N are present but in the wrong positions? So if we put A in position 1 and N in position 2, that would be a new position for A and for N? But we don't know if that's correct? We need to test.

But we have only one unknown letter? So we can try to find words that start with ""AN"" and end with ""EL""? But we have three letters: positions 1,2,3? But if A is in 1 and N in 2, then position 3 is the unknown? So words of the form ""AN?EL"".

But we also know that the unknown letter cannot be C, R, P? And must be a letter that forms a word.

Possible words: 
- ANGEL: G is a new letter? But we don't know about G? 
- ANNUL? But that has two N's? And ends with UL? Not EL? 
- ANKLE? But ends with LE? Not EL? We need EL at the end? Position 4 and 5 are E and L? So ""ANKLE"" has E at 5? But we have E at 4? So no? The word must be ? ? ? E L? So the last two are E and L? So ""ANGEL"" is A N G E L? That fits: positions 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:E, 5:L? But we have E at position 4? And L at 5? Yes.

But is ""ANGEL"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if it matches the feedback? We have A in position 1? But in previous guesses, A was in position 3 (crane) and 2 (panel)? Both wrong? So if A is in position 1, that's new? Similarly, N in position 2? Previously in position 4 (crane) and 3 (panel)? Both wrong? So position 2 is new? And G is new? 

But we have feedback that A is present? So if we put A in position 1, and it's correct? Then we get ✓? Or if not? But we don't know? Similarly for N.

But we also have to consider: in ""panel"", we had A in position 2 and it was wrong? So if the secret has A in position 1? Then in ""panel"", A was in position 2? That would be a different position? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? Which it was? Similarly for N? In ""panel"", N was in position 3? But if the secret has N in position 2? Then it's not at position 3? So the feedback was correct? Marked as wrong position? So it's consistent.

But we don't know if A is in position 1? It could be? But we have to guess.

But we have another possibility? What if A is not in position 1? But we said A cannot be in 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are E and L? So A must be in 1? There is no other position? Similarly, N must be in 1 or 2? But if A is in 1, then N must be in 2? Because if N is in 1, then A must be somewhere else? But A cannot be in 2 or 3? And 4 and 5 are taken? So N cannot be in 1? Because if N is in 1, then A has no place? So the only possibility is A in 1, N in 2? And a new letter in 3? So the word is ""AN?EL"".

Therefore, we need to guess a word that starts with ""AN"" and ends with ""EL"", with one letter in between? But the last two are fixed? So the word is ""AN"" + one letter + ""EL""? But that's 5 letters? ""ANXEL"" where X is the middle letter? But that's not a word? ""ANGEL"" is the only common one? Or ""ANNEX""? But ""ANNEX"" ends with X? Not EL? We need the last two to be E and L? So ""ANGEL"" is A N G E L? Yes.

But are there others? ""ANVIL""? But ends with IL? Not EL? ""AXEL""? But that's A X E L? Only 4 letters? Or 5? A-X-E-L? That's 4? ""Axel"" is 4 letters? We need 5? ""Axels"" is 5? But ends with LS? Not EL? So ""ANGEL"" seems the only common word? Or ""ANGEL"" is one.

But what about ""ANODE""? But ends with ODE? Not EL? So no.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""ANGEL""? But we need to confirm with the feedback? We have to make a guess? So we can guess ""ANGEL"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities? What if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could A be in position 1 and also elsewhere? But we don't have any indication of duplicates?

So in ""crane"", A was in position 3? Which is wrong? So that matches? Similarly, N in ""crane"" was in position 4? But in ""ANGEL"", N is in position 2? So position 4 is E? So N was in the wrong position? Correct? And in ""panel"", A was in position 2? But in ""ANGEL"", A is in position 1? So position 2 is N? So A in position 2 is wrong? And N in position 3? But in ""ANGEL"", N is in position 2? So position 3 is G? So N in position 3 is wrong? And E and L are correct? So all feedback matches.

Therefore, we can guess ""ANGEL"".

But we have only 6 tries? And we are on guess 3? So we can try.

But to be thorough, are there other words? For example, what if the word is ""EXCEL""? But we know C is absent? From guess 1? C is x? So no? Or ""LEVEL""? But we have E at position 4? And L at 5? But ""LEVEL"" has E at 1 and 3? And L at 2 and 5? And V at 4? But we need E at 4? So not? The secret has E at 4? So ""LEVEL"" has E at 1,3? And L at 2,5? So position 4 is V? But we need E at 4? So not? Similarly, ""HOTEL""? But we don't have H? And we don't know? But we have A and N to place? ""HOTEL"" has no A or N? But we know A and N are present? So no? Similarly, ""MODEL""? No A or N? So only ""ANGEL"" fits? Or perhaps ""JEWEL""? But no A or N? So no.

Another word: ""HAZEL""? But no N? And we have A? But no N? But we know N is present? So must have N? So ""ANGEL"" is the only common word that fits? Or ""ANGEL"" is one? Also, ""ANGEL"" uses G? Which we haven't tested? But that's fine.
